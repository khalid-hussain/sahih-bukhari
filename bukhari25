Creation</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: What has come of the words of Allah Almighty<I>, "It is He who originated
creation and then regenerates it. That is extremely easy for Him.</I>"
(30:27)</B>
<P>
Ar-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym and al-Hasan said, "All is easy for Him." <I>Hayn</I>
and <I>hayyin</I> (easy) are like <I>layn</I> and <I>layyin</I> (supple),
<I>mayt</I> and <I>mayyit</I> (dead), and dayq and <I>dayyiq</I> (narrow).
<P>
<I>"Were We then exhausted (a fa'ay&icirc;n&acirc;)?" </I>(50:15) means "Did
it weary Us when We formed you and formed your creation?" <I>Lugh&uuml;b</I>
(sense of weariness) (35:35) and in (50:38) means fatigue. <I>Atw&acirc;r</I>
(successive stages) (71:14) is a stage like this and a stage like that, and
He determined its stages.
<P>
3018. It is related that 'Imran ibn Husayn said, "A group came from the Banu
Tamim to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said,
'Banu Tamim, rejoice!' They said, 'You have given us good news, so give us
something.' His face changed colour. Then the people of Yemen came and he
said, 'O people of Yemen! Accept the good news since Banu Tamim have not
accepted it.' They said, 'We accept,' so the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, began to speak about the beginning of creation and the
Throne. Then a man came and said, ''Imran! Your camel has run off!' I wish
that I had not got up."
<P>
3019. It is related that 'Imran ibn Husayn said, "I visited the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and hobbled my camel at the door.
Some people of Banu Tamim came and he said, 'Accept the good news, Banu Tamim!'
They said twice, 'You have given us good news, so give us something.' Then
some of the people of Yemen came in to him and he said, Accept the good news,
O people of Yemen, since Banu Tamim have not accepted it.' They said, 'We
accept, Messenger of Allah. We have come to you to ask you about this matter.'
He said, 'There was Allah and there was nothing but Him, and His Throne was
on the water. He wrote everything in the Remembrance (the Tablet) and He
created the heavens and the earth.' Then someone called out, 'Your she-camel
has gone, Ibn al-Husayn!' So I went and could not see her because of the
mirage. By Allah, I wish that I had left her!"
<P>
3020. It is related that 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, stood up among us and informed us about the beginning of
creation until the point where the people of the Garden enter their places
and the people of the Fire enter their places. Whoever remembered it remembered
it, and whoever forgot it forgot it."
<P>
3021. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, as I think, 'Allah Almighty said, "The son
of Adam has abused Me, and it is not his place to abuse Me, and He has denied
Me, and it is not his to do that. His abuse is that he says that I have a
son, and his denying is that he says, 'He will not bring me back as He originated
me.'"'"
<P>
3022. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When Allah finished creation, He wrote
in a book which is with Him above the Throne, 'My mercy predominates over
My wrath.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: What has come about the seven earths</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "It is Allah who created the seven heavens
and of the earth the same number, the Command descending down through all
of them, so that you might know that Allah has power over everything and
that Allah encompasses all things in His knowledge." </I>(65:12)
<P>
<I>"The Raised Canopy," </I>(52:5) is the heaven. "<I>Its canopy" </I>(79:28)
is its structure in which there is life. <I>"Its oscillating orbits" </I>(51:7)
is its regularity and beauty.<I> "It hearkens" </I>(84:5) is that it listens
and obeys. <I>"It disgorges what is inside it</I> (of the dead) <I>and empties
out." </I>(84:4)<I> "And what extendeded it,</I>" (91:6) refers to how it
is spread out. <I>"At once they will be on the surfave, wide awake
(bi's-sahira)</I>" (79:14) is the face of the earth in which the living slept
and then awakened.
<P>
3023. It is related from Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman that there was a dispute
regarding land between him and some people and he visited 'A'isha and mentioned
that to her. She said, "Abu Salama! Avoid taking land unjustly. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If anyone wrongs someone
else even to the extent of a piece of land measuring a hand's width, his
neck will be encircled with it from the the seven earths.'"
<P>
3024. It is related that the father of Salim reported that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone takes and land without
right, on the Day of Rising, he will be swallowed up in the seven earths."
<P>
3025. It is related from Abu Bakra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Time has continued cyclically in the same way
since the day Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is twelve
months, four of which are sacred. Three are consecutive: Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l-Hijja
and al-Muharram, and there is Rajab of Mudar which is between Jumada and
Sha'ban. "
<P>
3026. It is related that Sa'id ibn Zayd ibn 'Umar ibn Nufayl had litigation
instigated against him by Arwa bint Aws before Marwan. She claimed that he
had taken some of her due. Sa'id said, "Would I take any of her land after
what I heard from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace?" Marwan asked, "What did you hear from the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace?" He replied, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Anyone who wrongfully
takes a hand's width of land will wear it round his neck down through seven
earths.'"
<P>
Hisham related from his father, "Sa'id ibn Zayd said to me, 'I visited the
Prophet...'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III: On Stars</B>
<P>
Qatada said about <I>"We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps,"</I>
(67:4) "The creation of these stars was for three reasons: to make them an
adornment for the heaven, objects with which to stone the shaytans, and signs
by which people are guided. Whoever considers them for other than that has
erred and wasted his portion and imposed on himself that of which he has
no knowledge."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "<I>Hash&icirc;m</I> (dry stubble) (18:45) is'"altered.'
<I>Abb</I> (fodder) (80:31) is what cattle eat. <I>An&acirc;m</I> (creatures)
(55:10) means creatures. <I>Barzakh</I> (interspace) (23:100) (55::20) is
a screen." Mujahid said that <I>alf&acirc;f</I> (luxurious growth) (78:16)
is dense growth, and <I>ghulb</I> (dense) (80:30) also means "dense".
<I>Fir&acirc;sh</I> (a couch) (2:22) is a resting place, which is like His
words,<I> "You will have residence on the earth." </I>(2:36; 7:24).
<I>Nakid</I> (that which is niggardly) (7:58 means "scant".
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The description of the sun and the moon running with precision (cf.
55:5)</B>
<P>
Mujahid said that it is like the circumference (<I>husban</I>) of the mill-stone.
Another said that it is according to a precise reckoning (<I>hisab</I>) and
stages which they do not exceed. <I>Husb&acirc;n</I> is the plural of
<I>his&acirc;b</I> (reckoning), like <I>shih&acirc;b</I> and <I>shuban</I>.
<P>
<I>Duh&acirc;h&acirc;</I> (its splendour) (91:1) is its light.<I> "...to
ovetake the moon" </I>(36:40) means that the light of one of them does not
veil the light of the other, and that is not proper for them.<I> "Outstrip
the day" </I>(36:40) means that they do not race one another. <I>"We peel
away" </I>(36:37) means "We remove one of them from the other and We make
each of them continue." <I>W&acirc;hiya</I> (flimsy) (69:16) is that its
weakness will make it split apart. <I>Arj&acirc;'ih&acirc; </I>(its sides)
(69:17) is what is split from it, so they are on its edges, as you say, "On
the edge of the well." <I>Aghtash</I> (He darkens) (79:29) and <I>janna</I>
(6:76) both mean "to make dark".
<P>
Al-Hasan said that <I>kuwwirat</I> (when it is folded up) (81:1) means that
it will be folded up so that is light departs. <I>"The Night and all it shrouds"
</I>(84:17) is the gathering of animals. "<I>Fullness</I>" (84:18) is evenness.
<I>"Buruj" </I>(15:16; 25:61) refers to the stages of the sun and moon.
<I>Har&uuml;r</I> (heat) (35:21) is in the day by the sun.
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas and Ru'aba said that <I>harur</I> is heat at night and
<I>sammum</I> is in the day. One says <I>yuliju</I> (merges into) (22:61)
for folded up, and <I>wal&icirc;ja</I> (9:16) is everything that enters into
something.
<P>
3027. It is related from Abu Dharr that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, asked Abu Dharr when the sun set, "'Do you know where
it goes?' I replied, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'It goes
until it prostrates under the Throne. Then it asks permission and is given
permission. It is nearly the time when it will prostrate and it will not
be accepted from it, and it will ask permission and will not be given permission.
It will be told, "Go back from whence you came,' and it will rise in the
west. That is the words of Allah Almighty,<I> "And the sun runs to its resting
place. That is the decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing."' </I>(36:38)"
<P>
3028. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The sun and the moon will be folded up on the
Day of Rising."
<P>
3029. It is related that Ibn 'Umar reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, "The sun and the moon are not eclipsed because of
anyone's life or death. Rather they are two of the signs of Allah. When you
see them, pray."
<P>
3030. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The sun and moon are two of Allah's
signs. They are not eclipsed for the life or death of anyone. When you see
an eclipse, remember Allah."
<P>
3031. It is related from 'A'isha, "There was an eclipse of the sun one day
and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood
and made a long recitation. Then did a long <I>ruku'</I>. Then he raised
his head and said, 'Allah hears whoever praises him.' He stood where he was
and recited a long recitation which was close to the first recitation. Then
he he did a long <I>ruku' </I>which was close to the first <I>ruku'</I>.
Then he prostrated a long recitation. Then he did in the second<I> rak'at
</I>the like of that. Then he said the <I>taslim</I> and the sun had cleared.
He addressed the people and spoke about the eclipse of the sun and moon,
'The sun and moon are two of Allah's signs. They are not eclipsed for the
life or death of anyone. When you see an eclipse, then go to the prayer.'"
<P>
3032. It is related from Abu Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The sun and the moon are not eclipsed because
of anyone's death. Rather they are two of the signs of Allah. When you see
them, then pray."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: What has come about His words, <I>"It is He who sends out the winds,
bringing advance news of His mercy."</I> (25:48)</B>
<P>
<I>Q&acirc;sif</I> (a gale) (17:69) is a wind which smashes everything.
<I>Law&acirc;qih</I> (fecundating winds) (15:22) are those winds which fertilise.
<I>I's&acirc;r </I>(whirlwind) (2:266) is a fierce wind which blows from
the earth to the heaven like a pillar in which there is a fire. <I>Sirr</I>
(nipping frost) (3:117) is cold. <I>Nushur</I> (77:3) is "scattering".
<P>
3033. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "I was helped to victory by the east wind and
'Ad was destroyed by the west wind."
<P>
3034. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, saw a cloud in the sky, he would walk to and fro,
and go in and go out again and his face would change colour. When it rained,
that would leave him." 'A'isha informed him about that and the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I do not know. Perhaps it will
be like the people, <I>'When they saw it as a storm cloud advancing on their
valleys...'</I> (46:24)"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Concerning angels</B>
<P>
Anas said, "'Abdullah ibn Salam said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace,'Among the angels, Jibril is the enemy of the Jews.'"
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that <I>"We are those drawn up in ranks" </I>(37:165) refers
to the angels.
<P>
3035. It is related from Malik ibn Sa'sa'a that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "While I was at the House, between sleep and
being awake, (and he mentioned) between two men, I was brought a golden tray
filled with wisdom and belief. My chest was opened from the throat to the
lower abdomen and then my abdomen was was washed with Zamzam water and then
it was filled with wisdom and belief. I was brought a white animal, smaller
than a mule and larger than a donkey: al-Buraq. I went with Jibril until
we reached the lowest heaven. It was said, 'Who is this?' He replied, 'Jibril.'
It was asked, 'Who is with you?' He answered, 'Muhammad.' It was said, 'Has
he been sent for?' 'Yes,' was the answer. It was said, 'Welcome to him! What
an excellent visitor has come!' I came to Adam and greeted him. He said,
'Welcome to you, a son and a Prophet!' We reached the second heaven and it
was said, 'Who is this?' He replied, 'Jibril.' It was said, 'Who is with
you?' He answered, 'Muhammad.' It was said, 'Has he been sent for?' He replied,
'Yes.' It was said, 'Welcome to him! What an excellent visitor has come!'
I came to 'Isa and Yahya and they said, 'Welcome to you, a brother and a
Prophet!' We reached the third heaven and it was said, 'Who is this?' He
said, 'Jibril.' It was said, 'Who is with you?' He said, 'Muhammad.' It was
said, 'Has he been sent for?' He said, 'Yes.' It was said, 'Welcome to him!
What an excellent visitor has come!' I came to Yusuf and greeted him and
he said, 'Welcome to you, a brother and a Prophet!' We reached the fourth
heaven and it was said, 'Who is this?' He replied, 'Jibril.' It was asked,
'Who is with you?' He answered, 'Muhammad.' It was said, 'Has he been sent
for?' He replied, 'Yes.' It was said, 'Welcome to him! What an excellent
visitor has come!' I came to Idris and greeted him, and he said, 'Welcome
to you, a brother and a Prophet!' We reached the fifth heaven and it was
asked, 'Who is this?' He replied, 'Jibril.' It was asked, 'Who is with you?'
He said, 'Muhammad.' It was said, 'Has he been sent for?' He answered, 'Yes.'
It was said, 'Welcome to him! What an excellent visitor has come!' We came
to Harun and I greeted him and he said, 'Welcome to you, a brother and a
Prophet!' We reached the sixth heaven and it was said, 'Who is this?' He
replied, 'Jibril.' It was said, 'Who is with you?' He answered, 'Muhammad.'
It was said, 'Has he been sent for?' He answered, 'Yes.' It was said, 'Welcome
to him! What an excellent visitor has come!' I came to Musa, peace be upon
him, and he said, 'Welcome to you, a brother and a Prophet!' When I pased
on, he wept, and was asked, 'Why are you weeping?' He said, 'O Lord, more
of the community of this lad who was sent after me will enter the Garden
than those of my community!' We reached the seventh heaven, and it was said,
'Who is this?' He replied, 'Jibril.' It was said, 'Who is with you?' He said,
'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been sent for?' He replied, 'Yes.' It was
said, 'Welcome to him! What an excellent visitor has come!' I came to Ibrahim
and greeted him. He said, 'Welcome to you, a son and a Prophet!'
<P>
"The Inhabited House was shown to me and I questioned Jibril who said, 'This
is the Inhabited House. Every day seventy thousand angels pray in it, and
when they leave, they do not return to it. It is the first and last time
they enter. Then I was shown the Lote-tree of the Limit and its fruits were
like the pots of Hajar, and its leaves were like elephant ears. At its root
spring four rivers: two hidden rivers and two visible rivers. I asked Jibril
and he said, 'The two hidden ones are in the Garden, and the two visible
ones are the Nile and Euphrates.' Then fifty prayers were made obligatory
for me.
<P>
"I went until I came to Musa who said, 'What did you do?' I said, 'Fifty
prayers were made obligatory for me.' He said, 'I know people better than
you. I had a terrible experience with the tribe of Israel. Your community
will not be capable of it. So back to your Lord and ask Him.' I went back
and asked and He made it forty. Then the like of it happened, and it was
thirty, and then the like of it and He made it twenty, and then the like
of it and He made it ten. Then I went to Musa and he said the like of it
and He made it five. I went to Musa and he said, 'What have you done?' I
said, "He made it five.' He said the like of that, but I said, 'I have submitted
to what is good.' There was a call, 'I have imposed My obligation and have
lightened it for My slaves and I will repay the good action with ten.'"
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "In the Inhabited House."
<P>
3036. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, who is the truthful confirmed one, said, 'The
way that each of you is created is that you are gathered in your mother's
womb for forty days as a sperm-drop and then for a similar length of time
as a blood-clot and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh.
Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into you and is encharged
with four commandments: to write down your provision, your life-span, your
actions, and whether you will be wretched or happy. Then the spirit is breathed
into him. So a man among you can do the actions of someone destined for the
Garden until there is only an armspan between him and it, and then what is
written will overtake him and he will do the actions of someone destined
for the Fire . A man among you can do the actions of someone destined for
the Fire until there is only an armspan between him and it, and then what
is written will overtake him and he will do the actions of someone destined
for the Garden.'"
<P>
3037. It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace...
<P>
It is corroborated from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "When Allah loves a slave, He calls out to Jibril,
'Allah loves so-and-so, so love him!' and Jibril loves him. Then a call goes
out among the people of heaven, ''Allah loves so-and-so, so love him!' and
the people of heaven love him. Then acceptance is placed in the earth for
him."
<P>
3038. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, that she heard
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "The
angels descend in the mists, which are the clouds, and mention that something
has been decreed in the heaven. The shaytans eavesdrop and hear it and then
reveal it to the soothsayers, and they add a hundred lies to it from themselves."
<P>
3039. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, ""On the Day of Jumu'a, the angels stand at
the every door of the mosque and write down the first to come and then those
who follow. When the Imam comes out, they roll up their scrolls and listen
to the reminder."
<P>
3040. It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "'Umar passed by in
the mosque while Hassan was reciting poetry. He said, "I used to recite in
it when there was someone better than you in it!' Then he returned to Abu
Hurayra and said, "'I ask you by Allah, did you hear the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Hassan, reply in defence of
me. O Allah, help him by means of the Pure Spirit!"' Abu Hurayra said, 'Yes.'"
<P>
3041. It is related that al-Bara' said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to Hassan, "Satirise them - and Jibril is with
you."
<P>
3042. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "It is as if I could see the
dust rising in the alley of the Banu Ghanm."
<P>
Musa added, "By the procession of Jibril."
<P>
3043. It is related from 'A'isha that al-Harith ibn Hisham asked the Messenger
of Allah, "How does the revelation come to you?" He answered, "All these
ways. Sometimes like the ringing of a bell which then leaves me after I have
fully understood and retained what was said - and this is the hardest on
me. Sometimes the angel comes to me in the form of a man and speaks to me
and I retain what he says."
<P>
3044. It is related from Abu Hurayra that he heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace,said, "If someone spends two things in the
way of Allah, the guardians of the Garden, every guardian of a gate, call
to him, 'O so-and-so! Come!' Abu Bakr said, 'Messenger of Allah, that is
the one who will not be destroyed!' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'I hope that you will be one of them.'"
<P>
3045. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to her, "O 'A'isha, this is Jibril who gives the greeting
to you." She said, "And upon him be peace and the mercy of Allah and His
blessings. You see what I do not see," meaning the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace.
<P>
3046. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, asked Jibril, 'Why do you not visit us more
often than you do?'" He said, "Then it was sent down, <I>'We do not descend
except at your Lord's command.Everything in front of us, and everything behind
us, and everything in between belongs to Him.' </I>(19:64)"
<P>
3047. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;said, "Jibril read to me in one mode,
and I continued to ask him for more until it reached seven modes
(<I>ahruf</I>)."
<P>
3048. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was the most generous of people, and he was
even more generous in Ramadan when Jibril met him. He used to met him every
night in Ramadan to go through the Qur'an with him. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was more generous with good than
the blowing wind."
<P>
The like is related with this <I>isnad</I>. Abu Hurayra and Fatima related
from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that Jibril used
to read the Qur'an to him.
<P>
3049. It is related from Ibn Shihab that one day 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz
delayed the <I>'Asr</I> prayer a little. 'Urwa said to him, "Jibril descended
and prayed in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace." 'Umar said,, "Know what you are relating, 'Urwa!". He said, "I
heard Bashir ibn Abi Mas'ud say that he heard Abu Mas'ud say that he heard
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Jibril
descended and led me in the prayer, and I prayed with him, and then I prayed
with him, and then I prayed with him, and then I prayed with him, and then
I prayed with him,' counting the five prayers with his fingers."
<P>
3050. It is related from Abu Dharr that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Jibril said to me, "Anyone of your community
who dies without associating anything with Allah will enter the Garden (or
"will not enter the Fire")."' He said, 'Even he if fornicates and even if
he steals?' He said, 'Even so.'"
<P>
3051. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are angels which take turns in
being with you in the night and other angels in the day and they meet together
at the prayers of <I>Fajr</I> and <I>'Asr</I>. Then the ones who were with
you during the night ascend and Allah asks them - although He knows better
than they do - 'How were My slaves when you left them?' They say, 'When we
left them they were praying and when we came to them, they were praying.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: When one of you says, "Amen," as do the angels in the heaven, and
they coincide with one another, he will be forgiven his past wrong actions.</B>
<P>
3052. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I stuffed a cushion with some pictures
on it for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which was
like a small cushion. He came and stood between the two doors and his face
began to change. I asked, 'What have we done, Messenger of Allah?' He replied,
'What is this cushion?' I said, 'It is a cushion I have put for you to recline
on.' He said, 'Do you not know that the angels do not enter a house which
contains an image? On the Day of Rising, those who made these imageswill
be punished and will be told, "Bring what you created to life."'"
<P>
3053. It is related that Abu Talha heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Angels do not enter a house in which
there is a dog or the image of a living creature."
<P>
3054. It is related from Busr ibn Sa'id that Zayd ibn Khalif al-Juhani related
to him while he was with 'Ubadyullah al-Khawlani who had been in the care
of Maymuna, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
Zayd ibn Khalid related to them that Abu Talha had related to him that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The angels do not
enter a house in which there is an image."
<P>
Busr said, "Zayd ibn Khalid became ill and we visited him. In his room we
saw a curtain which had images on it. I said to 'Ubaydullah al-Khawlani,

on cloth." Did you not hear it?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Indeed he mentioned
it.'"
<P>

actions.'"
<P>
3057. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "One of you is in the prayer as long as he is
waiting for the prayer, and the angels say, 'O Allah, forgive him! O Allah,
show mercy to him!' as long as you do not rise from the place in which you
prayed and do not break <I>wudu'</I>."
<P>

Mali!'"
<P>
3059. It is related from 'A'isha that she asked the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, "Have you ever experienced a worse day than the
day of Uhud?" He replied, "I experienced much harm from your people, and
the worst that I experienced from them was on the Day of 'Aqaba when I presented
myself to Ibn 'Abdu Yalil ibn 'Abd Kulal and he did not grant me what I wanted.
I went off in great grief and felt no relief until I arrived at Qarn
ath-Tha'alib. Then I lifted my head and there was a cloud shading me, and
I looked and in it was Jibril, and he called to me and said, 'Allah Almighty
has heard what your people have said to you and how they answered you. Allah
has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you for you to command him to do whatever
you wish to them.' The Angel of the Mountains called to me and greeted me
and then said, 'O Muhammad, order what you will? If you like, I will crush
them with the two heavy mountains.'" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Rather I hope that Allah will produce from their
loins people who worship Allah alone without associating anything with Him."
<P>

his Lord, has committed an enormity. Rather he saw Jibril in his real form,
and his created form blocked out the horizon."
<P>

words,<I> "Then he drew near and hung suspended. He was two bows'-lengths
away or even closer."</I> (53:8-9)?' She said, 'That was Jibril. He used
to come to him in the form of a man, and this time he came to him in his
form which is his real form, and he blocked out the horizon.'"
<P>
3064. It is related that Samura said the Prophet, may Allah bless him and

Jibril and this is Mika'il.'"
<P>

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Then the revelation was
interrupted for me for a time, and while I was out walking, I heard a voice
from heaven. I raised my eyes and there was the same angel who had come to
me at Hira'. He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was
so afraid of him that I fell to the ground and I went to my family and said,
'Wrap me up! Wrap me up!' Then Allah sent down,<I> 'O you enveloped in your
cloak! Arise and warn. Magnify your Lord. Purify your clothes. Shun all
filth.'</I> (74:1-5)"

men Shanu'a, and I saw 'Isa, a man of medium height, medium complexion, tending
to redness and white and straight hair. I saw Malik, the guardian of the
Fire. The Dajjal was one of the signs which Allah showed me. <I>'Be in no
doubt about the meeting with him.'</I> (32:23)
<P>
Anas and Abu Bakr reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, "Angels will guard Madina against the Dajjal."

<B>VIII: What has come about the description of the Garden and that it is
created</B>
<P>
Abu'l-'Aliyya said that its people are "pure" from menstruation, urine and
spittle. <I>"When they are given fruit there as provision"</I> i.e. when
they are given something, then are brought something else. <I>"They will
say, 'This is what we were given before"</I> is what we were given earlier.
<I>"For they were only a simulation of it"</I> (2:25) means they resemble

(<I>widan</I>) of a she-camel."
<P>
<I>Kawb</I> (goblet) is that which has no handle. <I>Abariq</I> are vessels
with handles. <I>'Urub</I> (56: 18) means of like age, and the singular is
<I>'ar&uuml;b</I>, like <I>sab&uuml;r</I> and <I>subur</I>. The people of
Makka are called <I>al-'Ariba</I> and the people of Madina are

people of the Fire, it is among the people of the Fire."
<P>
3069. It is related from 'Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet, may Allah bless

self knows the delight that is hidden away for it in recompense for what
it used to do." </I>(32:18)'"
<P>
3073. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The first group to enter the Garden
will be like the moon on the night of the full moon. They will not need to
spit nor blow their noses nor defecate. Their vessels will be golden and
their combs will be gold and silver. Their braziers will burn fragrant aloes-wood
and their perspiration will be like musk. Each of them will have two wives,
so beautiful that the marrow of their thighs will be able to be seen through
the flesh, and there will be no disagreement between them nor any ill will.
Their hearts will be one, glorifying Allah morning and evening."
<P>

in His hand, the handkerchief of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh in the Garden is better
than this!'"
<P>
3077. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib was heard to say, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was given a silk garment

is better than what the rises or sets on."
<P>

them." They asked, "O Messenger of Allah, are those the stations of the Prophets
which only they attain?" He replied, "Rather, by the One in whose hand my
soul is, they are men who believed in Allah and confirmed the Messengers."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Description of the Gates of the Garden</B>

"<I>Ghassaq</I>" (78:25) is used for fluid from eye and fluid from a wound.
It appears that <I>ghasaq</I> and <I>ghasq</I> are the same. "<I>Ghislin</I>"

That is <I>ghislin</I>, which is from the wound and the back [of camels].

Abyssinian. Another said that <I>h&acirc;sib</I> (17:68) means a tempestuous
wind. <I>Hasib</I> is what the wind throws into the air, and from that comes
the <I>hasib</I> of Hell which is what is thrown into <I>Jahannam</I> and
they are your fuel. One says <I>hasaba</I> to refer to "going into the earth".
<I>Hasab</I> is derived from stone pebbles. <I>Sad&icirc;d</I> (14:16) is
pus and blood. <I>Khabat</I> (17:97) means "to be extinguished". <I>Turun</I>

<I>Ghayy</I> (19:59) is loss. Mujahid said that "<I>yusjar&uuml;n</I>" (40:72)
is "to kindle fire on them". <I>Nuhas</I> (55:35) is brass which is poured
on their heads. It is said that "<I>taste"</I> (22:22) is direct touch and
experience. This is not tasting which occurs in the mouth. <I>Marij</I> (55:15)
is pure fire. One uses the verb <I>maraja</I> of the subjects of an amir
when he lets them fight one another. <I>Marij</I> (50:5) is confused. When
it is used of the state of the people, they are muddled. <I>"He has let loose
the two seas." </I>(55:19) When the verb is used about an animal, one lets
it go.

of Jahannam.'"

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Fire complained
to its Lord, 'O Lord, part of me consumes the other part.' So He gave it
permission to breathe out twice - one breath in the winter and one in the
summer. The breath in the summer is the most intense heat you feel and the
breath in the winter, the most intense cold you feel."
<P>
3088. It is related that Abu Jamra ad-Duba'i said, "I used to sit with Ibn
'Abbas in Makka and came down with a fever. He said. "Cool is for yourself
with Zamzam water. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'The fever comes from the blast of Jahannam, so cool it with water,'
or he said, 'with Zamzam water.' (Hammam was unsure.)"

3094. It is said that Abu Wa'il said, "It was said to Usama, 'Will you go
to so-and-so ['Uthman] and speak to him [about what is happening]?' He said,
"You think that I do not speak to him except when you hear? I speak to him
secretly without opening a door which I do not wish to be the first to open.
Nor will I say to a man who is amir over me that he is the best of people
after something which I heard from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace." They asked, "What did you hear him say?" He said,
"I heard him say, "A man will be brought on the Day of Rising and thrown
into the Fire and the intestines of his belly will come out and he will be
dragged round by them as the donkey goes round the mill. The people of the
Fire will gather round him and say, "So-and-so! What has happened to you?
Did you not command the right and forbid the wrong?" He will say, "Yes. I
used to command the right and forbid the wrong and then do it.'"

master"</I> (17:62) means "to tame". "<I>Qar&icirc;n</I>" (43:36) is Shaytan.
<P>
3095. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was bewitched so that he would imagine that he had done
a thing which he had not done it until one day he made supplication and did
so again. Then he said, 'Are you aware that Allah has informed me of that
in which my cure lies? Two men came to me and one of them sat at my head
and the other and at my feet, and one asked the other, "What ails the man?"
He answered, "Bewitched." He asked, "And who has bewitched him?" He replied,
"Labid ibn al-A'sam." He said, "Using what?" He replied, "A comb, flax and
the husk of a male palm spathe." He asked, "Where is it?" He said, "In the
well of Dharwan."' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
went out to it and then came back." He said to 'A'isha when he returned,
"Its palms are like the heads of devils." I asked, "Did you take it out?'
He said, 'No, for Allah has cured me and I fear that that would provoke evil
among the people.' Then the well was stopped up."
<P>
3096. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Shaytan ties three knots at the back
of your heads when you are asleep. He hits every knot with the words, 'You
have a long night ahead of you so sleep tight.' When you wake up and remember
Allah, one knot is undone. When you do <I>wudu',</I> one knot is undone.
When you pray, one knot is undone. So morning finds you cheerful and energetic.
Otherwise, morning finds you lazy and foul-tempered.'"
<P>
3097. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "A man was mentioned in the presence
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it was said
of him that he had continued to sleep into the morning without having got
up for the prayer. He said, 'Shaytan urinated in his ear (or ears).'"
<P>
3098. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him

the name of Allah. O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect any child
You grant us from Shaytan,' and a child is decreed for them, Shaytan will
not harm him."

Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the edge of the sun appears,
then leave the prayer until it has appeared, and when the edge of the sun
sets, then leave the prayer until it has set. Do not pray at sunset or sunset.
The sun rises between the horns of a shaytan - or Shaytan." (I do not think
that Hisham said that.)
<P>
3100. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, "When one of you is praying and someone
tries to pass in front of him, he should stop him. If he resists, he should
stop him. If he still resists, then use force for he is nothing but a shaytan."'"

food. I grabbed him and said, 'By Allah, I will take you to the Messenger
of Allah!' - and he mentioned the <I>hadith</I> - "He said, 'When you go
to bed, recite the Throne Verse, and you will have someone guarding over
you from Allah and shaytan will not come near you until morning.' The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'He told you the truth even
though he is a liar. That was Shaytan.'" 
<P>
3102. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may

back again, insinuating himself between a man and his heart and saying, 'Think
of such-and-such, think of such-and-such,' until the man does not know if
he has prayed three or four <I>rak'ats</I>. If he does not know whether he

a day has the equivalent of freeing a hundred slaves, and a hundred good
deeds are written for him and a hundred evil deeds are effaced from him,

do better than what he has done except someone who had done more than that."

and grant him peace, gave him permission to enter and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was laughing. 'Umar said, 'May Allah
make you laugh, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'I am amazed at those women
who were with me. When they heard your voice, they rushed to screen themselves.'
'Umar said, 'But you, Messenger of Allah, are more entitled to be feare!.'
Then he said, 'O enemies of your selves! Do you fear me and not fear the
Messenger of Allah?' They said, 'Yes, you are harsher and more severe than

hand my soul is, whenever Shaytan finds you taking a path, he only takes
a path other than your path.'"

<B>XII: Concerning the jinn, and their reward and punishment</B>
<P>
by His words<I>, "'O company of jinn! You gained many followers among mankind.'
And their friends among mankind will say, 'Our Lord, we took benefit from
each other, and now we have reached the term which You determined for us.'
He will say, 'The Fire is your home. You will be in it timelessly, forever,
except as Allah wills. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.' In that way We
make the wrongdoers friends of one another because of what they have done.
'O company of jinn and men! Did not Messengers come to you from among you
relating My Signs to you and warning you of the encounter of this Day of
yours?' They will say, 'We testify against ourselves.' The life of this world
deluded them and they testify against themselves that they were rejectors.
That was because their Lord would never have destroyed the cities unjustly
while their people were unwarned. All have ranks according to what they did.
Your Lord is not heedless of anything they do."</I> (6:130&#150;132)
<P>

Allah's words, <I>"But the jinn know very well that they will be arraigned"

mobilised"</I> (36:75) is in the Reckoning.

prayer and raise your voice when doing it. No jinn or man or anything within
range hears the voice of the <I>mu'adhdhin</I> without bearing witness for
him on the Day of Rising." Abu Sa'id said, "I heard this from the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
<P>

and I do not know what they did. But I think that they must have been turned
into rats. If you put camel's milk in front of them, they will not drink.
If you put sheep's milk in front of them, then they drink.' I spoke to Ka'b
and he asked, 'You heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
say that?' I said, 'Yes.' He asked me that several times. I said, 'Am I reading
the Torah?'"

skin of a snake. He said, 'Look for it.' They looked and he said, 'Kill it.'
So I used to kill them on that account. Then I met Abu Lubaba and he informed
me that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said, 'Do
not kill the [white] j&acirc;nn but only the short-tailed dhu't-tufaytan.
It causes miscarriages and loss of sight. Kill it.'"
