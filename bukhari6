the One who Prays</A></BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: The Imam's <I>sutra</I> is also the <I>sutra</I> for those behind him</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t41">471</A>. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I came
riding up on a donkey while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was leading the people in prayer at Mina, and I was at that
time nearing puberty. I passed in front of part of the row, dismounted, sent
the donkey off to graze, and then joined the row, and no one rebuked me for
doing so."
<P>
472. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that when the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came out on the day of the <I>'Id</I>, he ordered
a spear to be placed in front of him and prayed towards it with the people
behind him. He used to do that on journeys. The amirs adopted this practice
from that time.
<P>
473. It is related from 'Awn ibn Abi Juhayfa, "I heard my father say that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led them in prayer
at al-Batha' with a short spear in front of him - two <I>rak'ats </I>for
<I>Dhuhr</I> and two<I> rak'ats</I> for <I>'Asr</I>. Women and donkeys passed
in front of him.
<P>
<P>
<B>II: What should be the distance between the person praying and the
<I>sutra</I></B>
<P>
474. It is related that Sahl said, "Between the place where the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed and the wall there
was room for a sheep to walk past."
<P>
475. It is related that Salama said, "There was just room for a sheep to
pass between the wall of the mosque and the minbar."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Praying facing a spear</B>
<P>
476. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to have a spear set up for him and would pray facing
it.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Praying facing a short spear</B>
<P>
477. It is related that 'Awn ibn Abi Juhayfa said, "I heard my father say,
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out
to us at midday and was brought <I>wudu'</I> water and did <I>wudu</I>'.
Then he led us in the <I>Dhuhr</I> and <I>'Asr </I>prayers with a short spear
in set up front of him. Women and donkeys were passing behind it.'"
<P>
478. It is was related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "When the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to relieve himself, I and
a boy followed him. We had a staff, a stick or a short spear and a water
container. When he finished relieving himself, we gave him the container."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The <I>sutra</I> in Makka and elsewhere</B>
<P>
479. It is related that Abu Juhayfa said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came out to us at midday and prayed two
<I>rak'ats </I>for <I>Dhuhr</I> and two<I> rak'ats </I>for <I>'Asr </I>at
al-Batha' with a shor spear set up in front of him. He did<I> wudu'</I> and
the people rubbed themselves with his <I>wudu' </I>water.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Praying facing a pillar</B>
<P>
'Umar said, "Those who are praying are more entitled to the pillars than
those conversing." 'Umar saw a man praying between two pillars and moved
him up to a pillar and said, "Pray towards it."
<P>
480. It is related that Yazid ibn 'Ubayd said, "I used to come with Salama
ibn al-Akwa' and he would pray behind the pillar where the Qur'an was kept.
I said, 'Abu Muslim, I see that you are keen to pray by this pillar.' He
said, 'I saw that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
keen to pray there.'"
<P>
481. It is related that Anas said, "I saw the greatest of the Companions
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, hurrying to the
pillars at <I>Maghrib</I>."
<P>
Shu'ba added (in his variant from Anas), "until the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came out."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Praying between the pillars outside the group prayer</B>
<P>
482. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, entered the House with Usama ibn Zayd, 'Uthman ibn Talha
and Bilal. He stayed there a long time and then came out. I was the first
person to enter after him and I asked Bilal where he had prayed. He said,
'Between the two front pillars.'"
<P>
483. It is related from Ibn 'Umar, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, entered Ka'ba with Usama ibn Zayd, 'Uthman ibn Talha
and Bilal, closed the door and remained there for a while. When he came out,
I asked Bilal, 'What did the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
do?' He said, 'He placed himself with one pillar to his left and one to his
right and three pillars behind him (At that time, the House had six pillars
supporting it) and then he prayed.'"
<P>
Malik related that there were two pillars to his right.
<P>
484. It is related from Nafi' that whenever 'Abdullah entered the Ka'ba,
he would walk straight ahead when he entered, with the door directly behind
him. He walked on until there was about three cubits between him and the
wall in front of him where he prayed, seeking the place where Bilal told
him that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had prayed.
He said, "There is no harm in anyone praying in any part of the House he
likes."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Praying towards a she-camel, any other camel, a tree or a
saddle-bag</B>
<P>
485. It is related from Nafi', "Ibn 'Umar said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to make his she-camel sit sideways and he would
pray towards it.' I said, 'What would happen if the camel was startled.'
He said, 'He would take the saddle, set it up and pray towards its end of
it - or he said its back.' Ibn 'Umar used to do that.
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Praying towards a bed</B>
<P>
486. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Do you equate us with dogs and donkeys?
I once found myself lying on the bed when the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came, faced the middle of the bed and started praying.
I disliked being in front of him, so I eased myself down towards the foot
of the bed until I had slipped out from under my bedcover."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: A person praying should push away someone who tries to pass in front
of him</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar pushed someone away while doing the <I>tashahhud</I> in the Ka'ba.
He said, "If he will not stop without your using force, then use force."
<P>
It is related that Abu Sa'id said that the Prophet said: [the next hadith].
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t36">487</A>. It is related that Abu Salih as-Samman said,
"I saw Abu Sa'id al-Khudri praying on the day of <I>Jumu'a </I>towards something
which was acting as <I>sutra</I> for him. A young man from the Banu Mu'ayt
wanted to pass directly in front of him. Abu Sa'id pushed him in the chest.
The young man looked round but saw no other way to go except in front of
him. So he tried to pass again and Abu Sa'id pushed him harder than the first
time. So he insulted Abu Sa'id and then went to Marwan and complained to
him about what Abu Sa'id had done to him. Abu Sa'id came in behind him into
the presence of Marwan who said, 'Abu Sa'id, what is this going on between
you and your nephew?' He said, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, say, "When one of you is praying towards something using
it as a <I>sutra</I> and someone tries to pass directly in front of him,
he should push him away. If he persists, use force for he is nothing but
a shaytan."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The wrong action of someone who passes in front of somebody else
praying</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t37">488</A>. It is related from Busr ibn Sa'id that Zayd
ibn Khalid sent him to Abu Juhaym to ask him what he had heard from the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about someone passing
in front of somebody else praying. Abu Juhaym said that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said, "If the person
passing in front of a man praying knew what he was incurring, he would find
it preferable to wait forty rather than pass in front of him."
<P>
Abu'n-Nadr said, "I do not know whether he said forty days, months or years."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: A man facing his companion or someone else in his prayer while he
is performing the prayer</B>
<P>
'Uthman disliked facing another man when he was praying if that distracted
him. However, if he is not distracted by it, Zayd ibn Thabit said, "It does
not matter. The man does not invalidate the other man's prayer."
<P>
489. It is related from 'A'isha that things which invalidate the prayer were
mentioned in her presence. They said, "It is invalidated by dogs, donkeys
and women." She said, "You have made us into dogs. I saw the Prophet, peace
be upon him, praying with me between him and the <I>qibla</I> lying on the
bed. I needed something and I disliked being in front of him, so I slipped
away."
<P>
Something similar is related from 'A'isha by a different <I>isnad</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Praying behind someone who is asleep</B>
<P>
490. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray when I was lying asleep on his bed When he
wanted to do the <I>witr</I>, he would wake me up and I would do the witr
as well."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Superogatory prayers behind a woman</B>
<P>
491. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "I used to
sleep in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, with my feet in his <I>qibla</I>. When he prostrated, he nudged me
and I pulled my legs up. When he stood up, I stretched them out again." She
said, "At that time, the houses did not have any lamps in them."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Someone who said, "Nothing invalidates the prayer."</B>
<P>
492. It is related that the things which invalidate the prayer were mentioned
in the presence of 'A'isha, and they were dogs, donkeys and women. She said,
"You have likened us to donkeys and dogs. By Allah, I saw the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, praying with me lying on the bed between
him and the <I>qibla</I>. I needed to relieve myself, and not wanting to
to sit up and annoy the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
I slipped out next to his feet."
<P>
493. It is related the nephew of Ibn Shihab said that he asked his uncle
about what invalidates the prayer and he said, "Nothing invalidates it. 'Urwa
ibn az-Zubayr reported to me that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to get up at night and pray with me in between
him and the <I>qibla</I> on the conjugal bed.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: A small girl being carried on the shoulders during the prayer</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t84">494</A>. It is related from Abu Qatada al-Ansari
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used
to pray carrying Umama, the daughter of Zaynab, the daughter of the Messenger
of Allah, and Abu'l-'As ibn Rabi'a ibn 'Abdu Shams. When he prostrated, he
put her down. When he stood up, he lifted her up again.
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Praying towards a bed with a menstruating woman in it</B>
<P>
495. It was related that Maymuna bint al-Harith said, "My bed was right next
to the place where the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prayed and sometimes his garment fell on me while I was on my bed."
<P>
496. It is related that Maymuna was heard to say, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to pray with me sleeping beside him.
When he prostrated, his garment touched me and I was menstruating."
<P>
Sulayman ash-Shaybani added, "and I was menstruating."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Is it permissable for a man to nudge his wife when going into
prostration so that he can prostrate properly?</B>
<P>
497. It is related from 'A'isha: see 486:&nbsp;first part plus, "When he
wanted to prostrate, he nudged my legs and I pulled them up."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: A woman removing something harmful from a person praying</B>
<P>
498. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "Once while the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing in prayer at the Ka'ba,
there was a group of Quraysh sitting there and one of them said, 'Do you
not see this show-off? Which of you will go to so and so's butchered camel,
get hold of its innards, bring them and then, when he prostrates, put them
on his back?' The most wretched of them did it and when the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prostrated, he put them on
his back. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
remained in prostration and they laughed until they fell over one another
laughing. Someone went to Fatima, peace be upon her, who was a young girl
at the time. She came running. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, remained in prostration until she removed it from him. Then she
turned to them and cursed them. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, finished the prayer, he said, 'O Allah! Punish Quraysh!
O Allah, punish Quraysh! O Allah, punish Quraysh!' Then he named them: 'O
Allah, punish 'Amr ibn Hisham, 'Utba ibn Rabi'a, Shayba ibn Rabi'a, al-Walid
ibn 'Utba, Umayya ibn Khalaf, 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt, and 'Umara ibn al-Walid.'"
<P>
'Abdullah said, "By Allah, I saw them all lying dead on the day of Badr and
then they were dragged into the well of Badr and then the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The people of the well have
been pursued by the curse.'"

<P>
Allah's words, <I>"The prayer is prescribed for the believers at set times"</I>
(4:103) meaning He appointed times for them.
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#1">499</A>. It is related from Ibn Shihab that one day
'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz delayed the prayer. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr went to him
and told him that one day in Iraq al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba had delayed the prayer
and Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari had gone to him and said, "What is this, Mughira?
Do you not know that Jibril descended and prayed and the Messenger of Allah.
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed. Then he prayed again and
the Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed.
Then he prayed again and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, prayed. Then he prayed again and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed. Then he prayed again and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed.
Then he said, 'I was commanded to do this.'" 'Umar said to 'Urwa, "Know what
you are relating. Did Jibril definitely lead the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, at the time of the prayer?" 'Urwa replied,
"This is what Bashir ibn Abi Mas'ud related from his father." 'Urwa said,
"'A'isha related to me that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray <I>'Asr</I>while the sunlight was pouring into
her room, before the sun itself had become visible (i.e. because it was still
high in the sky)."
<P>
<P>
<B>I:<I> "Turning in repentance towards Him. Show fear of Him and establish
the prayer. Do not be among the idolaters." </I>(30:31)</B>
<P>
500. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays came
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,
'We are from a particular branch of Rabi'a and we can only get to you during
the sacred months. Enjoin something on us so that we can take it from you
and summon to it those we left behind.' He said, 'I enjoin on you four things
and I forbid you four. Belief in Allah (which he explained to them was the
testimony that there is no god but Allah and that he was the Messenger of
Allah), the establishment of the prayer, the payment of <I>zakat</I> and
the submission to me of a fifth of any booty you take. I forbid you<I> dubba',
hantam, muqayyar</I> and <I>naqir</I> [different kinds of containers used
for making wine].'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The pledge of allegiance on the basis of establishing the prayer</B>
<P>
501. It is related that Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I pledged my allegiance
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the
basis of establishing the prayer, paying <I>zakat</I> and giving good counsel
to every Muslim."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Prayer is expiation</B>
<P>
502. It is related that Hudhayfa was heard to say, "We were sitting with
'Umar who said, 'Does anyone amongst you remember what the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said about trial and tribulation
(<I>fitna</I>)?' I spoke up, 'I do, exactly as he said it.' He asked, 'You
are bold enough for it.' I said, 'The trial (<I>fitna</I>) of a man in respect
of his wife, wealth, children and neighbours is expiated by prayer, fasting,
<I>sadaqa</I>, and by commanding what is right and forbidding what is wrong.'
He said, 'That is not what I meant, but rather the tribulation which spreads
like the waves of the sea.' Hudhayfa said, 'You have nothing to fear from
it, Amir al-Mu'minin! There is a closed door between you and it.' He said,
'Will it be broken down or opened?' Hudhayfa replied, 'It will be broken
down.' He said, 'Then it will never be closed again.' We said, 'Did 'Umar
know what the door was?' Hudhayfa said, 'Yes, as surely as night follows
day. I related to him a <I>hadith</I> without any mistakes in it."
<P>
Shaqiq said, "We were afraid to ask Hudhayfa and told Masruq and he asked
him. Hudhayfa said, "The door was 'Umar."
<P>
503. It is related from Ibn Mas'ud that a man received a kiss from a woman
and went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told
him about it. Allah sent down, <I>"Perform the prayer at the ends of the
days and the early part of the night. Good actions remove bad actions."</I>
(11:114) The man asked, "Messenger of Allah, is this for me?" He said, "It
is for every single one of my community."
<P>
[The man was Abu'l-Yasar Ka'b ibn 'Amr al-Ansari.]
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The excellence of doing the prayer at its proper time</B>
<P>
504. It is related that Abu 'Amr ash-Shaybani said, "The owner of this house
(and he indicated the house of 'Abdullah) said, 'I asked the Prophet what
action was most loved by Allah and he said, "The prayer at its proper time."'
" 'Abdullah asked, "Then what?" He said, "Then devotion to parents." He said,
"Then what?" He said, "Jihad in the way of Allah."
<P>
He said, "He related them to me and if I had asked for more, he would have
told me more."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The five prayers are expiation</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t94">505</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that he heard
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "What
do you think would happen if there was a river by someone's door in which
he washed five times every day? Do you think that any dirt would remain on
him?" They said, "Not a scrap of dirt would remain on him." He said, "That
is a metaphor of the five prayers by which Allah wipes out wrong actions."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Delaying the prayer beyond its proper time </B>
<P>
506. It is related that Anas said, "I do not perceive anything of what went
on in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
It was said, "What about the prayer!" He said, "Have you not done to the
prayer what you have done to it?"
<P>
507. It is related that az-Zuhri was heard to say, "I came to Anas ibn Malik
in Damascus and he was weeping. I said, 'Why are you weeping?' He said, 'I
do not perceive anything of what I knew except for this prayer, and even
it has been delayed.'"
<P>
Something like it is related from 'Uthman ibn Abi Rawwad.
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The person praying is in close conversation with his Lord, the Mighty
and Exalted.</B>
<P>
508. It is related that Anas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "When one of you prays, he is in close conversation
with his Lord, so he should not spit to his right, but under his left foot."
<P>
Qatada said, "He should not spit in front of him or ahead, but to his left
or under his feet."
<P>
Shu'ba said, "He should not spit in front of him or to his right, but to
his left or under his foot."
<P>
It is related that Anas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "He should not spit towards the qibla or to his right, but
to his left or under his foot."
<P>
509. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Be correct in the prostration and do not spread your forearms
like a dog does. When someone spits, he should not spit in front of him or
to his right. He is in close conversation with his Lord."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Waiting until it is cooler to pray <I>Dhuhr</I> when it is very
hot</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#29">510</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra and 'Abdullah
ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, "'Scorching heat is from the blast of Jahannam. So, when the
heat is fierce, delay the prayer until it gets cooler.'"
<P>
511. It is related that Abu Dharr said, "The <I>mu'adhdhin</I> of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called <I>Dhuhr</I> and the Prophet
said, 'Let it get cooler. Let it get cooler,' or he said, 'Wait, wait.' He
said, 'Intense heat is from the blast of Jahannam. When it is very hot, delay
the prayer until it gets cooler and we can see the shadows of the hills.'"
<P>
<A HREF="bukhari6.html#28">512</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the heat is
fierce, delay the prayer until it gets cooler, for scorching heat is from
the blast of Jahannam." The Fire complained to its Lord, 'O Lord, part of
me consumes the other part.' So He gave it permission to breathe out twice
- one breath in the winter and one in the summer. The breath in the summer
is the most intense heat you feel and the breath in the winter, the most
intense cold you feel."
<P>
513. It is related from Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said: "Wait until it is cooler for
<I>Dhuhr</I>. Intense heat is from the blast of Jahannam."
<P>
Sufyan, Yahya and Abu 'Awana corroborated it from al-A'mash.
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Delaying <I>Dhuhr</I> until it gets cooler when on a journey</B>
<P>
514. It is related that Abu Dharr al-Ghiffari said, "We were with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and the
mu'<I>adhdhin</I> wanted to call the <I>adhan</I> for <I>Dhuhr</I> but the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Let it get cooler.'
Then he once more wanted to call the <I>adhan</I> but he said to him, 'Let
it get cooler until we can see the shadows of the hills.' The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Intense heat is from the blast
of Jahannam. When it is very hot, delay the prayer until it gets cooler.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The time of <I>Dhuhr</I> is when the sun begins to decline</B>
<P>
Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
pray at midday."
<P>
515. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went out when the sun began to decline and
prayed <I>Dhuhr</I>. Then he stood on the minbar and spoke of the Final Hour
and said that there would be momentous things in it. Then he said, "Whoever
wants to ask about something should do so. I will tell you about anything
you ask me as long as I am in this place." Most of the people began to weep
and he repeated several times, "Ask me." 'Abdullah ibn Hudhafa as-Sahmi stood
up and asked, "Who is my father?" He said, "Your father is Hudhafa." Then
he again repeated several times, "Ask me." Then 'Umar knelt and said, "We
are pleased with Allah as a Lord, with Islam as a deen and with Muhammad
as a Prophet." He was silent and then said, "The Garden and the Fire were
displayed before me just now against this wall and I have never seen such
good and such evil."
<P>
516. It is related from Abu Barza, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray <I>Subh</I> when it was possible for someone
to recognise the person sitting next to him. In it he would recite between
sixty and a hundred <I>ayats</I>. He would pray <I>Dhuhr</I> when the sun
began to decline and <I>'Asr </I>at a time when it would still be possible
to go to the furthest part of Madina and back with the sun still white."
Abu'l-Minhal said, "I forgot what he said about <I>Maghrib</I>." "He did
not mind delaying<I> 'Isha' </I>until one third of the night had passed."
Then he said, "Until half of the night had passed."
<P>
Shu'ba said, "I met him one time and he said, 'Or a third of the night.'"
<P>

with water dripping from his head - and, placing his hand on his head, he
said, "If it were not hard for my community, I would have commanded them
to pray it at this time."' I asked 'Ata' to confirm how the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had placed his hand on his head as he
had been told by Ibn 'Abbas. 'Ata' separated his fingers slightly for me
and then placed the tips of his fingers on the side of his head with his
thumb touching the top of his ear by his face between the temple and the

him peace, said, "Anyone who forgets a prayer should pray it when he remembers
it and that is the only expiation he has to do for it.<I> 'Establish the
prayer for My remembrance.'</I>"
<P>
Anas related something like it from the Prophet (by a different
<I>isnad</I>.)
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: Making up prayers is done in order</B>
<P>
573. It is related that Jabir said, "On the Day of the Ditch, 'Umar began
to curse their unbelievers and said, 'I was about to pray <I>'Asr </I>when
the sun set. We went down to Buthan and prayed after the sun had set and
then played <I>Maghrib</I>."

<P>
574.It is related that Abu'l-Minhal said, "I went to Abu Barza al-Aslami

See 516, but without "...which you call <I>al-'Atama</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: Talking about <I>fiqh</I> and other excellent things during the

<P>
575. It is related that Qurra ibn Khalid said, "We waited for al-Hasan and
he was late coming to us until it was near to the time he usually got up.
Then he came and said, 'Some neighbours of ours invited us.' Then he said,
'Anas said, "One night we waited for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, until it was half-way through the night. He came and led
the prayer and then addressed us saying, 'Most people have prayed and then
gone to sleep but you were in prayer the whole time you were waiting for
the prayer.'"' Al-Hasan said, 'People are continuously in good action the
whole time they are waiting to do a good action.'"
<P>
Qurra said that that was part of the hadith of Anas from the Prophet.
<P>
576. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "Towards the end of his
life the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed the <I>'Isha'
</I>prayer and when he had said the salam, the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, stood up and said, 'Do you see this night? No one on
the surface of the earth today will still be there in a hundred years from
now.' The people misunderstood what the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon
him, had said so that they began to invent tales about what would be happening
in a hundred years time. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'No one on the surface of the earth today will still be there,' meaning
by that that generation would have passed away."

<P>
<B>XL: Night-talk with the family and guests </B>
<P>
577. It is related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr that the People of the
<I>Suffa</I> were poor people and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Whoever has food for two should invite a third. If he has
enough for four, he should invite a fifth or a sixth.' Abu Bakr took three
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took ten. There
was me and my father and mother (The narrator said, "I do not know if he
said, 'My wife and our servant who was shared between us and Abu Bakr's house.')
Abu Bakr went to eat with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and stayed until <I>'Isha' </I>was prayed and then went back again
and stayed until the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
eaten. Then Abu Bakr came after as much of the night had passed as Allah
willed and his wife said to him, 'What kept you from your guests?' - or she
said, 'your guest.' He said, 'Haven't you given them their meal?' She said,
'They refused until you came. They were offered food and they refused.' I
went away and hid. Abu Bakr called out, 'O Ghunthar!' and derided me and
abused me. Then he said, 'Eat and may you have no welcome,' adding, 'By Allah,
I will never eat it!' By Allah, with every mouthful of it we took, more appeared
underneath - until they were full and there was more food than there had
been before. Abu Bakr looked at it and there was as much as there had been
or more and he said to his wife, 'Sister of the Banu Firas! What is this?'
She said, 'No, apple of my eye, there is now three times as much as there
was before.' So Abu Bakr ate from it and said, 'That was from Shaytan,' meaning
his oath. Then he ate a mouthful of it and took the dish to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it remained with him until the
morning. There had been a treaty between us and some people and it had come
to an end, so he divided us up into twelve men, each of whom had a group
with him - only Allah knows how many there were with each man - and everyone
of them ate from it." Or as he said.
