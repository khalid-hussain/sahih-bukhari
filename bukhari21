<P>
<B>I: What has come about the claimant producing clear proof</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"O you who believe! When you take on a debt
for a specified period, write it down. A writer should write it down between
you justly. No writer should refuse to write; as Allah has taught him, so
he should write. The one incurring the debt should dictate and should fear
Allah his Lord and not reduce it in any way. If the person incurring the
debt is incompetent or weak or unable to dictate, then his guardian should
dictate for him justly. Two men among you should act as witnesses. But if
there are not two men, then a man and two women with whom you are satisfied
as witnesses; then if one of them forgets, the other can remind her. Witnesses
should not refuse when they are called upon. Do not think it too trivial
to write down, whether small or large, with the date that it falls due. Doing
that is juster in Allah's sight and more helpful when bearing witness and
more likely to eliminate any doubt &#150; unless it is an immediate transaction
hand to hand, taken and given without delay. There is nothing wrong in your
not writing that down. Call witnesses when you trade. Neither writer nor
witness should be put under pressure. If you do that, it is degeneracy on
your part. Show fear of Allah and Allah will give you knowledge. Allah has
knowledge of all things." </I>(2:282)
<P>
And the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"O you who believe! Be upholders of justice,
bearing witness for Allah alone, even against yourselves or your parents
and relatives. Whether they are rich or poor, Allah is well able to look
after them. Do not follow your own desires and deviate from the truth. If
you twist or turn away, Allah is aware of everything you do." </I>(4:135)
<P>
<P>
<B>II: When a man claims that another is just and says, "We only know good
of him," or says "I only know good of him."</B>
<P>
2492. It is related from 'Urwa, Ibn al-Musayyab, 'Alqama ibn Waqqas and
'Ubaydullah about the story of 'A'isha - and some of their report confirms
other parts - when the people of the lie spoke against her, and, when the
revelation was delayed, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, summoned 'Ali and Usama to consult them about divorcing his wife.
Usama said, "Keep your wife. We know only good about her." Barira said, "I
have not seen her do anything for which I could criticise her beyond the
fact that she is a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's leaven
so that the sheep comes and eats it." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Who will help us against a man whose injury
in the people of my house has reached me? By Allah, I only know good of my
wife. They mentioned a man about whom I only know good."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The testimony of the eavesdropper</B>
<P>
'Amr ibn Hurayth allowed it and said, "That is how one behaves with a iniquitous
liar."
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi, Ibn Sirin, 'Ata' and Qatada said, "Hearing is testimony."
<P>
Al-Hasan would say, "They did not make me a witness to anything, but I heard
such-and-such."
<P>
2493. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and Ubayy ibn Abi Ka'b al-Ansari went out,
making for the palm grove where Ibn Sayyad was located. When the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went in, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to conceal himself
behind some palm trunks, trying to hear something from Ibn Sayyad before
he saw him. He was lying down on his bed in a sheet of his murmuring. Ibn
Sayyad's mother saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, concealing himself among the palm trunks and she said to Ibn Sayyad,
'Saf! This is Muhammad.' So Ibn Sayyad stopped. The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If she had left him, it would
have become clear.'"
<P>
2494. It is related from 'A'isha that the wife of Rifa'a al-Qurazi came to
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "I was the
wife of Rifa'a and he divorced me and it was a final divorce. I married
'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn az-Zubayr, but he is like the frayed end of cloth [i.e.
impotent]. He said, "Do you want to return to Rifa'a? No, not until you have
enjoyed his sweetness and he has enjoyed your sweetness." Abu Bakr was sitting
with him while Khalid ibn Sa'd ibn al-'As was waiting at the door to be given
permission to enter. He said, "Abu Bakr! Do you hear what this woman says
openly in the presence of the Prophet?"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: When a witness or witnesses testify to something and other people
say, "We do not know that," judgement is given according to what was said
by the one who testified.</B>
<P>
Al-Humaydi said, "This is as Bilal reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, prayed in the Ka'ba when al-Fadl said, "'He did
not pray.' People accepted Bilal's testimony."
<P>
Similarly if two witnesses testify that so-and-so owes so-and-so a thousand
dirhams, and two others testify that it is one thousand five hundred, the
higher amount is adjudged to be correct.
<P>
2497. 'Abdullah ibn Abi Mulayka narrated that 'Uqba ibn al-Harith married
a daughter of Abu Ihab ibn 'Aziz. Later a woman came to him and stated, "I
nursed both 'Uqba and the woman he married." 'Uqba said to her, "I did not
know that you nursed me and you did not tell me." So he sent to the family
of Abu Ihab to ask them and they said, "We do not know that she suckled our
girl." He travelled to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, in Madina and asked him and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "How can you keep her when that has
been said?" So 'Uqba separated from her and she married another man.
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Upright witnesses</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Call two upright men from among yourselves
as witnesses," </I>(65:2), and <I>"with whom you are satisfied as witnesses."
</I>(2:282)
<P>
2498. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab was heard to say, "Some people
were dealt with by the revelation in the time of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The revelation has ceased. Now we
deal with you according to what is clear to us from your actions. If anyone
shows us good, we trust him and honour him. We know nothing of his inward.
Allah will call him to reckoning in respect of his inward. If anyone shows
us evil, we do not trust him and do not believe him, even if he says that
his inward is good."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: How many witnesses enable someone to be considered upright?</B>
<P>
2499. It is related that Anas said, "A funeral procession passed by and they
were praising the dead man. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'It is mandatory.' Then another passed and they were speaking
ill of the dead man - or he said, something else. He said, 'It is mandatory.'
It was asked, 'Messenger of Allah, why did you say it is mandatory for this
one and mandatory for that one?' He said, 'The testimony of the people [is
accepted]. The believers are the witnesses of Allah on the earth.'"
<P>
2500. It is related that Abu'l-Aswad said, "I came to Madina during an epidemic
and people were dying quickly. I was sitting with 'Umar ibn al-Khattab when
a funeral passed by and the dead man was praised. 'Umar said, 'It is mandatory.'
Then another passed by and they praised the dead. 'Umar said, 'It is mandatory.'
Then a third passed by and they spoke ill of the dead. 'Umar said, 'It is
mandatory.' I said, 'What is mandatory, Amir al-Mu'minin?' He said, 'I say
what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Any Muslim
to whose goodness four people testify will be admitted by Allah to the Garden."
We asked, "And if three do?" He said, "Three as well." We asked, "And two?"
He said, "Two also." Then we did not ask him about one.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Testimony about lineage and known suckling when death happened in
the past</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Thuwayba suckled
me and Abu Salama."
<P>
<B>Establishing the truth of that</B>
<P>
2501. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Aflah asked for permission to visit
me and I did not give him permission. He said, 'Do you veil yourself from
me when I am your uncle?' I asked, 'How is that?' He said, 'My brother's
wife suckled you with the milk of my brother.'" She said, "I asked the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about that and he said,
'Aflah spoke the truth. So give him permission.'"
<P>
2502. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said about Hamza's daughter, "She is not lawful
for me. What is unlawful by suckling is unlawful by lineage. She is my brother's
daughter by suckling."
<P>
<A HREF="bukhari21.html#r1">2503</A>. It is related from 'Amra bint 'Abdu'r-Rahman that
'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, informed her that while the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was with her she heard the
sound of a man asking permission to enter the house of Hafsa. 'A'isha said,
"I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I think it is so-and-so.' Hafsa's uncle by
suckling." 'A'isha said, "Messenger of Allah, this man is asking permission
to enter your house." She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'I think it is so-and-so,' the uncle of Hafsa
by suckling." 'A'isha asked, "If so-and-and (her uncle by suckling) has been
alive, could he have visited me?" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Yes, suckling make unlawful what birth makes
unlawful."
<P>
2504. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came to me while a man was with me. He asked ''A'isha,
who is this?' I said, 'My brother by suckling.' He said, ''A'isha, look into
your brothers. Suckling is from hunger [i.e. for infants]."
<P>
Ibn Mahdi corroborated it from Sufyan.
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The testimony of a slanderer, a thief and a fornicator</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Never again accept them as witnesses. Such
people are the degenerate &#150; except for those who after that repent.</I>"
(24:4-5)
<P>
'Umar flogged Abu Bakra, Shibl ibn Ma'bad and Nafi' for slandering al-Mughira
and then he told them to repent, saying, "Whoever repents, I will accept
his testimony."
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Uqba, 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, Sa'id ibn Jubayr, Tawus, Mujahid,
ash-Sha'bi, 'Ikrima, az-Zuhri, Muharib ibn Dithar and Mu'awiya ibn Qurra
allowed it [i.e. accepting the testimony of someone who has received a
<I>hadd</I> punishment after he has repented.]
<P>
Abu'z-Zinad said, "The business with us in Madina is that if a slanderer
retracts what he said and asks forgiveness of his Lord, then his testimony
is accepted."
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi and Qatada said, "If he says that he lied, he is flogged and his
testimony accepted."
<P>
Ath-Thawri said, "If the slave is flogged and then set free, his testimony
is permitted. If someone who had a <I>hadd</I> judgement against them is
made a qadi, his judgements are permitted."
<P>
Someone [i.e. Abu Hanifa] said, "The testimony of a slanderer is not permitted,
even if he repents. Then he said, "A marriage is not permitted without two
witnesses. A marriage witnessed by two people who have had <I>hadd</I> judgements
against them is permitted. If someone is married by the testimony of two
slaves, it is not permitted. " He allows the testimony of the one who has
had a hadd judgement against him, the slave, and the slavegirl about the
sighting of the new moon of Ramadan.
<P>
<B>How one's repentance is recognised.</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, exiled the fornicator
for a year. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade
speaking to Ka'b ibn Malik and his two companions until fifty nights had
passed.
<P>
2505. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr narrated that a woman stole during the expedition
of the Conquest of Makka and she was brought to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, who commanded that her hand be cut off.
'A'isha said, "She repented truly and then married. She used to come after
that and I would present her needs to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace."
<P>
[The woman was Fatima bint al-Aswad.]
<P>
2506. It is related from Zayd ibn Khalid that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, e commanded that the one who committed
fornication and had not been married should receive a hundred lashes and
be exiled for a year.
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: One should not bear witness to an injustice if called upon to do so</B>
<P>
2507. It is related that an-Nu'man ibn Bashir said, "My mother ashed my father
to give me a gift from his property and then. after hesitating. he gave it
to me. She said, 'I will not be content until you have the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, as a witness. So he took my hand while I was
boy, and brought me to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
He said, 'His mother is the daughter of Rawaha and she asked me to give this
boy a gift.' He asked, 'Do you have other sons?' He said, 'Yes.' I think
that he said, 'Do not call on me to witness an injustice.'"
<P>
Abu Hariz reported from ash-Sha'bi, "I will not be a witness to an injustice."
<P>
2508. It is related that 'Imran ibn al-Husayn was heard to say that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;said, "The best of you are
my generation and then those who follow them and then those who follow them."
'Imran said, "I do not know whether the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said it twice or three times." "Then after them will come
a people who betray and are not trustworthy, who testify when they are not
asked to testify, and who make a vow and do not fulfill it. Fleshiness will
appear among them."
<P>
2509. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The best of people are my generation and then
those who follow them and then those who follow them. Then there will come
people whose testimony will precede their oaths and whose oaths will precede
their testimony."
<P>
Ibrahim said, "They used to beat us for rushing to swear and take oaths."
<P>
[This was in order that it did not become a habit for them.]
<P>
<P>
<B>X: What is said about false testimony</B>
<P>
The words of Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, <I>"Those who do not bear false
witness." </I>(25:72)
<P>
<B>Regarding Concealing testimony</B>
<P>
<I>"Do not conceal testimony. If someone does conceal it, his heart commits
a crime. Allah knows everything you do." </I>(2:282) <I>"If you twist"
</I>(4:135) your tongues with testimony.
<P>
2510. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was asked about the greatest of wrong actions,'
and he said, 'Associating with Allah, disobedience to parents, murder and
false witness."
<P>
2511. It is related from the father of Abu Bakra that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Shall I inform you of the
greatest of wrong actions?" They replied, "Please do, Messenger of Allah!'
He said, "Associating with Allah, disobedience to parents." He had been reclining
and now sat up and said, 'And false witness.' He continued to repeat it until
we said, 'I wish he would be quiet.'"
<P>
Another <I>isnad</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The testimony of a blind person, his business, his marriage and giving
in marriage, his buying and selling, his accepting him for calling the
<I>adhan</I> and other things, and what is recognised by means of voices</B>
<P>
Qasim, al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, az-Zuhri and 'Ata' allowed his testimony.
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi said, "His testimony is allowed if he is intelligent."
<P>
Al-Hakam said, "It is permitted in many things."
<P>
Az-Zuhri said, "If Ibn 'Abbas were to give testimony, do you think that you
would reject it?"
<P>
[Ibn 'Abbas went blind whenhe was old.]
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas would sent a man to see when the sun set in order to break his
fast. He would ask about dawn and if he was told that dawn had risen, he
would pray two <I>rak'ats</I>.
<P>
Sulayman ibn Yasar said, "I asked permission to visit 'A'isha and she recognised
my voice and said, 'Sulayman, enter. You are still a slave while you still
owe something [of your price.]"
<P>
Samura ibn Jundub allowed the testimony of a veiled woman.
<P>
2512. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, heard a man reciting in the mosque and said, 'May Allah
have mercy on him! He has reminded me of such-and-such a verse which we forgot
in such-and-such a <I>sura</I>.'"
<P>
'Abbad ibn 'Abdullah reported from 'A'isha, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, did <I>tajahhud</I> prayers in my house and he heard
the voice of 'Abbad praying in the mosque. He asked, ''A'isha, is this the
voice of 'Abbad?' 'Yes,' I replied. He said, 'O Allah, have mercy on 'Abbad!'"
<P>
2513. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Bilal calls the <I>adhan</I>
during the night, so eat and drink until the <I>adhan</I> is called - or
he said "until you hear the <I>adhan</I> of Ibn Umm Maktum." Ibn Umm Maktum
was a blind man who did not call the <I>adhan</I> until people tol dhim,
'The morning has come.'"
<P>
2514. It is related that al-Miswar ibn Makhrama said, "Some cloaks came to
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and my father Makhrama
said to me, 'Let us go to him. Perhaps he will give us one of them.' My father
stood at the door and spoke. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, recognised his voice and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, came out with a cloak whose beauties he was displaying. He said,
'I kept this for you. I kept this for you.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Women's testimony</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"And if there are not two men, then a man
and two men." </I>(2:282)
<P>
2515. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Is not the testimony of the woman half
of the testimony of the man?" The women replied, "Yes." He said, "That is
due to the deficiency of her intellect."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: The testimony of slavegirls and slaves</B>
<P>
Anas said, "The testimony of the slave is permitted if he is just." Shurayh
and Zurara ibn Awfa allowed it. Ibn Sirin said, "His testimony is permitted,
except in the case of a slave testifying on behalf of his master." Al-Hasan
and Ibrahim allowed it in something insignificant. Shurayh said, "All of
you are sons of slaves and slavewomen."
<P>
2516. Ibn Abi Mulayka was heard to relate, "'Uqba ibn al-Harith related to
me - or I heard from him - that he married Umm Yahya bint Abi Ihab. He said,
"A black slavewoman came and said, 'I nursed both of you." I mentioned that
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he
turned away from me.' He said, 'I went to the side and mentioned that to
him. He asked, "How can you keep her when she states that she nursed both
of you?"' So he forbade him to remain with her."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: The testimony of wet-nurses</B>
<P>
2517. It is related that 'Uqba ibn al-Harith said, "I married a woman and
then a woman came and said, 'I nursed both of you.' I went to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he asked, 'How can you keep
her with what has been said? Leave her,' or words to that effect."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Women attesting to the good character of other women</B>
<P>
2518. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, about when the
people of the Lie said what they said about her and she was exonerated of
it. (Az-Zuhri said that all of a group related some of her hadith and some
remembered more than others and confirmed its exact transmission. I memorised
from each of them the <I>hadith</I> which was related to me from 'A'isha
and part of the <I>hadith</I> verifies other parts. They claim that 'A'isha
said,) "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
wanted to go on a journey, he drew lots between his wives and he took with
him whoever had her lot drawn. Lots were drawn between us for an expedition
which he went on and my lot came out, so I went out with him. It was after
the veil has been revealed. I was carried in a howdah and was brought down
in it. We travelled until the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, finished that expedition and returned and we drew near to
Madina. The announcement was made at night to travel. I got up when they
announced travel and walked until I had gone past the army. When I finished
my need, I went to the camp to leave and then I touched my chest and my necklace
made of onyx had broken. I went back to look for my necklace and looked for
it delayed me. Those who were carrying me came and picked my howdah and put
it on my camel which I was riding. They thought that I was in it. At that
time women were light and not heavy and did not have a lot of flesh on them.
They used to eat only a little.So the people did not notice the difference
in the weight of the howdah when they lifted it up as I was a young girl.
They made the camel move and set off.
<P>
"I found my necklace after the army had left. I came to their site and there
was no one there. I went to the place where I had been, thinking that they
would miss me and return for me. While I was sitting there, drowziness overcame
me and I fell asleep. Safwan ibn a-Mu'attal as-Sulami, then adh-Dhakwani,
was behind the army and he reached my spot in the morning. He saw the dark
form of someone asleep, so he came to me. He had seen me before the veil.
I woke up when he said, 'We belong to Allah and to Him we return!' Then he
made his camel kneel and he put its leg down and I mounted it. He went leading
the camel until we reached the army after they had alighted to camp at the
height of midday. Then whoever was destroyed was destroyed. The one who led
the lie was 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul.
<P>
"We reached Madina and I was ill there for a month while they were spreading
the talk of the people of the lie. I imagined in my illness that I did not
see from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, the kindness
which I used to see him show when I was ill. He would enter and give the
greeting and then ask, 'How is the girl?'
<P>
"I was not aware of any of that until I recovered and I went out with Umm
Mistah to al-Manasi'. We used to go the lavatory there and we only went out
to it from night to night. That was before we put up lavatories near our
houses. We followed the custom of the Arabs at first in the desert, or in
open land. So Umm Mistah bint Abi Ruhm and I went out walking. She tripped
on her dress and said, 'May Mistah stumble!' I said to her, 'What you have
said is bad. Would you curse a man who was present at Badr?' She said, 'O
you there! Have you not heard what they have said?' And she told be about
what the people of the Lie said. Then I became even more ill.
<P>
"When I returned to my house, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came and visited me and said, 'How is that one?' I said,
'Give me permission to go to my parents.'" She said, "At that time I wanted
to make sure of the report from them. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, gave me permission and I went to my parents. I asked
my mother, 'What are the people saying?' She said, 'O my daughter! Do not
make too much of the business. By Allah, seldom has there been a woman of
beauty with a husband who loves her with co-wives but that they talk against
her.' I said, 'Glory be to Allah! The people have been saying this?' I spent
the entire night until morning unable to stop weeping and could not sleep
at all.
<P>
"Then in the morning the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, summoned 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Usama ibn Zayd when the revelation
had been delayed to consult them about divorcing his wife. Usama pointed
out what he himself knew of their love and trust. Usama said, '"Keep your
wife. We know only good.' 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allah
has not constricted you and there are many women besides her. Ask the slavegirl
to tell you the truth.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, summoned Barira and said, 'Barira, have you seen anything in her
which would make you doubt her?' Barira said, 'I have not seen her do anything
for which I could criticise her beyond the fact that she is a young girl
who sleeps, neglecting her family's leaven so that the sheep comes and eats
it.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Who will help us against a man whose injury in the people my of house has
reached me? By Allah, I only know good of my wife. They mentioned a man about
whom I only know good who has not entered where my family is except with
me!'
<P>
"Sa'd ibn Mu'adh got up and said, 'Messenger of Allah, by Allah, we will
help you against him. If he is from Aws, we will chop his head off, and if
he is from our brothers of Khazraj, command us and we will carry out what
you command about him.' Sa'd ibn 'Ubada, the leader of Khazraj, got up, -
before then he had been a virtuous man, but tribal zeal had carried him away,
and said, 'You lied, by the life of Allah! You will not kill him and you
are not able to do that!' Usayd ibn al-Hudayr got up and said, 'You have
lied, by the life of Allah! By Allah, we will kill him! You are a hypocrite
arguing on behalf of hypocrites!' The two sides of Aws and Khazraj were stirred
up against one another until they were ready for war while the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on the minbar. He
came down and calmed them until they were silent and he was silent. That
day I could not stop weeping and I could not sleep.
<P>
"In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and
a day until I thought that weeping would split my liver. While they were
sitting with me while I was weeping, a woman of the Ansar asked for permission
to enter and I gave her permission. She sat down weeping with me. While we
were like that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, came in and sat down. He had not sat with me since before the day
when what was said about me was said. A month had passed without any revelation
coming to him regarding my business."
<P>
She said, "He said the <I>tashahhud</I> and then said, ''A'isha, such-and-such
about you has reached me. If you are innocent, then Allah will show you innocent.
If you have done anything, then ask forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him
in repentance. If the slave of Allah admits his sin and then repents, Allah
turns to him.' When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, finished what he was saying, my tears stopped so that I was not
aware of a single tear. I said to my father, 'Answer the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for me.' He said, 'By Allah, I do
not know what to say to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.' I said to my mother, 'Answer the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, for me regarding what he said.' She said,
'By Allah, I do not know what to say to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>
She said, "I was a young girl and did not recite much of the Qur'an, so I
said, 'By Allah, I know that you have heard what people are saying and it
has become fixed in yourself and you have believed it. If I were to say to
you that I am innocent - and Allah knows that I am innocent - you would not
believe me when I said that. If I were to confess to something to you - and
Allah knows that I am innocent - you would believe me. By Allah, I can find
no example for you and me except for that of the father of Yusuf when he
said, <I>"Steadfast patience is beautiful. It is Allah alone who is my Help
in face of the event that you describe."</I> Then I turned over on my bed,
hoping that Allah would proclaim me innocent. However, by Allah, I did not
think that any revelation would be sent down regarding me. I thought too
little of myself that something would be said in the Qur'an regarding me,
however I hoped that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, would have a dream in which Allah would exonerate me.
<P>
"By Allah, he did not get up from where he was sitting nor did any of the
people of the House leave before the revelation descended on him and he and
seized by the intense sweating which usually seized him and the sweat was
pouring from him like pearls of sweat although it was a wintry day. Then
it left the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he was smiling. The first word that he spoke was that he said to me,
''A'isha, praise Allah. Allah has exonerated you.' My mother said to me,
'Go the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' I said,
'No, by Allah! I will not go to him and I will only praise Allah.' Then Allah
Almighty revealed the verses, <I>'Those who propagated the lie are a band
of you. . .' </I>(24:11)
<P>
"When Allah sent down this to exonerate me, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, who used
to provide maintenance for Mistah ibn Uthatha because he was related to him,
said, 'By Allah, I will never provide anything for Mistah ever again after
what he said about 'A'isha!' Then Allah Almighty sent down, <I>'Those of
you possessing affluence and ample wealth should not make oaths that they
will not give to their relatives and the very poor and those who have emigrated
in the way of Allah. They should rather pardon and overlook. Would you not
love Allah to forgive you? Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.' </I>(24:22)
Abu Bakr said, 'Yes, by Allah, I want Allah to forgive me.' So he returned
to his past custom with Mistah."
<P>
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, also asked
Zaynab bint Jahsh about my business. He said, 'Zaynab, what do you know?
What have you seen?' She said, 'Messenger of Allah, I protect my hearing
and sight. By Allah, I only know good of her.'" 'A'isha said, "She was my
rival but Allah protected her by scrupulousness."
<P>
The like of it is related from Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: When one man attests to the good character of a man, that is enough</B>
<P>
Abu Jamila said, "I found a foundling. When 'Umar saw me, he said, 'Perhaps
the little cave may be filled with calamities,' as if he suspected me. My
chief said, 'He is a virtuous man.' He said, 'That is the case. Go and we
will provide [for the child].'"
<P>
2519. It is related that Abu Bakr said, "A man was mentioned in the presence
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'Bother
you! You have severed you companion's neck. You have severed your companion's
neck,' repeating that several times. Then he said, 'If one of you must praise
someone, he should say, "I think such and such, and Allah is enough for him.
I do not commend and praise anyone in front of Allah. but I think him to
be such-and-such," if he knows that of him.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: What is disliked of excessive praise, and one should say what he
knows</B>
<P>
2520. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, heard a man praising another man, and he went to excess
in praising him. He said, 'You have destroyed - or you have broken - the
man's back.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Children coming of age and their testimony</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Once your children have reached puberty,
they should ask your permission to enter."</I> (24:59)
<P>
Al-Mughira said, "I reached puberty when I was twelve."
<P>
Women reach puberty by menstruation by the words of Allah, the Mighty and
Majestic,<I> "In the case of those of your wives who are past the age of
menstruation ... The time for women who are pregnant is when they give birth."
</I>(65:4)
<P>
Al-Hasan ibn Salih said, "I met a woman neighbour of ours who was a grandmother
when she was twenty-one."
<P>
2521. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, turned him away on the day of Uhud when he was fourteen
and did not allow him (to participate). [He said,] "Then he summoned me on
the Day of the Ditch when I was fifteen and allowed me [to participate]."
Nafi' said, "I went before 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz when he was Khalif and
related this <I>hadith</I> to him. He said, 'This is the border between the
child and the adult.' He wrote to his governors to allocate a portion for
those who had reached fifteen.'"
<P>
2522. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Taking a <I>ghusl</I> on Friday is
obligatory for everyone who has reached puberty."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: The judge asking the claimant, "Do you have a clear proof?" before
the oath</B>
<P>
2523. It is related from 'Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears an oath in which
he lies in order to take the property of a Muslim by it, will meet Allah
with anger covering him." He said that al-Ash'ath ibn Qays said, "By Allah,
that was about me. There was some land that was between me and a Jewish man,
and he disavowed me, so I took him to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked
me, 'Do you have a clear proof?' I said, 'No.' He said to the Jew, 'Swear.'
I said, 'Messenger of Allah, then he will swear and take away my property.'
Then Allah Almighty revealed, <I>'Those who sell Allah's contract and their
own oaths for a paltry price, such people will have no portion in the Next
World ....' </I>(3:77)"
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: The oath should be taken by the one against whom the claim is made
regarding property and <I>hadd</I> punishments</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Either produce
your two witnesses or he takes an oath."
<P>
It is related from Ibn Shubrama, "Abu'z-Zinad spoke to me about the testimony
of the witness and the oath of the one again whom the claim is made. I said,
'Allah Almighty says, <I>"Two men among you should act as witnesses. But
if there are not two men, then a man and two women with whom you are satisfied
as witnesses; then if one of them forgets, the other can remind her."</I>
(2:282)' I said, 'If the testimony of one witness and the oath of the one
against whom the claim is made were enough, then there would be no need for
one to remind the other, so why would this one remind the other?"
<P>
2524. It is related that Ibn Abi Mulayka said, "Ibn 'Abbas wrote that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, decided that one against
whom the claim was made should take an oath."
<P>
2525. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "Whoever swears [falsely] by oath
that he deserves property, will meet Allah and He will be angry with him."
Then Allah Almighty revealed to confirm that, "<I>Those who sell Allah's
contract and their own oaths for a paltry price, such people will have no
portion in the Next World </I>...to..<I>a painful punishment.</I>"' (3:77)
Then al-Ash'ath ibn Qays came out to us and said, 'What has Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman
{i.e. 'Abdullah] related to you?' We told him. He said, 'He has spoken the
truth. This was sent down about me. There was a dispute between me and another
man about something. We took the dispute to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'Either produce your two witnesses or he takes
an oath.' I said, 'Then he will take an oath without caring.' The Prophet*,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Whoever swears by an oath
that he deserves soemthing and lies in his oath, will met Allah who will
be angry with him.'" Then Allah sent down the confirmation of that. Then
he recited this <I>ayat. </I>
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI. CHAPTER: When someone makes a claim about someone or slanders, he
can seek the proof and is allowed to seek out the proof</B>
<P>
2526. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that Hilal ibn Umayya accused his wife
of adultery with Sharik ibn Sahma' in the presence of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Produce clear proof or the <I>hadd</I> will be enforced
on your back.' He said, 'Messenger of Allah, if one of us were to see a man
on top of his wife, would he then go looking for the proof?' He continued
to say, 'The clear proof or the <I>hadd</I> will be enforced on your back.'"
He mentioned the <I>hadith</I> of the <I>li'an </I>divorce.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: The oath after<I> 'Asr</I></B>
<P>
2527. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace s aid, "There are three whom Allah will not
speak to or look at the Day of Rising and will not purify and who will have
a painful punishment: a man who had excess water on the road and withheld
it from travellers; a man who gave allegiance to an Imam and only gave allegiance
for this world, and when he is given some of it is pleased and is angry when
he is not given any of it; and a man who puts out his goods after <I>'Asr
</I>and says, 'By Allah, I have been offered such-and-such for them,' and
someone takes them."
<P>
<B>XXIII: The oath of the one against whom the claim is made when he is obliged
to take an oath, and he does not have to move from his place to another place
[to take it]</B>
<P>
Marwan decided that Zayd ibn Thabit should take an oath on the minbar and
he said, "I will swear it where I am," and Zayd began to take the oath and
refused to swear on the minbar. Marwan was surprised at him.
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Either produce
your two witnesses or he takes an oath," and he did not specify one place
rather than another.
<P>
2528. It is related from Ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears an oath in order to [wrongfully]
take the property of a Muslim by it, will meet Allah with Him anger with
him."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: When people race one another to take the oath</B>
<P>
2529. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, offered the oath to some people and they hurried, so
he commanded that lots be drawn between them about which would take the oath.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: The words of Allah Almighty, "<I>Those who sell Allah's contract
and their own oaths for a paltry price</I>." (3:77)</B>
<P>
2530. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa was heard to say, "A man
set up his goods and swore by Allah that he had been offered a sum for them
which he had not been offered and it was sent down, 'Those that sell the
faith that they owe Allah and their own plighted word for a small price.'"
Ibn Abi Qafa said, "The one who lies about the value is a treacherous person
who consumes usury."
<P>
2531. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet*, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears a false oath in order to take
the property of a man - or he said, his brother - by it, will meet Allah
while He is anger with him." Allah Almighty revealed to confirm that, "<I>Those
who sell Allah's contract and their own oaths for a paltry price, ...to..a
painful punishment."</I>' (3:77) Al-Ash'ath met me and asked, "What has 'Abdullah
related to you today?" I replied, "Such-and-such." He said, "It was sent
down about me."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: How one is asked to take an oath</B>
<P>
Allah Almighty says, <I>"They swear to you by Allah," </I>(9:62) and He,
the Mighty and Majestic, says, <I>"Then they come to you, swearing by Allah,
'We desired nothing but good and reconciliation."</I> (4:62)
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A man swore
a false oath by Allah after <I>'Asr</I>." One does not swear by other than
Allah.
<P>
2532. It is related that Talha ibn 'Ubaydullah was heard to say, "A man came
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and asked
him about about Islam. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'It is five prayers a day.' He asked, 'Do I have to do any
more?' He said, 'No, unless you want to do voluntary prayers. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then said, 'And you must
fast Ramadan.' He asked, 'Do I have to do any more?' He said, 'No, unless
you want to do so voluntarily.'"
<P>
He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
mentioned <I>zakat</I> to him. He asked, 'Do I have to do any more?' He replied,
'No, unless you want to do so voluntarily.' The man withdrew, saying, 'By
Allah, I will not do more than this nor less than this.' The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If he speaks the truth,
he will have success.' [i.e. he will be granted Paradise]"
<P>
2533. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears an oath, should swear by Allah
or be silent."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: The one who establishes the clear proof after the oath</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Perhaps one
of you will be more eloquent than another with his argument."
<P>
Tawus, Ibrahim and Shurayh said, "The just clear proof has more right than
the false oath."
<P>
<A HREF="muw13.html#1">2534</A>. It is related from Umm Salama that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Litigants come
to me and it may be that one of them are more eloquent with his argument
than the other and so I and give judgement on some of his brother's right
in his favour accordingly. Then I am cutting a piece of the Fire for him,
so he should not take it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: The one who commands that a promise be carried out</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said that and he mentioned Isma'il,<I> "He was true to his
promise."</I> (19:54) Ibn al-Ashwa' judged the promise &nbsp;should be carried
out and reported that from Samura ibn Jundub. Al-Miswar ibn Makhrama said,
"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,mention
one of his sons-in-law and say, 'He promised me this and fulfilled it.'"
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "I saw that Ishaq ibn Ibrahim used to use the
<I>hadith</I> of Ibn Ashwa' as a proof."
<P>
2535. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas reported that Abu Sufyan had
reported to him that Heraclius said to him, "I asked you what he commanded
and you stated that he commanded you to pray, speak truthfully, be chaste,
fulfil the promise and carry out the trust." Then he said, "This is the
description of a Prophet."
<P>
2536. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are three signs of a hypocrite:
whenever he speaks, he lies; whenever he is trusted, he betrays his trust;
and whenever he makes a promise, he breaks it."
<P>
2537. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "When the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, some money came to Abu Bakr from
al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami. Abu Bakr said, 'Whoever is owed a debt by the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, or had a promise from him should
come to us." Jabir said, "I said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, promised to give me such-and-such, such-and-such
and such-and-such,'" and he spread out his hands three times. Jabir said,
"He counted out in my hands five hundred and then five hundred and then five
hundred."
<P>
2538. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "A Jew from the people of
al-Hira asked me, 'Which of the two terms did Musa fulfil?' [indicated in
28:27]. I said, 'I do not know until I see the scholar of the Arabs and ask
him.' I went and asked Ibn 'Abbas. He said, 'He fulfilled the longer and
better of them. When a Messenger of Allah says something, he does it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: The people of the idolaters are not asked to give testimony and
the like</B>
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi said, "The testimony of the people of one religion against another
is not allowed by the words of Allah Almighty, <I>'So We stirred up enmity
and hatred between them ' </I>(5:14)"
<P>
Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, "Do not believe the People of the Book and do not say that they
are liars. Say, 'We believe in Allah and what has been sent down.'"
<P>
2539. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "O company of Muslims! How can
you ask the People of the Book when your book which was sent down on His
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is the most recent of the
reports by Allah. You recite and it has not been altered. Allah has reported
to you that the People of the Book have altered what Allah wrote and changed
the Book in their possession. They said, 'It is from Allah' in order to sell
it for a small price. Does not the knowledge that has come to you spare you
from asking them? No, by Allah, we have not seen a man among them asking
you about what was sent down on you!'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: Drawing lots in [the solving of] problems</B>
<P>
His words, <I>"When they cast their reeds to see which of them would be the
guardian of Maryam."</I> (3:44) Ibn 'Abbas said, "They drew lots [by throwing
their arrows in the river] and the arrows went with the stream, but Zakariyya's
arrow went against the flow, so Zakariyya was put in charge of looking after
her."
<P>
His word, <I>"fa-sahama" </I>means to agree to draw lots, <I>"and he was
among the condemned"</I> (37:141) means those who were defeated.
<P>
Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
offered the oath to some people and they raced to take it and he commanded
that lots be drawn between them to see who would take the oath."
<P>
2540. It is related that an-Nu'man ibn Bashir was heard to say that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The example of the one who
thinks little of the limits of Allah and falls into them is like like some
people who draw lots on a boat. Some of them get the lower part and some
of them the upper part. Those who in the lower part had to pass by the upper
to get water and they annoyed him. So he took an axe and began to make a
hole in the bottom of the ship. They came to him and said, 'What is the matter
with you?' He said, 'You annoyed me and I must have water.' If they take
hold of his hands to stop him, they will save him and all save themselves.
If they leave him, they will destroy him and they will destroy themselves."
<P>
2541. It is related from Kharija ibn Zayd al-Ansari that Umm al-'Ala', a
woman of the Ansar who gave her allegiance to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, reported to him that when the Muhajirun were allotted
lodging by drawing lots, the lot of lodging 'Uthman ibn Maz'un fell to them.
Umm al-'Ala' said, "'Uthman ibn Maz'un lodged with us. Then he became ill
and we nursed him until he died and we put him in his clothes. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to us and I said,
'The mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu's-Sa'ib. I testify to you that Allah
has honoured you.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said to me, 'How do you know that Allah has honoured him?' I said, 'I do
not know, may my father be your ransom, Messenger of Allah!' He said, 'As
for 'Uthman, by Allah, the Certain has come to him. I hope for the best for
him. By Allah, I do not know what He will do with him in spite of my being
the Messenger of Allah.' She said, 'By Allah, I will never vouch for anyone
after him.' That grieved me." She said, "I went to sleep and I dreamt I saw
'Uthman as a flowing spring. I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and told him and he said, 'That is his actions.'"
<P>
2542. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, wanted to travel, he would draw lots
between his wives, and he would travel with whichever wife had her lot drawn.
He used to give each woman her day and night although Sawda bint Zam'a gave
her day and night to 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, desiring by that to
please the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
2543. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "If people only knew what was
in the call to prayer and the first row, and could find no other way to get
it than drawing lots for it, they would draw lots for it. If they only knew
what was in the prayers o<I>f 'Isha'</I> and <I>Subh</I>, they would come
to them even if they had to crawl."

<B><BIG><A NAME="sulh">Chapter 58. Book of Reconciliation</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: What has come about reconciling people</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"There is no good in much of their secret
talk &#150; except in the case of those who enjoin sadaqa, or what is right,
or putting things right between people. If anyone does that, seeking the
pleasure of Allah, We will give him an immense reward." </I>(4:114)
<P>
<B>The ruler going out to places in order to reconcile people with their
companions</B>
<P>
2544. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd there was some disagreement between
some people of the Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, went to them with some people to make peace among them.
The time for the prayer came, but the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, had not yet returned. Bilal came and gave the <I>adhan</I> for
the prayer, but the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
still not come. He went to Abu Bakr and said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, has been detained and the time for the prayer has
come. Will you lead the prayer?" He replied, "Yes, if you wish." The
<I>iqama</I> for the prayer was given and Abu Bakr went forward [to lead
the prayer]. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, came walking through the rows until he was standing in the first row.
The people began to clap, until they did it a lot. Abu Bakr almost never
turned around in the prayer, but he turned around and saw the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, behind him. He, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, made a gesture to him with his hand, commanding him
to pray as he was doing. Abu Bakr raised his hands and praised Allah and
then fell back until he was in the row. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went forward and led the people in the prayer. When
he finished, he turned to the people and said, "O people, why is it that
when something happened to you in your prayer you started clapping? Clapping
is for women. If something happens during the prayer, you should say,
'<I>Subhanallah</I>.' Whoever hears it will turn around. Abu Bakr, what kept
you from leading the people in prayer when I commanded you?' Abu Bakr said,
'It is not for Ibn Abi Quhafa to pray in front of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>
2545. It is related that Anas was heard to say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was asked, 'If only you would go to 'Abdullah ibn
Ubayy!' So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to
him riding a donkey and the Muslims went walking with him across the salty
marsh. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to
him, he said, 'Keep away from me! By Allah, the stink of your donkey offends
me! A man of the Ansar among them said, 'By Allah, the donkey of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smells better than you!'
A man of 'Abdullah's people got angry on his behalf and abused him, and then
the companions of each of them got angry. They were striking one another
with sticks, hands and sandals. We heard that it was then revealed, '<I>If
two parties of the believers fight, make peace between them.'</I> (49:9)"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The one who reconciles people is not a liar</B>
<P>
2546. It is related that Umm Kulthum bint 'Uqba reported that she heard the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Someone
who puts things right between people and promotes good or says good cannot
be called a liar."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The ruler saying to his companions, "Let us go and bring about
reconciliation."</B>
<P>
2547. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the people of Quba' fought until
they threw stones at one another. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was informed of that and said, "Let us go make a
reconciliation between them."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"There is nothing wrong in the couple
becoming reconciled. Reconciliation is better" </I>(4:128)</B>
<P>
2548. It is related from 'A'isha about <I>"If a woman fears cruelty or aversion
on her husband's part," </I>(4:128) "A man may see what he does not like
in his wife in the form of pride or something else and want to separate from
her. She then says, 'Keep me and allot for me what you wish.'" She said,
"There is nothing wrong if they are both satisfied."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: If people are reconciled based on an unjust reconciliation, the
reconciliation is rejected</B>
<P>
2549. It is related that Abu Hurayra and Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani said,
"A bedouin came and said, 'Messenger of Allah, judge between us by the Book
of Allah.' His opponent stood up and said, 'He speaks the truth. Judge between
us by the Book of Allah.' The bedouin said, 'My son works for this man and
he committed fornication with his wife. They told me, "Your son must be stoned,"
and so I ransomed my son with a hundred sheep and a slave-girl. Then I asked
the people of knowledge and they said, "Your son must receive a hundred lashes
and be exiled for a year."' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'I will judge between the two of you by the Book of Allah. The
slave-girl and sheep must be returned to you and your son must receive a
hundred lashes and be exiled for a year. Unays,' he said to a man, 'go to
the wife of this man and stone her.' So Unays went and stoned her."
<P>
2550. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who introduces an innovation
in this affair of ours which is not part of it, that will be rejected."

<B>VI: How it is recorded: "This is the reconciliation between so-and-so
the son of so-and-so and so-and-so the son of so-and-so" when one is not
ascribed to his tribe or lineage</B>
<P>
2551. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib was heard to say, "When the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made peace with the people
of al-Hudaybiyya, 'Ali wrote a document between them. He wrote, 'Muhammad,
the Messenger of Allah.' The idolaters said, 'Do not write "Muhammad, Messenger
of Allah". If you had been a Messenger, we would not have fought you.' He
said to 'Ali, 'Rub it out.' 'Ali said, 'I will not be the one to rub it out.'
So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rubbed
it out with his own hand and made peace with them provided that he and his
Companions would enter for three days and would only enter with their weapons
sheathed." They said, "What is the <I>julubban</I> of weapons?" He said,
"The cases they are in."
<P>
2552. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went on <I>'umra </I>during Dhu'l-Qa'da, but the people
of Makka refused to let him enter Makka until he concluded an agreement with
them that he would remain there three days. When they wrote the document,
they wrote, 'This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, concludes.' They
said, 'We will not ratify it. If we knew that you were the Messenger of Allah,
we would not have stopped you. Rather you are Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah' He
said, 'I am the Messenger of Allah, and I am Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah.' Then
he said to 'Ali, 'Rub out "Messenger of Allah".' He said, 'No, by Allah,
I will never rub you out.' So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, took the document and wrote, 'This is what Muhammad
ibn 'Abdullah concludes. No weapon will enter Makka except in a sheath. None
of its people will go out if he wishes to follow him and he will not prevent
any of his Companions who wishes to remain there.' When they entered Makka
and the term [agreed on] was up, they went to 'Ali and said, 'Tell your companion
to leave us for the term is up.'
<P>
&nbsp;"So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left and
they were followed by the daughter of Hamza, calling, 'Uncle! Uncle!' 'Ali
met her and took her hand and he said to Fatima, , 'Here is the daughter
of your uncle. Carry her.' 'Ali, Zayd and Ja'far quarrelled over her. 'Ali
said, 'I am more entitled to her. She is my uncle's daughter.' Ja'far said,
'She is my uncle's daughter and her maternal aunt is married to me.' Zayd
said, 'She is the daughter of my brother.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, judged that she should go with her maternal aunt and
said, 'The maternal aunt is in the position of the mother.' He said to 'Ali,
'You are from me and I am from you.' He said to Ja'far, 'You are like me
in character and physique.' He said to Zayd, 'You are our brother and our
client.'"

<P>
<B>VII: Peace with the idolaters</B>
<P>
This includes what Abu Sufyan said. 'Awf ibn Malik reported from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Then let there be a truce between
you and the Byzantines."
<P>
In it are Sahl ibn Hunayf, Asma' and al-Miswar from the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
2553. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made peace with the idolaters on
the Day of al-Hudaybiyya based on three things: that he would return any
of the idolaters who came to him, they would not return any of the Muslims
who came to them, and he would enter Makka the following year for three days
and would only enter it with weapons sheathed: the sword, the bow and the
like. Abu Jandal came hopping in his chains, and the Prophet returned him
to them."
<P>
Mu'ammal from Sufyan did not mention Abu Jandal. He said, "except with sheathed
weapons".
<P>
2554. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, set out to make <I>'umra</I>, but the unbelievers
of Quraysh came between him and the House. So he slaughtered his sacrificial
camels and shaved his head at al-Hudaybiyya and made an agreement with them
that he would make <I>'umra</I> the following year and they would carry no
weapons except swords, and they would only stay there at long as they wished.
So he mad<I>e 'umra </I>the following year and entered it in accordance with
their peace agreement. When he had remained there three days, they ordered
him to leave, and he left."
<P>

<P>
2556. It is related from Anas that ar-Rubayyi', the daughter of an-Nadr broke
the tooth of a girl and they demanded compensation, and they (her people)
asked for forgiveness, and they refused. They went to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, who commanded retaliation. Anas ibn an-Nadr
said, "Will the tooth of ar-Rubayyi' be broken, Messenger of Allah? No, by
the One who sent you with the truth, her tooth will not be broken!" He said,
"Anas, the [judgement of] the Book of Allah is retaliation." Then the people
were content to forgive [her], and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "There are some of the slaves of Allah who, if they swear
an oath, Allah will carry it out."
<P>
Al-Fazari added from Humayd from Anas, "The people were satisfied and agreed
to the payment of compensation."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
to al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, "This son of mine is a master. Perhaps Allah will make
peace between two great parties through him."</B>
<P>
The words of Allah, may His majesty be exalted, <I>"make peace between
them."</I> (49:9)
<P>
2557. It is related that al-Hasan [al-Basri] said, "By Allah, al-Hasan ibn
'Ali led squadrons like mountains against Mu'awiya. 'Amr ibn al-'As said,
'I see squadrons which will not turn back until theu have killed the like
of them.' Mu'awiya - and by Allah, he was the better of the two men - said
to him, "'Amr, if these kill those and those kill these, who will take charge
of the affairs of the people for me? Who will look after their women for
me? Who will look after their children for me?" So he sent to him two men
of Quraysh from the Banu 'Abdu Shamsh: 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Samura and 'Abdullah
ibn 'Amir ibn Kurayz. He said, "Go this man and offer him peace and speak
to him, and appeal to him." They went to him and visited him. They spoke
to him and talked to him and appealed to him. Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali said to him,
"We are the Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib. We have got some of this weath and this
community had indulged in spilling each other's blood and corruption [and
will only be content with money]." They said, "He [Mu'awiya] offers you
such-and-such and such-and such, and appeals to you and entreats you." He
said, "Who will guarantee this for me?" They said, "We are your guarantors
to it." No matter what he asked them for, they said, "We are your guarantors
to it." So he made peace with him. Al-Hasan [al-Basri] said, "I heard Abu
Bakra say, 'I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on
the minbar while al-Hasan ibn 'Ali was beside him, He would face the people
one moment and him the other. He said, '"This son of mine is a master. Perhaps
Allah will make peace between two great parties of the Muslims through him."'"
<P>
'Ali ibn 'Abdullah said, "It is established with us that al-Hasan heard this
<I>hadith</I> from Abu Bakra."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Should the ruler suggest reconciliation?</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw11.html#15">2558</A>. It is related that 'A'isha was heard to
say, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, heard
the sound of people quarrelling at the door in raised voices. One of them
was asking the other to reduce his debt and to show him a little leniency.
He said, 'By Allah, I will not do it.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went out to them both and said, 'Where is
the one who swore by Allah that he would not do what is good?' He said, "I,
Messenger of Allah. He can have what he likes.'"
<P>
2559. It is related from Ka'b ibn Malik that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Hadrad al-Aslami
owed him some money. He met him and pressed him until until their voices
were raised. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, passed
by them and said, "O Ka'b!" and he made a gesture with his hand as if he
were saying "A half". So he took half of what he was owed and left half.
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The excellence of reconciliation between people and justice between
them</B>
<P>
2560. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is <I>sadaqa</I> owed by
every joint people have every day on which the sun rises. Putting things
right between people is <I>sadaqa</I>."

<B>XII: When the ruler suggests reconciliation and it is refused, then a
ruling is made according to the clear judgement</B>
<P>
2561. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that az-Zubayr quarrelled with
a man of the Ansar who had been present at Badr about the irrigation canals
of the lava-beds, and they took the case to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. Each of them used it for irrigation. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to az-Zubayr, "Zubayr,
water, and then let the water pass to your neighbour." The Ansari became
angry and said, "Messenger of Allah, is it because he is your aunt's son?"
The face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
changed colour and then he said, "Water and then hold the water until it
reaches the wall." So at that time the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, gave az-Zubayr his full right. Before that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had suggested to az-Zubayr an opinion
which was generous for him and for the Ansari. When the Ansari angered the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he gave az-Zubayr
his full right according to the evident judgement. 'Urwa said that az-Zubayr
said, "By Allah, indeed I think that this <I>ayat</I> was revealed about
that<I>, "No, by your Lord, they are not believers until they make you their
judge in the disputes that break out between them.</I>"' (4:65)"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Reconciliation between creditors and those entitled to inheritance
and repayment by unmeasured amounts</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "There is no harm if two partners make a division and one
takes the debts and the other takes the assets. If the portion of either
of them is destroyed, he has no right to restoration from his companion."
<P>
2562. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "My father died owing
a debt. I suggested to his creditors that they take dates for what he owed,
but they refused, not thinking that there would be enough. I went to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned that to him.
He said, 'When you cut them and place them in the drying-place, inform the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He came with
Abu Bakr and 'Umar and sat where they were and prayed for blessing. Then
he said, 'Summon the creditors and pay them in full.' I did not omit anyone
to whom my father owed a debt without settling it. There still remained thirteen
<I>wasqs</I> - seven of <I>'ajwa </I>(excellent dates) and six of <I>lawn</I>
dates, or six of <I>'ajwa </I>and seven of <I>lawn</I>. I met with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at <I>Maghrib</I> and
I mentioned that to him. He smiled and said, 'Go to Abu Bakr and 'Umar and
tell them.' They said, 'We knew that that would be the case when the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did what he did.'"
<P>
Hisham said, "It is related from Wahb from Jabir, the <I>''Asr </I>prayer,'
and he did not mention Abu Bakr nor smiling. He said, 'My father left a debt
a thirty <I>wasqs</I>."
<P>
Ibn Ishaq says from Wahb from Jabir, "the <I>Dhuhr</I> prayer."
<P>

2563. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b that Ka'b ibn Malik informed
him that he demanded a debt which Ibn Abi Hadrad owed him in the mosque in
the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
Their voices were raised until the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, heard that while he was in his room. The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out to them and lifted
the curtain of his room. He called Ka'b ibn Malik and said, "Ka'b!" He said,
"At your service, Messenger of Allah." He made a gesture with his hand to
reduce half and Ka'b said, "I have done it, Messenger of Allah." The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Get up and settle
it."
