<P>
Allah Almighty says: <I>"If you are in a state of major impurity, then purify
yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey, or have come from the lavatory,
or have touched women, and cannot find any water, then do tayammum with pure
earth, and wipe your faces and your hands. Allah does not want to make things
difficult for you, but He does want to purify you and to perfect His blessing
upon you so that perhaps you may show thanks."</I> (5:6)
<P>
And Allah, may His mention be exalted! says,<I> "O you who believe! Do not
approach the prayer when you are drunk so that you know what you are saying,
nor in a state of major impurity &#150; unless you are travelling &#150;
until you have washed yourselves completely. If you are ill or on a journey,
or any of you have come from the lavatory or touched women, and you cannot
find any water, then do tayammum with pure earth, wiping your faces and your
hands. Allah is Ever-Pardoning, Ever-Forgiving."</I> (4:42)

<P>
<B>I: Performing <I>wudu' </I>before <I>ghusl</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#p69">245</A>. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of
the Prophet, that when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
performed <I>ghusl</I> for <I>janaba</I>, he would began by washing his hands
and then perform <I>wudu'</I> like he did<I> wudu' </I>for the prayer. Then
he put his fingers in the water, [then he would take water] and massage the
roots of his hair with them. Then he poured three handfuls on his head and
then poured water over the entire surface of his skin.
<P>
246. It is related that Maymuna, the wife of the Prophet, said, "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did <I>wudu</I>' as he did<I> wudu'
</I>for the prayer except for his feet. Then he washed his private parts
and anywhere that the discharge had gone. Then he poured water over himself
and then moved his feet to one side and washed them. This is how he performed
<I>ghusl</I> for <I>janaba</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: A man doing <I>ghusl</I> together with his wife</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#p70">247</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I used to do <I>ghusl</I> from
the same vessel from a pot called faraq.

<P>
248. It is related that Abu Salama was heard to say, "I and the brother of
'A'isha went to visit 'A'isha. Her brother asked her about the <I>ghusl</I>
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. She called for a
vessel containing about a sa'. She washed and poured it over her head. There
was a curtain between her and us."
<P>
It is related from Shu'ba, "the amount of a<I> sa'</I>."
<P>
249. It is related from Abu Ja'far that while he and his father were with
Jabir ibn 'Abdullah, there were some people with Jabir who asked him about
<I>ghusl</I>. He said, "<I>A sa' </I>is enough for you." A man stated, "A<I>
sa' </I>is not enough for me." Jabir said, "It was enough for one who had
more hair than you and was better than you." Then Jabir led us in the prayer
in a single garment.
<P>
250. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and Maymuna used to do <I>ghusl</I> from a single vessel.
<P>
It is related from Shu'ba, "the amount of a<I> sa'</I>."
<P>
Al-Bukhari said that in later stages Ibn 'Uyayna used to relate this
<I>hadith</I> on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who related this case from Maymuna,
but the correct version is what he has recorded earlier, i.e. omitting Maymuna.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Pouring water on the head three times</B>
<P>
251. It is related from Jubayr ibn Mut'im that the Messenger of Allah, may

- meaning al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya - came to me and asked about
<I>ghusl</I> for <I>janaba</I>. I said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to take three handfuls of water and pour them on
his head. Then he poured water over the rest of his body." Al-Hasan said
to me, "I am a man with a lot of hair." I replied, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had more hair than you."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: <I>Ghusl</I> (washing the body) is done once</B>
<P>
254. It is related that Maymuna said, "I put down water for <I>ghusl</I>

his private parts. Then he wiped his hand on the earth. Then he rinsed his
mouth and cleaned his nose by sniffing up and blowing out. He washed his
face and hands and then poured water over his body. Then he moved from where
he was and washed his feet."

<P>
255. It is related from &Otilde;A'isha, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, performed a <I>ghusl</I> for <I>janaba</I>, he called

side of his head and then the left side and then rubbed his head with both
hands."

the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He poured water onto

them. Then he rinsed out his mouth and cleaned his nose with water by sniffing
up and blowing out again. Then he washed his face and poured water on his
head. Then he moved to one side and washed his feet. He was given a towel
[to dry] but did not use it."
<P>
<P>

<P>
257. It is related from Maymuna, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, did a <I>ghusl</I> for <I>janaba</I>. He cleaned his private parts
with his hand, then rubbed it on the wall and then washed it. Then he did
<I>wudu' </I>as he did <I>wudu'</I> for the prayer. When he had finished
his <I>ghusl</I>, he washed his feet."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Can someone who is in <I>janaba</I> put his hand in the container
before he washes it if there is no impurity on his hand other than
<I>janaba</I>?</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar and al-Bara' ibn 'Azib put their hands in water without washing
them and then did <I>wudu'</I>.
<P>
Ibn 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas did not see any harm in any drops splashing from
the <I>ghusl</I> of <I>janaba</I> back into the water-container.
<P>
258. It is related from 'A'isha who said that, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and I used to do ghusl from the same vessel, and
our hands would alternate going into it."
<P>
259. It is related from 'A'isha, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, did <I>ghusl</I> for <I>janaba</I>, he washed
his hands first."

260. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and I used to do <I>ghusl</I> from the same vessel for
<I>janaba</I>."

<P>
261. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and one of his wives used to do <I>ghusl</I> from

<P>
262.It is related that Maymuna said, "I put down water for <I>ghusl</I> for
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he poured it on
his hands and washed them twice or three times. Then he poured water with
his right hand on his left hand and washed his private parts. Then he wiped
his hand on the earth. Then he rinsed his mouth and cleaned his nose by sniffing
up and blowing out. Then he washed his face and hands and washed his head
three times and then poured water over his body. Then he moved from where
he was and washed his feet."

<I>ghusl</I></B>
<P>
263. It is related that Maymuna bint al-Harith said, "I put down water for
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to do <I>ghusl</I>
and screened him. He poured water onto his hands and washed them once or
twice. Sulayman said, "I do not know whether three times was mentioned or
not. Then he poured water onto his left hand with his right hand and washed
his private parts. Then he rubbed his hand on the earth or on the wall. Then
he rinsed out his mouth and cleaned his nose by sniffing up and blowing out
and washed his face and hands and washed his head. Then he poured water over
his body. Then he moved to one side and washed his feet. I offered him a
cloth but he gesticulated with his hand like this and did not want it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: On having sexual intercourse and then repeating it again* and someone
making the rounds of his wives and only doing <I>ghusl</I> once</B>
<P>
[*<FONT COLOR="Navy"> The question is whether after every sexual intercourse
one has to do ghusl, so if he does it again, will he have to do a second
<I>ghusl</I>? The answer is that one only at the end will be sufficient,
but if someone can do ghusl every time he can do it.</FONT>]
<P>
264. It is related from Muhammad ibn al-Muntashir from his father who had
mentioned it to 'A'isha. She said, "May Allah have mercy on Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman!
I used to put scent on the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and he would have sex with his wives and in the morning he put
on ihram and he was still smelling of scent."
<P>
265. It is related from Qatada that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to make the rounds of all his wives
at one go either at night or during the day - and he had eleven wives. Qatada

he had been given the strength of thirty men."

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,..." see 264.
<P>
268. It is related from 'A'isha, "It is as if I could see the glistening

by washing his hands and then did<I> wudu'</I> like he did <I>wudu' </I>for
the prayer. Then he did <I>ghusl</I>. He ran his fingers through his hair
until he felt that his scalp was wet. Then he poured water on his head three
times and then he washed the rest of his body."
<P>
She added, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

that he was junub. He said to us, 'Stay where you are,' and went back and
did <I>ghusl</I>. Then he came out to us with his head dripping. He said,

<P>
<P>
<B>XX: Doing <I>ghusl</I> naked in a secluded place, or while screened, and
being screened is better</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "It is more proper
for someone to be modest before Allah than before people."
<P>
274. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The Banu Isra'il used to bathe naked, looking
at each other. Musa used to take a bath alone. They said, 'By Allah! The
only thing which prevents Musa from bathing with us is that he has a scrotal
hernia. Once Musa went to take a bath and placed his garment on a stone and
the stone ran off with it. Musa went after it, saying, 'My clothes, O stone!'
until the Banu Isra'il looked at Musa and said, 'By Allah, there is nothing
wrong with Musa.' He took his garment and began to strike the stone."
<P>
Abu Hurayra said, "By Allah, the stone still has six or seven marks from
the beating."
<P>
275. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "When Ayyub was bathing while naked, golden locusts
began to fall on him and Ayyub began to collect them in his garment. His
Lord called to him, 'O Ayyub! Have We not made you wealthy enough not to
need what you see?' He said, 'Yes, indeed, by Your might, but I still need
Your blessing!.'"
<P>
The same is related from Abu Hurayra with another <I>isnad</I>.
<P>
<P>

people</B>
<P>
276. It is related that Umm Hani' bint Abi Talib said, "I went to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of the Conquest
of Makka and found him doing <I>ghusl</I> while Fatima was screening him.
He asked, 'Who is it?' I said, 'It is Umm Hani.'"
<P>
277. It is related that Maymuna said, 'I screened the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, when he was doing a <I>ghusl</I> for
<I>janaba</I>. He washed his hand and then poured water on his left hand
with his right hand and washed his private parts. Then he rubbed his hand
on the wall or the earth. Then he performed <I>wudu' </I>like he did
<I>wudu'</I> for the prayer except for his feet. Then he poured water over
his body. Then he moved to one side and washed his feet."
<P>
Abu 'Awana and Ibn Fudayl corroborated [in relating from A'mash], the screening.

<P>
278. It is related that Umm Salama, the Umm al-Mu'minin, said, "Umm Sulaym,
the wife of Abu Talha, came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allah is not ashamed
of the truth. Does a woman have to perform a <I>ghusl</I> when she has a
sexual dream?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'Yes, if she sees any discharge.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: The sweat of someone who is in <I>janaba</I>. A Muslim does not
become impure</B>
<P>
279. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, met me in one of the streets of Madina when I was junub.
I slipped away from him and went and did ghusl. Then I returned back, the
Prophet said, 'Where have you been, Abu Hurayra?' I replied, "I was junub,
and I do not like to be in your company when I am not in a pure state.' He
said, 'Glory be to Allah! A Muslim never becomes impure!'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: A person who is in <I>janaba</I> can go out and walk in the market
and elsewhere</B>
<P>

clipped and his head shaved even if he has not done <I>wudu</I>'.
<P>
280. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to have sex with all his wives in the same night
and he had nine wives."
<P>
281. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, met me when I was in <I>janaba</I> and took my hand
and I went with him until he sat down. Then I slipped away, went home and
performed a <I>ghusl</I>. When I came back, he was still sitting there and
he said, 'Where have you been, Abu Hirr?' I told him about it, and he said,
'Glory be to Allah! Abu Hirr, the believer never becomes impure.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: A person who is in <I>janaba</I> staying at home and doing <I>wudu'
</I>before doing<I> ghusl</I></B>
<P>
282. It is related that Abu Salama said, "I asked 'A'isha, 'Did the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, go to sleep when he was in
<I>janaba</I>?' She said, 'Yes, but he did wudu'.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: The sleeping of someone in <I>janaba</I></B>
<P>
283. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab asked the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Can one of us sleep while he is
in <I>janaba</I>?" He replied, "Yes, if you do <I>wudu'</I>, then you can
sleep in a state of <I>janaba</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: Someone who is in <I>janaba</I> may do <I>wudu' </I>before he goes
to sleep </B>
<P>
284. It is related from 'A'isha, "Whenever the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, wanted to go to sleep when he was in<I> janaba</I>,
he would wash his private parts and do <I>wudu'</I> like he did <I>wudu'</I>
for the prayer."
<P>
285. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "'Umar asked the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, for a <I>fatwa</I> (legal decision), 'Can
any of us go to sleep when he is in <I>janaba</I>?' He replied, 'Yes, if
he does wudu'.'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#p78">286.</A> It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that
'Umar ibn al-Khattab mentioned to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, that he sometimes found himself in <I>janaba</I>
at night. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
told him, 'Do <I>wudu'</I>, wash your private parts, and then sleep.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: When male and female private parts meet</B>
<P>
287. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'When a man lies between a woman's limbs and penetrates
her, then <I>ghusl</I> becomes obligatory.'"
<P>
'Amr ibn Marzuq corroborated this, relating something similar from Shu'ba
[from Qatada]. The same thing is related from al-Hasan.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: Washing off what comes from a woman's private parts</B>
<P>
288. It is related that Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani asked 'Uthman ibn 'Affan,
"What do you think about a man who has sexual intercourse with his wife and
does not ejaculate?" 'Uthman said, "He should do <I>wudu</I>' as he does
<I>wudu'</I> for the prayer and wash his private parts. I heard that from
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
Zayd said, "I asked 'Ali ibn Talib, az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam, Talha ibn
'Ubaydullah and Ubayy ibn Ka'b about it and they also said that.
<P>
Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said that he heard that from Abu Ayyub that he heard from
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
289. It is related that Ubayy ibn Ka'b said, "Messenger of Allah, what about
when a man has intercourse with a woman and does not ejaculate?"
<P>
He said, "He should wash what has touched the woman and then do <I>wudu'
</I>and pray."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah [al-Bukhari] said, "Doing <I>ghusl</I> is safer and that was
the last order. We have made their disagreement clear."

<B>II: Instructions to women when they start to menstruate</B>
<P>
290. It is related from al-Qasim, "I heard 'A'isha say, 'We set out with
no other intention than to perform <I>hajj</I>. When we reached Sarif*, I
started to menstruate. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant

Have you started your period?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'This is something

on <I>hajj</I> does but do not do <I>tawaf</I> of the House.' She said, 'The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sacrificed a
cow on behalf of his wives.'"

<B>III A menstruating woman washing her husband's head and combing his hair</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#p104">291</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I used
to comb the head of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, while I was menstruating."
<P>
292. It is related from 'Urwa that he was asked, "Can a menstruating woman
serve me? Can a woman who is in <I>janaba</I> come near me?" 'Urwa said,
"None of that bothers me. All of those women could serve me and there is
no harm for anyone in that. 'A'isha told me that she used to comb the head
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while
she was menstruating and while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was in <I>i'tikaf </I>(retreat) in the mosque. He would
move his head near to her, she being in her room, and she would comb his
hair while she was menstruating."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: A man reciting Qur'an in his wife's lap while she is menstruating.</B>
<P>
Abu Wa'il used to send his servant girl who was menstruating to bring the
Qur'an from Abu Razin. She would hold it by its strap.
<P>
293. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to recline on my lap while I was menstruating and recite
the Qur'an."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Using the word "<I>nifas</I>" for menstruation*</B>
<P>
[*<FONT COLOR="Navy">The word <I>nifas</I> is used for the bleeding of women
after childbirth, but sometimes it is used for menstruation as well. This
is the point al-Bukhari wants to clarify.</FONT>]
<P>
294. It is related that Umm Salama said, "Once while I was lying with the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, under a black woollen cover
I started my menstrual period and I slipped away to get my menstruation clothes.
He said, 'Have you started menstruating (<I>tanfusti</I>)?" I said. 'Yes.'
He called to me and I lay down again with him under the cover."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Fondling a menstruating woman</B>
<P>
295. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and I used to wash from the same container when we were
both in <I>janaba</I>. While I was menstruating, he told me to wrap my
waist-wrapper around myself and then he cuddled me. He would hold his head
out to me when he was in<I> i'tikaf</I> (retreat in the mosque) and I would
wash it while I was menstruating."
<P>
296. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When one of us was menstruating and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wanted to
fondle her, he would tell her to put on a waist-wrapper when she started
her menstrual period and he would fondle her." She said, "Who among you would
be able to control his desires as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace,controlled his?"
<P>
Khalid and Jarir corroborated with 'Ali ibn Mishar in relating his from
ash-Shaybani.
<P>
297. It is related that Maymuna was heard to say, "When the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,wanted to fondle one of his
wives, he told her, if she was menstruating, to put on a waist-wrapper."
<P>
Sufyan related it from ash-Shaybani.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Menstruating women refraining from fasting</B>
<P>
298. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set out to the place of prayer on
the Day of <I>Adha</I> or <I>Fitr</I> and passed by the women. He said, 'O
congregation of women! Give alms for I have seen that you will make up the
majority of the inhabitants of the Fire!' They said, 'Why, Messenger of Allah?'
He said, 'You call down too many curses and show ingratitude to your husbands.
I have not seen anyone more deficient in intellect or deen. Yet the mind
of even a resolute man might be swept away by one of you.' They said, 'In
what way is our deen and intellect deficient, Messenger of Allah?' He said,
'Is not the testimony of a woman worth only half that of a man?' They said,
'Yes.' He said, 'That is how your intellect is deficient. Is it not so that
when a woman is menstruating, she neither prays nor fasts?' They said, 'Yes.'
He said, 'That is how her <I>deen</I> is deficient.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: A woman who is menstruating should perform all the duties of the
<I>hajj</I> except for <I>tawaf</I> of the House</B>
<P>
Ibrahim said, "There is no harm in her reciting a verse of the Qur'an."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas did not see any harm in the recitation of [the Qur'an] by someone
who is in <I>janaba</I>.
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned Allah at
all times [which includes recitation of the Qur'an].
<P>
Umm 'Atiyya said, "We were ordered to let menstruating women go out [for
the prayer] and call out <I>takbirs</I> together with the men's
<I>takbirs</I> and make supplication.
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that he was told by Abu Sufyan that Heraclius asked for the
letter of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and read
it. It said,<I> "In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate. O
People of the Book! Come to a proposition which is the same for us and
you."</I>
<P>
'Ata' stated that Jabir said, "'A'isha started menstruating and performed
all the rites of <I>hajj</I> except <I>tawaf</I> of the House and she did
not pray."
<P>
Al-Hakam said, "I slaughter even when I am in <I>janaba</I> [mentioning the
name of Allah in this state]." Allah says<I>, "Do not eat anything over which
the name of Allah has not been mentioned."</I> (6:121)
<P>
299. It is related that 'A'isha said, "''We set out with the Prophet , may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, with no other intention than to perform
<I>hajj</I>. When we reached Sarif, I started to menstruate. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came upon me while I was weeping.
He said, 'What has made you weep?' I said, 'I wish , by Allah, that I had
not made <I>hajj</I> this year.' He said, "'Is it that you have started to
menstruate?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'This is something which Allah has decreed
for the daughters of Adam so do everything someone on <I>hajj</I> does but
do not do <I>tawaf</I> of the House until you are pure.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: False menstruation [bleeding between menstrual periods]</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#p106">300</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, " Fatima
bint Hubaysh told the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, 'Messenger of Allah, I never become clean. Should I abandon the prayer?'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;said,
'That is due to a vein, not menstruation. When menstruation comes, then stop
praying. When your menstrual period ends, then wash off the blood and pray.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Washing off menstrual blood</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#p105">301</A>. It is related that Asma' bint Abi Bakr
said, "A woman asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, 'Messenger of Allah, what do you think a woman should do if menstrual
blood gets on her clothes?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'If menstrual blood gets onto your clothes, she should
gather up the place in her fingers, rub it, and wash it with water and then
she can pray in it.'"
<P>
302. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When one of us had menstruated, she
would, when she was clean again, gather up any place on her garment with
blood on it, rub it, wash it and sprinkle water on the rest of it. Then she
would pray in it."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: A woman with false menstruation doing retreat in the mosque for
<I>i'tikaf</I></B>
<P>
303. It is related from 'A'isha that one of the wives of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, did<I> i'tikaf </I>along with him when
she had false menstruation. She would see blood and sometimes put a dish
under her for the blood. 'Ikrima claimed that 'A'isha saw some safflower
liquid and said, "This is like what so-and-so used to find."
<P>
304. It is related that 'A'isha said, "One of the wives of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did <I>i'tikaf </I>with
him. She used to see blood and yellow discharge and would put a dish under
her while she was praying."
<P>
305. It is related from 'A'isha that one of the Mothers of the Believers
did <I>i'tikaf</I> while she had false menstruation.
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Can a woman pray in the clothes in which she has menstruated?</B>
<P>
306. It is related that 'A'isha said, "None of us had more than a single
garment and we menstruated while wearing it. When a drop blood fell on it,
we would spit on it and scratch it off with our nails."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: A woman using perfume when she does <I>ghusl</I> after menstruation</B>
<P>
307. It is related from Umm 'Atiyya from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, "We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more
than three days except for a husband for whom the period was four months
and ten days. We would not put on kohl or perfume or wear coloured clothes
except<I> 'asb</I> (coarse Yemeni coloured) garments. When we purified ourselves
by doing <I>ghusl</I> after menstruation, we were allowed a small amount
of light perfume. We were forbidden to join funeral processions."
<P>
Hisham ibn Hassan related it from Umm 'Atiyya via Hafsa.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: A woman should rub herself thoroughly when she becomes clean after
menstruation. How she should wash herself and use a perfumed piece of cloth
[maybe of musk] to wipe off any traces of blood</B>
<P>
308. It is related that 'A'isha said, "A woman asked the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, about <I>ghusl</I> after menstruation. He
told her how to wash, saying, 'Take a piece of cloth scented with musk and
purify yourself with it.'
<P>
She repeated, 'How shall I purify myself with it?'
<P>
He said, 'Purify yourself with it.'
<P>
She said,'How?'
<P>
He said, 'Glory be to Allah! Purify yourself with it!'"
<P>
['A'isha said,] "I pulled her towards me and said, 'Wipe off any traces of
blood with it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Washing the place of menstruation</B>
<P>
309. It is related that 'A'isha said, "A woman of the Ansar said to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'How should I do <I>ghusl</I> after
menstruation?' He said, 'Take a piece of perfumed cloth and clean yourself
three times.' Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
became embarrassed and turned his face away. (Or he said, 'Clean yourself
with it.') I took her and pulled her to one side and explained to her what
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, meant."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: A woman combing her hair when she does <I>ghusl</I> after
menstruation</B>
<P>
310. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I assumed <I>ihram</I> with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the <I>Hajj</I> of
Farewell and I was one of those intending to do<I> tamattu' </I>(a way of
performing <I>hajj</I> and<I> 'umra</I>) but did not take any sacrificial
animals with me." She said that she started to menstruate and did not become
clean until the night of 'Arafa. She said, "Messenger of Allah, this is the
night of 'Arafa and I had meant to perform <I>'umra</I>." The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, "Undo your hair
and comb it and postpone your <I>'umra</I>."
<P>
She said, "I did that and completed the hajj. On the night of al-Hasaba,
the Prophet ordered 'Abdu'r-Rahman to take me to at-Tan'im to do <I>'umra
</I>in place of the <I>'umra </I>I had meant to perform."
<P>
[<FONT COLOR="Navy">al-Hasaba: Muhassab. 'Abdu'r-Rahman was her brother.

<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: A woman should undo her hair when performing <I>ghusl</I> after
menstruation</B>
<P>
311. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We set off at the approach of Dhu'l-Hijja
[that is the month for <I>hajj</I>] for the <I>hajj</I>. The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever wants to assume
<I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>should do so. If I had not brought sacrifice,
I would have assumed <I>ihram</I> for<I> 'umra</I>. Some of us assumed
<I>ihram</I> for<I> 'umra</I> and some for <I>hajj</I>. I was one of those
who assumed <I>ihram</I> for<I> 'umra.</I> When the day of 'Arafat came,
I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and he said, 'Postpone your <I>'umra</I> and undo your
hair and comb it and put on <I>ihram</I> for <I>hajj</I>.' I did that. On
the night of al-Hasaba [ i.e. the night they stayed at al-Muhassab], he sent
my brother, 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, with me and I went out to at-Tan'im.
I assumed <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>to make up for my<I> 'umra</I>."
<P>
Hisham said, "For that, neither sacrifice nor fasting nor <I>sadaqa</I> was
required."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: <I>"Flesh formed yet unformed."</I> (22:5)</B>
<P>
312. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Allah the Mighty and Majestic appoints an
angel to every womb who says, 'O Lord! A sperm drop! O Lord A clot! O Lord!
A lump of flesh! ' Then if He desires to complete His creation, He does so
and the angel asks, 'Is it to be male or female? Wretched or happy? What
is its provision? What is its life-span?' This is all decreed in the mother's
womb."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: How menstruating women assume <I>ihram</I> for <I>hajj</I> and
<I>'umra</I></B>
<P>
313. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We set off with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, on the <I>Hajj</I> of Farewell. Some of us
assumed <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I> and some for <I>hajj</I>. We reached
Makka and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Whoever assumed <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I> and does not have a
sacrifice should come out of <I>ihram</I>. Whoever assumed <I>ihram</I> for
<I>'umra</I> and has a sacrifice should not come out of ihram until he has
slaughtered his sacrifice. Whoever assumed <I>ihram</I> for <I>hajj</I> should
complete his <I>hajj</I>."
<P>
'A'isha said, "I started to menstruate and continued until the Day of 'Arafa
and I had only assumed <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, commanded me to undo my hair and comb it and
to assume <I>ihram</I> for the hajj and abandon the<I> 'umra</I>. I did that
and finished my <I>hajj</I>. Then he sent 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr with
me and told me to do an <I>'umra</I>, to replace my (missed) <I>'umra</I>,
from at-Tan'im."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: The beginning and end of menstruation</B>
<P>
Some women used to send 'A'isha little boxes containing pieces of cotton
cloth which still showed some yellowness. 'A'isha would say, "Do not rush
[to do <I>ghusl</I>] until you see white cotton," meaning by that purity
from menstruation.
<P>
The daughter of Zayd ibn Thabit was told that the women were asking for lamps
in the middle of the night to check their purity. She said, "Women never
used to do this," and criticised them.
<P>
314. It is related from 'A'isha that Fatima bint Abi Hubaysh used to suffer
from false menstruation and so she asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, who said, "That is only a blood vessel, not menstruation,
so when your menstrual period approaches, stop the prayer, and when it finishes,
take a bath and pray."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: A menstruating woman should not make up the prayer</B>
<P>
Jabir and Abu Sa'id said that the Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "She must abandon the prayer."
<P>
315. It is related from Mu'adha that a woman asked 'A'isha, "Should we make
up the prayer when we become clean?" She said, "Are you from Harura'? [i.e.
are you a Kharijite? ] When we were with the Prophet, we got our menstrual
periods and he did not command us to do that." (or she said, "We did not
do that.")
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: Sleeping with a menstruating woman who is wearing her (special
menstruation) clothes </B>
<P>
316. It is related from Zaynab bint Abi Salama, "Umm Salama said, "Once while
I was with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, under a
black woollen cover I started my menstrual period and I slipped away and
came out of it and got my menstruation clothes. The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'Have you started menstruating?"
I said. 'Yes.' He called to me and I lay down again with him under the cover."
<P>
She related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used
to kiss her while he was fasting and [she said], "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and I used to do a <I>ghusl</I> from the same
vessel for <I>janaba</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: Wearing a special garment for menstruation other than the clothes
worn during the time of the clean period</B>
<P>
317. It is related that Umm Salama said, "Once while I was lying with the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, under a black woollen cover
I started my menstrual period and I slipped away to get my menstruation clothes.
He said, 'Have you started menstruating?" I said. 'Yes.' He called to me
and I lay down again with him under the cover."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: Menstruating women being present at the two<I> 'Id </I>festivals
and other meetings of the Muslims but staying away from the place of prayer</B>
<P>
318. It is related from Ayyub that Hafsa said, "We used to keep our young
women from going out for the two <I>'Ids</I>. A woman came and stayed at
the fortress of the Banu Khalaf and she related that her sister, whose husband
had been on twelve expeditions with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and who had herself gone with him on six of them, said,
'We used to treat the wounded and care for the sick.' 'My sister asked the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Is there any harm in one
of us not going out if she does not have an outer garment?" He said, "Her
companion should let her share her outer covering garment and take part in
the good actions and gatherings of the Muslims." When Umm 'Atiyya came, I
asked her if she had heard that from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace,and she said, "By my father, yes - whenever she mentioned
the Prophet, she always said, "by my father" - I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Young unmarried women, mature women
- or young girls who are veiled - and menstruating women should go out and
take part in the good actions and meetings of the believers, but menstruating
women should stay away from the place of prayer.'"'"
<P>
Hafsa said, "I said, 'Menstruating women?' She said, 'Do they not attend
'Arafa, and so on and so on.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: When a woman menstruates three times a month. What should be believed
from women regarding menstruation and pregnancy and what is possible regarding
menstruation according to the words of Allah,<I> "It is not lawful for them
to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs."</I> (2:228)</B>
<P>
'Ali and Shurayh said, "If a woman brings testimony from members of her close
family, who are known to be good Muslims, that she menstruates three times
a month, she should be believed."
<P>
'Ata' said [in case of 'idda, i.e. waiting period], "Her past menstrual pattern
should be taken into account." Ibrahim also said the same thing.
<P>
'Ata' said, "Menstruation can last from one to fifteen days." Mu'tamir said
that when his father asked Ibn Sirin about a woman who sees blood five days
after the end of her menstrual period, he said, "Women have more knowledge
about those things."
<P>
319. It is related from 'A'isha that Fatima bint Abi Hubaysh said to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "I have persistent bleeding
and never become clean. Should I stop praying?" He said, "No, that is due
to a blood vessel, not menstruation so stop the prayer for the days when
you are menstruating and then do ghusl and pray."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: Yellow discharge and discoloration outside the days of menstruation</B>
<P>
320. It is related from Umm 'Atiyya, "We did not consider yellow discharge
and discoloration to be anything."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: A blood vessel being the cause of false menstruation</B>
<P>
321. It is related that &nbsp;'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "Umm
Habiba suffered from false menstruation for seven years. She asked the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about that and he told
her, 'This is due to a blood vessel.' She used to do <I>ghusl</I> for every
prayer."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: A woman who starts menstruating after the <I>Tawaf al-Ifada</I>
</B>
<P>
322. It is related that &nbsp;'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said to the
Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Messenger of
Allah, Safiyya bint Huyayy has started menstruating." He said, "She may well
delay us. Did she not do the<I> Tawaf [al-Ifada] </I>with you?" They said,
"Yes." He said (to her), "So you can leave."
<P>
323. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A menstruating woman is permitted
to leave [before doing the Farewell <I>Tawaf</I>] if she starts menstruating
[before doing the Farewell <I>Tawaf</I>]. Ibn 'Umar used to say at first
that she should not leave and then I heard him say, "She can leave since
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;allowed
women to do that."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: When a woman who suffers from false menstruation notices that
she has become clean</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that she should do <I>ghusl</I> and pray, even if the prayer
time only has one hour left, and her husband can have sexual intercourse
with her when she has prayed, but the prayer is more important.
<P>
324. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'When menstruation comes, stop the prayer and when
it ends, then wash the blood from yourself, [take a bath] and pray.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: Doing the funeral prayer over a woman who has died during her period
of bleeding after childbirth and the manner of her funeral prayer</B>
<P>
<B> </B>325. It is related from Samura ibn Jundub that a woman died during
childbirth and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did
the funeral prayer over her and stood opposite the middle of her body.
<P>
326. It is related from Maymuna, the wife of the Prophet, that when she was
menstruating, she did not pray, but she would sit in front of where the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was prostrating while
he was praying on his mat. She said, "When he prostrated, some of his clothing
would touch me."

<A HREF="muw1.html#p91">327</A>. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of
the Prophet, said, "We went out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, on one of his journeys until, when we had reached
al-Bayda, or Dhat al-Jaysh, my necklace broke and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stayed to look for it and everyone
else stayed with him. There was no water there, so the people went to Abu
Bakr as-Siddiq and said, 'Do you not see what 'A'isha has done? She has caused
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and everyone
else to halt at a place where there is no water for them nor are they carrying
any water with them?' Abu Bakr came and found that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had gone to sleep with his head
against my thigh. He said, 'You have held up the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and everyone else in a place where there
is no water and they are not carrying any water with them!' Abu Bakr rebuked
me saying what Allah wished him to say and started to poke me in the side
with his hand and the only reason I did not move was that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was against my thigh. At
first light the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
got up and found that there was no water. Then Allah sent down the verse
of <I>tayammum</I>. So they did <I>tayammum</I>." Usayd ibn al-Hudayr said,
'Family of Abu Bakr, this is not the first blessing you have brought!'."
'A'isha continued, "We made the camel I was on get up and found the necklace
underneath it."

five things which no one before me was given: I have been helped to victory
by terror flooding (my enemies') hearts up<I> </I>to a month's journey away;
for me, the whole earth has been made a mosque and made pure (for purification
by <I>tayammum</I>) - wherever a man of my community finds himself when the
time of prayer comes, he can pray; taking booty has been made lawful for
me when it was not lawful for anyone before me; I have been given the right
of intercession; and whereas every other Prophet was sent only to his people,
I have been sent to all mankind.'"

<B>I: When neither water nor earth is available</B>
<P>
329. It is related that 'A'isha said that she borrowed a necklace from Asma'
and it disappeared. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, sent a man who found it. The time of the prayer found them with
no water so they prayed but then voiced their anxiety about doing that to
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Allah
sent down the <I>Ayat</I> of <I>Tayammum</I>. Usayd ibn Hudayr said to 'A'isha,
"May Allah reward you! By Allah, nothing unpleasant ever happens to you,
without Allah making it a means of good for both you and the Muslims."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The performance of <I>tayammum</I> by a resident when there is no
water available and he fears that he will miss the prayer</B>
<P>
'Ata' and al-Hasan said that when a sick person has water but cannot find
anyone to hand it to him, he can do <I>tayammum</I>. Ibn 'Umar was coming
from his land in al-Jurf and the time for <I>'Asr </I>came when he reached
Marbad an-Na'am. He prayed (doing <I>tayammum</I>) and then entered Madina
while the sun was still high, but did not repeat the prayer.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Navy">[al-Jurf is a place close to Madina used sometimes as
a military camp before expeditions. Marbad an-Na'am is where the camels are
kept</FONT>]
<P>
330. It is related that 'Umayr, the mawla of Ibn 'Abbas, was heard to say,
"'Abdullah ibn Yasar, the <I>mawla</I> of Maymuna, the wife of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I went to visit Abu Juhaym ibn
al-Harith ibn Simma al-Ansari. Abu Juhaym said, 'Once the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was coming from the direction of Bi'r Jamal*.
A man met him and greeted him but the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, did not reply to him until he came to a wall. He wiped his face
and hands and then returned his greeting.'"

<P>
<B>III: Can someone doing <I>tayammum</I> blow on his hands?</B>
<P>
331. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abza related that his father said, "A man came to
'Umar ibn al-Khattab and said, 'I was junub and could not find any water.'
'Ammar ibn Yasir said to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, 'Do you remember once when
you and I were on a journey and you did not pray but I rolled on the ground
and prayed? I mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'It would have been enough for you to do this.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, beat the earth with his hands, blew on them and
then wiped his face and hands with them."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: <I>Tayammum</I> is for the face and hands</B>
<P>
332. Sa'id ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abza related from his father that 'Ammar
said that. Shu'ba beat the earth with his hands and brought them up to his
mouth and then wiped his face and hands with them.
<P>
'Ammar said, "Pure earth is a sufficient means of purification for a Muslim
in the event of there being no water."
<P>
333. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abza related that once while his father was with
'Umar, 'Ammar said to 'Umar, "We were on an expedition and became
<I>junub</I>." And he said that he had blown on his hands.
<P>
334. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, "'Ammar said to 'Umar, "I rolled
in the dust and came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
who said, 'Your face and hands would have been enough.'"
<P>
335. 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, "I saw 'Umar when 'Ammar said to him" and the
<I>hadith</I> continues.
<P>
336. It is related that 'Ammar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, beat the earth with his hands and wiped his face and hands."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Pure earth is a sufficient means of purification for a Muslim in the
event of there being no water. </B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "<I>Tayammum</I> is enough as long as you do nothing to break
it." Ibn 'Abbas led the prayer after doing <I>tayammum</I>. Yahya ibn Sa'id
said, "There is nothing wrong in doing the prayer on salty land or in using
it for doing <I>tayammum</I>."
<P>
337. It is related that 'Imran said, "We were on a journey with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we travelled until late in the
night when we stopped at a place, and no stop is more welcome in the eyes
a traveller than that. We were woken up by the heat of the sun. The first
of us to wake up was so-and-so and then so-and-so. (Abu Raja' named them,
but 'Awf forgot.) The fourth person was 'Umar ibn al-Khattab. When the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, slept, we would not wake him until
he woke up of his own accord because we did not know what might be happening
to him while he was asleep. Being a strict man, when 'Umar woke up and saw
what had happened to everyone he called out, 'Allah is greater!' in a loud
voice. He continued to call out the takbir loudly until the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was woken up by his voice. When he woke
up, the people expressed their anxiety to him about what had happened to
them. He said, 'There is no harm - or it will not cause harm. Travel on.'
They went on a short distance and then stopped. The Prophet called for<I>
wudu' </I>water and did <I>wudu'</I>. The call for the prayer was given and
he led the people in the prayer. When he had finished the prayer, he noticed
a man who had kept himself apart and not prayed with the people. He said,
'So-and-so! What kept you from praying with everyone else?' He said, 'I am
in <I>janaba</I> and there is no water.' The Prophet said, 'You must use
the bare earth. That will be enough for you.'
<P>
"Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, travelled on
and the people complained to him that they were thirsty. He stopped and called
someone (Abu Raja' named him but 'Awf forgot) and 'Ali and said, 'Go and
look for water.' They went off and came across a woman on a camel sitting
between two water bags. They asked her, 'Where is the water?' She said, 'I
was at the water this time yesterday and our people are behind me.' They
said to her, 'Come then.' She said, 'Where to?' They said, 'To the Messenger
of Allah.' She said, 'The one known as "as-Sabi'?"* They said, 'The very
same; so come along with us.'
<P>
"They brought her to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and told him the story. He said, 'Help her dismount from her camel.' The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for a container
and opened the mouths of the bags into it. Then he closed their mouths.and
opened their lower openings. The people were told, 'Drink and water the animals.'
Whoever wished drank from it and whoever wished watered from it.and finally
the Prophet gave the man who was junub a jug of water and said, 'Go and pour
it over yourself.' The woman was standing there watching what was being done
with her water and, by Allah, when the bags were handed back, it seemed to
us that they were fuller than they had been at the beginning! The Prophet.
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Make a collection for her,'
They collected for her enough of the best dates, flour and <I>sawiq</I> to
make a meal and put it in a cloth. They then put her on her camel and placed
the cloth in front of her. He said to her, 'We did not take any of your water,
but Allah is the One who gave us water.'
<P>
"When she reached her people from whom she had been kept back, they said,
"So-and-so! What delayed you?' She said, 'A strange thing happened! Two men
met me and took me to the man called "as-Sabi' and he did such-and-such.
By Allah, he is either the greatest sorcerer between here and there - and
she used her middle and index fingers and raised them towards the sky, meaning
between the heaven and the earth - or he is indeed truly the Messenger of
Allah.'
<P>
"After this the Muslims would attack the idolaters around her but never touched
the tents where she lived. One day, she said to her people, 'I think that
these people leave you alone deliberately. Is there not something for you
in Islam?' They responded to her and entered Islam."
<P>
[*<I>as-Sabi' </I>means someone who changes religion.]
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: If someone who is in <I>janaba</I> fears that he will become ill or
die or is afraid of thirst, he can do <I>tayammum</I>.</B>
<P>
It is mentioned that 'Amr ibn al-'As was in <I>janaba</I> on a cold night
and did <I>tayammum</I> and recited from the Qur'an, <I>"Do not kill yourselves.
Allah is merciful to you.</I>" (4:29) That was mentioned to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;and he did not object to it.
<P>
338. It is related from Abu Wa'il, "Abu Musa said to 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud,
'If you cannot find any water, should you pray or not?' 'Abdullah said, 'If
you were to give them a dispensation (to do <I>tayammum</I>) in this instance,
they would do this (i.e. <I>tayammum</I>) even if they found water and it
was cold and pray.' Abu Musa said, 'What do you make of what 'Ammar said
to 'Umar?' He said, 'I do not think that 'Umar was happy with what 'Ammar
said.'"
<P>
339. It is related that Shaqiq ibn Salama was heard to say, "I was with 'Abdullah
and Abu Musa and Abu Musa said to him, &#180;Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman, what do
you think someone should do if he is in <I>janaba</I> and cannot find any
water?' 'Abdullah said, 'He should not pray until he finds water.' Abu Musa
said, 'So what about 'Ammar&#180;s statement that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'It (<I>tayammum</I>) would have
been enough for you?' He replied, 'Don't you see that 'Umar was not happy
with that?' Abu Musa said, 'All right, putting aside what 'Ammar said, what
do you make of this <I>ayat</I> (of <I>tayammum</I>)?''Abdullah did not know
what to say and then said, ''If we were to give them a dispensation (to do
<I>tayammum</I>) in this instance, even if they the water they found was
cold, they would probably leave it and do <I>tayammum</I>, ' I said to Shaqiq,
"Did 'Abdullah [ibn Mas'ud] dislike doing <I>tayammum</I> because of this?"
He said, "Yes."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: <I>Tayammum</I> is done by striking the earth once </B>
<P>
340. It is related that al-A'mash said that Shaqiq said, "While I was sitting
with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, Abu Musa said to him, 'If someone
is in <I>janaba</I> and cannot find any water for a month, can he do
<I>tayammum</I> and pray? In that case, what do you make of this verse in
<I>Surat al-Ma'ida</I>: '<I>If you cannot find any water, then do tayammum
with pure earth</I>' 'Abdullah said, 'If this dispensation were given to
them, then, even if they had water but it was cold, they would probably do
<I>tayammum</I> with pure earth.' I asked Shaqiq, &#180;You dislike tayammum
because of that?' He said, 'Yes.'
<P>
"Abu Musa continued, &#180;Have you not heard what 'Ammar said to 'Umar?
- "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent
me on some errand and I became <I>junub</I> and could not find any water
so I rolled in the dust like an animal does. I mentioned that to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'It would have been
enough for you to do this,' and he beat the earth once with his hands, blew
on them and then wiped the back of his right hand with his left or the back
of his left hand with his right hand and then wiped his face with both of
them.' 'Abdullah said, 'Don't you see that 'Umar was not happy with what
'Ammar said?' "
<P>
341. Al-A'mash added that Shaqiq said, "I was with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa
when Abu Musa said, 'Did you not hear what 'Ammar said to 'Umar? "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent me and you and I
was in <I>janaba</I> and rolled in the dust .We came to the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told him and he said,
'Like this would have been enough for you' and he wiped his face and hands
once."
<P>
342. It is related from 'Imran ibn Husayn al-Khuza'i that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw a man apart who who had
not prayed with everyone else. He said, "So-and-so! What stopped you praying
with everyone else?" He said, "I am on <I>janaba</I> and there is no water."
The Prophet said, "You must use the pure earth. That will be enough for you."
