Book of Supplications</BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><P>The words of the Almighty, "And your Lord said<I>, 'Call on Me and I willanswer you. Those who who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hellabject.'"</I> (40:60)<P><P><B>I. Every Prophet has a supplication which is answered</B><P>5945. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Every Prophet has a supplicationwhich is answered. I want to keep my supplication as intercession for mycommunity in the Next World."<P>5946. Anas related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Every Prophet will ask for something," or he said, "Every Prophethas a supplication which he makes which will be answered. I have made mysupplication intercession for my community on the Day of Rising."<P><P><B>II. The best way of asking &nbsp;for forgiveness</B><P>The words of the Almighty,<I> "Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Truly He isEndlessly Forgiving. He will send heaven down on you in abundant rain andreinforce you with more wealth and sons, and grant you gardens and grantyou waterways." </I>(71:10-12)<P><I>"Those who, when they act indecently or wrong themselves, remember Allahand ask forgiveness for their bad actions &#150; and who can forgive badactions except Allah &#150; and do not knowingly persist in what they weredoing." </I>(3:135)<P>5947. Bushayr ibn Ka'b al-'Adawi related from Shaddad ibn Aws that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The master of prayers forforgiveness is to say, 'O Allah, You are my Lord. There is no god but You,You created me and I am Your slave. I observe Your covenant and promise asmuch as I can. I seek refuge with You from the evil of what I have done,I acknowledge Your blessing to me and I acknowledge my wrong action to You,so forgive me. None forgives wrong actions but You.' Whoever says it in theday with certainty in it and dies on that day before the evening will beone of the people of the Garden. Whoever says it in the night with certaintyin it and dies on that before morning will be one of the people of the Garden.'"<P><P><B>III. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asking forgivenessboth day and night</B><P>5948. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that Abu Hurayra heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "By Allah, I askforgiveness of Allah and I turn in repentance to Him more than seventy timesa day."<P><P><B>IV. Repentance</B><P>Qatada said, <I>"Turn in sincere repentance to Allah" </I>(66:8) means trueand faithful.<P>5949. Al-Harith ibn Suwayd related: "'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud related two<I>hadiths</I> to me. One of them was from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and the other from himself. He said, 'A believer seeshis wrong actions as if he were sitting under a mountain which he fears willfall on him. The impious person sees his wrong actions like flies passingover his nose and he does this. (Abu Shihab said with his hand in front ofhis nose.) Then he said, 'Allah is happier with the repentance of the slavethan a man who camps in a place in which he might be killed. He has withhim his camel with his food and water. He puts his head down and goes tosleep. He wakes up and his camel is gone. The heat and thirst are severefor him or whatever Allah wishes for him. He says, "I will go back to myplace." He goes back and falls asleep and then lifts his head and his camelis with him.'"<P>Abu 'Awana corroborated it as did Jarir from al-A'mash.<P>'Umara related that he heard al-Harith...<P>It is related from Ibrahim at-Taymi from al-Harith ibn Suwayd.<P>It is related from 'Umara from al-Aswad from 'Abdullah. It is related fromIbrahim at-Taymi from al-Harith ibn Suwayd from 'Abdullah.<P>5950. Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said...<P>Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah is happier with repentance ofHis slave than one of you who loses his camel in the desert and then he comeson his camel."<P><P><B>V. Lying on the right side</B><P>5951. 'Urwa related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, prayed eleven r<I>ak'ats </I>every night. When dawn came,he prayed two quick rak'ats and the lay down on his right side until themu'adhdhin came and gave the <I>adhan</I>.<P><P><B>VI. Going to sleep in <I>wudu'</I></B><P>5952. Sa'd ibn 'Ubayd said that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib had related to him, "TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told me, 'Wheneveryou go to bed, do <I>wudu' </I>as you do <I>wudu' </I>for the prayer andthen lie down on your right side. Then say, "O Allah, I have surrenderedmyself to You, entrusted my affair to You and relied on You in hope and fearof You. There is no refuge nor rescue from You except in You. O Allah, Ihave believed in Your Book which You sent down and in Your Prophet whom Yousent." If you die that night, then you will be in a state of pure human nature,i.e. Islam. Make that the last of the words that you utter.' I repeated thisand when I reached, 'Your Messenger whom You sent' [instead of the Prophet],he said, 'No - "Your Prophet whom You sent."'"<P><P><B>VII. What one says when going to sleep</B><P>5953. Rib'i ibn Hirash related that Hudhayfa ibn al-Yaman said, "When theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to his bed, he said,'In Your Name I die and live.' When he got up, he said, 'Praise be to Allahwho gave us life after He made us die, and to Him is the resurrection.'"<P><I>"Nunshiruha" </I>(2:259) means "We bring them out."<P>5954. Abu Ishaq related that he heard from al-Bara' ibn 'Azib that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded a man...<P>Abu Ishaq al-Hamdani related that he heard from al-Bara' ibn 'Azib that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded a man, "Whenyou want to go bed, say, 'O Allah, I have surrendered my self to you andI have entrusted my affair to You. I have turned my face to You and I havesought refuge in You out of desire for You and terror of You. There is norefuge and no place of safety except to You. I have believed in Your Bookwhich You sent down and Your Prophet whom You send.' If you die. you willdie on the <I>fitra</I> (natural form)."<P><P><B>VIII. Putting the right hand under the right cheek</B><P>5955. Rib'i related that Hudhayfa said, "When the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, went to bed at night, he would place his hand underhis cheek and then say, 'O Allah, in Your Name I die and live.' When he wokeup, he would say, 'Praise be to Allah who gave us life after He made us die,and to Him is the resurrection.'"<P><P><B>IX. Sleeping on the right side</B><P>5956. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "When the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, went to his bed, he lay down on hisright side and then said, 'O Allah, I have surrendered my self to You, turnedmy face to You, entrusted my affair to You, and sought refuge in You in hopeand fear of You. There is no refuge and no place of safety except to You.I have believed in Your Book which You sent down.' The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever says and then diesthat night, dies in the natural form."<P><I>"istarhabuhum" </I>(7:116) comes from <I>rahba</I>. <I>Malakut</I> (6:75)means kingdom. An example is <I>rahabut</I> is better than <I>rahamut</I>,meaning "to inspire terror is better than being pitied."<P><P><B>X. Supplication when one wakes up at night</B><P>5957. Kurayb related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I spent the night with Maymuna.The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and went fora call of nature and washed his hands and face and then went to sleep. Thenhe got up, went to the waterskin, opened its mouth and then did a quick butcomplete wudu', not using a lot of water while doing it properly. He prayed.I got up and stood straight? not wanting for him to see that I was observinghim. I did wudu'. He stood up to pray and I stood to the left of him. Hetook hold of my ear and moved me to his right side. He prayed a full thirteenrak'ats and then lay down and slept until he blew air as he used to do whenhe slept. Bilal gave the <I>adhan</I> for the prayer. He prayed without doingwudu'. He used to say in his supplication, 'O Allah, put light in my heartand alight above me, a light behind me, a light in front of me and a lightbehind me. Appoint alight for me.'"<P>Kurayb said, "There were another seven words. I met a man from the descendantsof al-'Abbas and he related them to me, mentioning, 'my sinews, my blood,my hair, and my skin and he mentioned two other things."<P>5958. Tawus related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, got up at night to perform <I>tahajjud</I>, he wouldsay, 'O Allah, You have praise. You are the light of the heavens and theearth and everyone in them. Yours is the praise. You are the sustainer ofthe heavens and the earth and everyone in them. Yours is the praise. Youare the Truth. Your promise is true. Your words are true. The meeting withYou is true. The Garden is true and the Fire is true. The Prophets are trueand Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace is true. The Hour istrue. O Allah, I have submitted to You, I have put my trust in You and Ihave believed in You and to You I turn. I argue by You and take You asarbitrator. Forgive me my past and future wrong actions and what I keep secretand what I make known. You are the One who puts forward and defers. Thereis no god but You - or there is no god other than You.'"<P><P><B>XI. Saying the <I>takbir</I> and "Glory be to Allah" when going to sleep</B><P>5959. Ibn Abi Layla related from 'Ali that Fatima, peace be upon both ofthem, complained to what she got on her hands from the millstone. She wentto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and asked him fora servant. She did not find him there and mentioned that to 'A'isha. Whenhe came, she informed him. He said, "He came to us when we had gone to ourbed. I went to stand and said, 'Stay where you are.' He sat between us sothat I felt the coolness of his feet on my chest. He said, 'Shall I showyou what is better for you than a servant? When you go to your bed or taketo your beds, say the takbir 33 times, 'Glory be to Allah' 33 times and 'Praisebe to Allah' 33 times. This is better for you than a servant.'<P>Ibn Sirin said, "'Glory be to Allah' is 34."<P><P><B>XII. Seeking refuge with Allah and recitation when going to bed</B><P>5960. 'Urwa related from 'A'isha that when the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, went to bed, he blew on his hands and recitedthe refuge verses and then wiped his body with them.<P>5961. Abu Sa'id al-Maqburi related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When one of you goes to his bed,he should dust off his bed with the inside of his waist-wrapper. He doesnot know what has been there after him. Then he should say, 'In my Lord,my Lord, I have laid down my side and by You I will lift it up. If you keepmy self, have mercy on it. If You release it, then preserve it as You preserveYour righteous slaves."<P>Abu Damra and Isma'il ibn Zakariyya corroborated it from 'Ubaydullah. Yahyaand Bishr related from 'Ubaydullah from Sa'id from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>Another isnad from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>XIII. Supplication in the middle of the night</B><P>5962. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related from Abu Hurayra that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Every night, whena third of the night remains, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, descends tothe lowest heaven saying, 'Is there anyone calling on Me that I may answerhim? Is there anyone asking anything of Me that I may give it to him? Isthere anyone asking forgiveness of Me that I may forgive him?"<P><P><B>XIV. Supplication when going to the lavatory</B><P>5963. 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn Suhayb related that Anas ibn Malik said, "When theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered the lavatory, hewould say, 'O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the foul and foul things.'"<P><P><B>XV. What to say in the morning</B><P>5964. Bushayr ibn Ka'b related from Shaddad ibn Aws that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The master of asking forgivenessis to say, 'O Allah, You are my Lord. There is no god but You, You createdme and I am Your slave. I observe Your covenant and promise as much as Ican. I seek refuge with You from the evil of what I have done, I acknowledgeYour blessing to me and I acknowledge my wrong action to You, so forgiveme. None forgives wrong actions but You. I seek refuge with You from whatI have done.' Whoever says it in the night and dies, will enter the Garden(or 'is one of the people of the Garden'.) Whoever says it the day and dieson that before night .. with the like."<P>5965. Rib'i ibn Hirash related that Hudhayfa said, "When the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, went to his bed, he said, 'In Your Name,O Allah, I die and live.' When he got up, he said, 'Praise be to Allah whogave us life after He made us die, and to Him is the resurrection.'"<P>5966. Kharasha ibn al-Hurr related that Abu Dharr said, "When the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to bed at night, he would say,'O Allah, in Your Name I die and live.' When he got up, 'he said, 'Praisebe to Allah who gave us life after He made us die, and to Him is theresurrection.'"<P><P><B>XVI. Supplication during the prayer</B><P>5967. 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar related that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq said to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Teach me a supplication which Ican make in my prayer." He said, "Say: 'O Allah, I have greatly wronged myselfand none forgives wrong actions except You, so grant me Your forgivenessand be merciful to me. You are the Forgiving, the Merciful."<P>Another isnad.<P>5968. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said that <I>"Neither say your prayer aloud,nor say it in a low tone" </I>(17:110) was revealed about supplication.<P>5969. Abu Wa'il related that 'Abdullah said, "We used to say in the prayer,'Peace be upon Allah. Peace be upon so-and-so.' The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, &nbsp;said to us one day, 'Allah is Peace. Whenone of you sits in the prayer, he should say, "Greetings belong to Allahand good words and prayers. Peace be upon you, O Prophet and the mercy ofAllah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon all the right-acting slavesof Allah.'" If he says that, it will cover every right-acting slave of Allahin the heavens and the earth. "I testify that there is no god but Allah andI testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger." Then he can choose anypraise he likes.'"<P><P><B>XVII. Supplication after the prayer</B><P>5970. Abu Salih related that Abu Hurayra said, "They said, 'The rich peoplehave gone off with the higher degrees and everlasting bliss.' He said, 'Howis that?' They said, 'They pray as we pray and do jihad as we do jihad, Theyspend out of their excess wealth, but we do not have any property.' He said,'Shall I tell you something which will enable you, if you take it on, tocatch up with those who have gone ahead of you and no one will be able tobring the like of what you bring except someone who does the same thing?After every pray say 'Subhana'llah' ten times, 'praise be to Allah' ten timesand the takbir ten times.'"<P>'Ubaydullah ibn 'Umar corroborated it from Sumayy.<P>Ibn 'Ajlan related it from Sumayy and Raja' ibn Haywa.<P>Jarir related it from 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn Rufay' from Abu Salih from Abu'd-Darda'.<P>Suhayl related it from his father from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace.<P>5971. It is related that Warrad, the client of al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said,"Al-Mughira wrote to Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say after the <I>taslim</I>of every prayer, 'There is no god but Allah alone with no partner. The kingdomand praise belong to Him and He has power over everything. O Allah, nonecan withhold what You give nor give what You withhold and the effort of someonewho exerts himself is of no avail against You.'"<P>Shu'ba said that Mansur said, "I heard al-Musayyab..."<P><P><B>XVIII. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Pray for them." </I>(9:103) andthe one who preferred to pray for his brother rather than for himself</B><P>Abu Musa said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "O Allah, forgive 'Ubayd Abi 'Amir. O Allah, forgive the wrong actionsof 'Abdullah ibn Qays."<P>5972. Yazid ibn Abi 'Ubayd, the client of Salama, related that Salama ibnal-Akwa' said, "We went out to Khaybar with the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. A man of the people said, ''Amir, won't you letus hear some of your verses?' He dismounted and started to chant for them,saying:<P>'O Allah, were it not for You, we would not have been guided ...<P>"He mentioned more poetry, but I do not remember it. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'Who is this driver?' Theyanswered, ''Amir ibn al-Akwa'.' He said, 'May Allah have mercy on him!' Aman among the people said, 'Messenger of Allah, would that you let us enjoyhim longer!' When the people were formed in battle lines, they fought and'Amir struck his leg with his own sword and died. in the evening, they litmany fires. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,asked, 'What are these fires? For what are they being kindled?' They said,'For (cooking) domestic donkeys.' He said, 'Pour them out and break them.'A man said, 'O Messenger of Allah! Or can we pour out what is in them andwash them?' He said, 'Or that.'"<P>5973. 'Amr related, "I heard Ibn Abi Awfa say, "When a man brought<I>sadaqa</I> (i.e. <I>zakat</I>) to the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, the Prophet would day, 'O Prophet, bless the family ofso-and-so.' My father went to him and he said, 'O Allah, bless the familyof Abu Awfa!'"<P>5974. Qays said, "I heard Jarir say, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said to me, 'Will you not relieve me fromDhu'l-Khalasa?' It was an idol which they used to worship which was calledthe Yamani Ka'ba. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I am a man who cannot sitfirmly on horseback.' He struck me in my chest and said, 'O Allah, make himfirm and make him a guided guide.' " He said, 'I set out with fifty horsemenfrom Ahmas from my people. (Sufyan may I said, 'I went with a group of menfrom my people.') I went to it and burned it and then returned to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, Idid not come to you until I left it as if it was a scabby camel.' He madesupplication for Ahmas and its horsemen."<P>5975. Qatada said, "I heard Anas say, "Umm Sulayman said to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Anas is your servant.' He said,'O Allah, increase his wealth and children and bless him in what You givehim.'"<P>5976. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, heard a man reciting in the mosque and said, 'May Allahhave mercy on him. He reminded me of such-an-such an ayat which I had omittedin such-and-such a <I>sura</I>.'"<P>5977. Abu Wa'il related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, made a distribution and a man said, 'This is a divisionby which the Face of Allah is not desired.' I told the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and he became so angry that I saw it in hisface. He said, 'May Allah have mercy on Musa. He was injured by worse thanthis and was steadfast.'"<P><P><B>XIX. What is disliked of using rhymed prose (<I>saj'</I>) insupplication</B><P>5978. 'Ikrima related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Speak to the people once everyweek. If you will not, then three times. If you want to do it more, thenonly three times. Do not make people bored with this Qur'an. If you shouldhappen to come to some people who are engaged in some conversation, I donot want you to preach to them and interrupt their conversation and therebycause them to become bored. Rather you should be silent. When they ask you,then talk to them when they desire it. Look out for saj' in supplicationand avoid it. I saw that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and his Companions did not do that." He meant that theyonly avoided doing that.<P><P><B>XX. Be firm in asking. None can force Him.</B><P>5979. 'Abdu'l-'Aziz related from Anas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "When one of you makes a supplication,he should be firm in asking and should not say, 'O Allah, if You wish, giveto me.' No one can force him."<P>5980. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you should say, 'O Allah,forgive me if You wish. O Allah, have mercy on me if You wish.' He shouldbe firm in asking. None can force Him."<P><P><B>XXI. The slave's supplication is answered as long as he does not becomeimpatient</B><P>5981. Abu 'Ubayd, the client of Ibn Azhar related from Abu Hurayra that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A personwill be answered as long as he does not become over-impatient, saying, 'Icalled on my Lord and He did not answer me.'"<P><P><B>XXII. Raising the hands in supplication</B><P>Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, made supplication and then raised his hands and I could see the whiteof his armpits."<P>Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, raisedhis hands and said, 'O Allah, I am innocent of what Khalid has done.'"<P>Yahya ibn Sa'id and Sharik said that they heard Anas report about the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "He raised his hands until I couldsee the whiteness of his armpits."<P><P><B>XXIII. Supplication while not facing qibla</B><P>5982. Qatada related that Anas said, "While the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was giving a <I>khutba</I> on Friday, a man stoodup and said, 'Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to give us rain!' The skybecame overcast and we had rain so that a man should barely reach his house.We continued to have rain until the following Friday. Then that man or anotherstood up and said, 'Pray to Allah to remove it from us. We have been inundated.'He said, 'O Allah, around us but not on us.' The clouds began to disperseand separated around Madina and the rain did not fall on the people of Madina."<P><P><B>XXIV. Supplication while facing qibla</B><P>5983. 'Abbad ibn Tamim related that 'Abdullah ibn Zayd said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to this place of prayerand made supplication, praying for rain. Then he faced the qibla and reversedhis cloak."<P><P><B>XXV. The supplication of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, for his servant to have a long life and great wealth</B><P>5984. Qatada related that Anas said, "My mother said, 'Messenger of Allah,Anas is your servant. Pray to Allah for him. He said, 'O Allah, make himhave a lot of wealth and children, and bless him in what You give to him.'"<P><P><B>XXVI. Invocation in time of distress</B><P>5985. Abu'l-'Aliyya related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, used to make supplication in time of distress,saying, 'There is no god but Allah, the Immense the Forbearing. There isno god but Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and Lord of theMighty Throne.'"<P><IMG SRC="5985.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="Middle"><P>5986. Abu'l-'Aliyya related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "During distress, the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, 'There isno god but Allah, the Lord of the Immense Throne. There is no god but Allah,the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth and the Lord of the NobleThrone.'"<P><IMG SRC="5986.jpg" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="75" ALIGN="Middle"><P>The like of it is related from Qatada.<P><P><B>XXVII. Seeking refuge with Allah from the difficulty of affliction</B><P>5987. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, used to seek refuge from the hardshipof affliction, being overtaken by wretchedness, an evil final decree, andthe gloating of enemies."<P>Sufyan said, "The <I>hadith</I> contained three and I added one, but I donot know which one it was."<P><P><B>XXVIII. The supplication of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, "O Allah, the Highest Companion" (cf. 4:69)</B><P>5988. Ibn Shihab related from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab and 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayramong the men of the people of knowledge that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say when he was healthy,''No Prophet dies until he sees his seat in the Garden, and then is madeto live or is given a choice.' When he was ill and near death and his headwas on my thigh he fainted and when he recovered, his eyes were fixed onthe roof of the house and then he said, 'O Allah, with the Highest Companion.'I said, 'Then he is not going to choose us!' and I knew that it was whathe had said when he was healthy." She said, "Those were the last words heuttered: 'O Allah, with the Highest Companion.'"<P><P><B>XXIX. Supplication for death and life</B><P>5989. Isma'il related that Qays said, "I went to Khabbab when he had beencauterised seven times and he said, 'If it had not been that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade us to pray fordeath, I would have prayed for it.'"<P>Isma'il related that Qays said, "I went to Khabbab when he had been cauterisedseven times on his abdomen and heard him say, 'If it had not been that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade us to pray fordeath, I would have prayed for it.'"<P>5990.

Be gentle and bewareof harshness and coarseness." She said, "Did you not hear what they said?"He said, "And did you not hear what I said. I returned it to them, What Iinvoked against them will be answered and what they invoked against me willnot be answered."<P><P><B>LXIII. Saying "Amen"</B><P>6039. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the Imam says 'Amen', say'Amen'. If someone's 'Amen' coincides with that of the angels, he will beforgiven his past wrong actions."<P><P><B>LXIV. The excellence of "There is no god but Allah"</B><P>6040. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever says, 'There is no godbut Allah alone with no partner. He has the kingdom and He has the praiseand He has power over everything,' a hundred times a day has the equivalentof freeing ten slaves and a hundred good deeds are written for him and ahundred evil deeds are effaced from him, and he had protection from Shaytanon that day of his until evening. No more will bring better than what hehas brought except someone who had done more than that."<P>6041. Abu Ishaq reported that 'Amr ibn Maymun said, "Whoever says it tentimes is like someone who has freed a slave from the descendants of Isma'il.<P>Ash-Sha'bi related the like of it from Rabi' ibn Khuthaym. "I said to ar-Rabi',"Who did you hear it from?' He answered, 'From 'Amr ibn Maymun.' I went to'Amr ibn Maymun and said, 'Who did you hear it from?' He said, 'From IbnAbi Layla.' I went to Ibn Abi Layla and said, 'Who did you hear it from?'He said, 'From Abu Ayyub al-Ansari who related it from the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace.'"<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from 'Amr ibn Maymun from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Laylafrom Abu Ayyub from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>Another isnad from 'Amir from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Layla from Abu Ayyubfrom the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Isma'il said fromAsh-Sha'bi from ar-Rabi'.<P>Another isnad from Hilal ibn Yasaf from ar-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym and 'Amr ibnMaymun from Ibn Mas'ud.<P>Al-A'mash and Husayn from Hilal from ar-Rabi' from 'Abdullah.<P>Abu Muhammad al-Hadrami related it from Abu Ayyub from the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, "like someone who has freed a slave from thedescendants of Isma'il."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that the sound version is that of 'Amr.<P><P><B>LXV. The excellence of glorification (<I>tasbih</I>)</B><P>6042. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra &#163; that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone says, 'Glory beto Allah and by His praise' a hundred times a day, his wrong actions willfall away, even if they are like the froth of the sea.'"<P>6043. Abu Zur'a related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "There are two which are light on the tongueand heavy in the balance and beloved to the All-Merciful: 'Glory be to Allah,the Immense' and 'Glory be to Allah and by His praise.'"<P><P><B>LXVI. The excellence of remembering Allah Almighty</B><P>6044. Abu Bursa related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "The likeness of someone who remembers his Lordand the likeness of someone who does not remember his Lord is like the livingand the dead."<P>6045. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah has angels who travel thehighways and by-ways seeking out the people of dhikr. When they find peopleremembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, they call out to one another,'Come to what you hunger for!' and they enfold them with their wings stretchingup to the lowest heaven. Their Lord - who knows best - asks them, 'What areMy slaves saying?' They say, 'They are glorifying You, proclaiming Yourgreatness, praising You and magnifying You.' He says, 'Have they seen Me?'They say, 'No, by Allah, they have not seen You.' He says, 'How would itbe if they were to see Me?' [extra 'He said's deleted] They say, 'If theywere to see You, they would worship You even more intensely and magnify Youeven more intensely and glorify You even more intensely.' He says, 'Whatare they asking for?' They say, 'They are asking You for the Garden.' Hesays, 'Have they seen it?' They say, 'No, by Allah, O Lord, they have notseen it.'" He says, 'How would it be if they were to see it?' They say, 'Ifthey were to see it, they would yearn for it even more strongly and seekit even more assiduously and would have an even greater desire for it.' Hesays, 'What are they seeking refuge from?' 'They are seeking refuge fromthe Fire.' He says, 'Have they seen it?' He says, 'How would it be if theywere to see it?' They say, 'If they were to see it, they would flee fromit even harder and have an even greater fear of it.' He says, 'I testifyto you that I have forgiven them.' One of angels says, 'Among them is so-and-sowho is not one of them. He came to get something he needed.' He says, 'Theyare sitting and the one sitting with them will not be disappointed.'"<P>Shu'ba related it from al-A'mash and does not have it marfu'.<P>Suhayl related it from his father from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>LXVII. The words, "There is no power nor strength except by Allah"</B><P>6046. Abu 'Uthman related that Ab&uuml; Musa al-Ash'ari said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, started to go up a slope (or hill).When a man was on top of it, he shouted in a loud voice, 'There is no godbut Allah! Allah is greater!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was on his mule and said, 'You are not calling someonewho is deaf or absent.' Then he said, 'Abu Musa (or 'Abdullah), Shall I directyou to a word which is one of the treasures of the Garden?' I said, 'Yesindeed!' He said, 'There is no power nor strength except by Allah.'"<P><P><B>LXVIII. Allah has ninety-names [lit. a hundred less one]</B><P>6047. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra, "Allah has ninety-nine names, ahundred less one. Anyone who knows them all will enter the Garden. He isodd and loves the odd."<P><P><B>LXVIII. Admonishment at different times</B><P>6048. It is related that Shaqiq said, "We were waiting for 'Abdullah whenYazid ibn Mu'awiya came. We said, 'Will you not sit down?' 'No,' he said,'but I go in and let your companion come out to you. Otherwise, I will comeand sit.' 'Abdullah ,came out, holding the hand of Yazid and stood over andsaid, 'I have been informed that you are here. But what prevents me fromcoming out to you is that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, used to regularly preach to us, disliking for us to becomebored.'"<P>  <HR><P ALIGN=Center><B><BIG><A HREF="bukhcont.html">Return to Contents</A></BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><BIG><B><A HREF="index.html">Return to Home Page</A></B></BIG><P></BODY></HTML>
