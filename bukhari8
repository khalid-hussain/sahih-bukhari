<B><BIG><A NAME="16">Chapter 16. The Description of the
Prayer</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: The obligation to say the <I>takbir</I> and the beginning of the
prayer</B>
<P>
699. It is related from Anas ibn Malik al-Ansari, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rode a horse and his right side
was grazed." Anas said, "On that day he did one of the prayers sitting down,
and we prayed behind him sitting down. When he had said the <I>taslim</I>,
he said, 'The Imam is appointed to be followed. If he prays standing, then
pray standing, and when he goes into <I>ruku'</I>, go into<I> ruku</I>',
and when he rises, rise, and when he prostrates, prostrate, and when he says,
"Allah hears whoever praises him," say, "Our Lord, praise belongs to you."
<P>
700. As 699 but with "When he says the <I>takbir</I>, say the <I>takbir</I>
and when he goes into <I>sajda</I>, you go into <I>sajda</I>."
<P>
701. As 699 from "The Imam was made..." and at the end, "When he prays sitting
down, then all pray sitting down."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Raising both hands when saying the first <I>takbir</I> at the very
beginning of the prayer</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#17">702</A>. It is related from Salim ibn 'Abdullah from
his father that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, used to raise his hands level with his shoulders when he began the
prayer and when he said the <I>takbir</I> for <I>ruku'</I>. When he raised
his head from <I>ruku'</I>, he also raised them like that and said, "Allah
hears whoever praises him. Our Lord, all praise belongs to you." He did not
do that in <I>sujud</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Raising the hands when saying the <I>takbir</I>, when bowing and
when raising the head</B>
<P>
703. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I used to see that when
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up
to pray he would raise his hands level with his shoulders. He would also
do that when he said the <I>takbir</I> for<I> ruku' </I>and when he raised
his head from <I>ruku'</I> as he said, 'Allah hears whoever praises him.'
He did not do it in <I>sajda</I>."
<P>
704. It is related that Abu Qilaba saw Malik ibn al-Huwayrith praying - he
said the <I>takbir</I> and raised his hands. When he went to do<I> ruku'
</I>he raised his hands. When he raised his head from <I>ruku'</I>, he raised
his hands. He related that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, had done the same as that.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Up to what height should the hands be raised? </B>
<P>
Abu Humayd said to his companions, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, raised his hands up to the level of his shoulders."
<P>
705. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I saw the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, begin the prayer with the <I>takbir</I>.
As he said the <I>takbir</I>, he raised his hands until they were level with
his shoulders. When he did the <I>takbir</I> fo<I>r ruku'</I>, he did the
same. When he said, 'Allah hears whoever praises him,' he did the same and
said, 'Our Lord, all praise belongs to you.' He did not do it when he went
into <I>sajda</I> nor when he raised his head from <I>sajda</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Raising the hands when coming up after the first two
<I>rak'ats</I></B>
<P>
706. It is related from Nafi' that when Ibn 'Umar began the prayer, he said
the <I>takbir</I> and raised his hands. When he did ruku', he raised his
hands. When he said, "Allah hears whoever praises him," he raised his hands.
When he got up after two <I>rak'ats</I>, he raised his hands. Ibn 'Umar referred
that right back up to the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
Another <I>isnad</I> to Ibn 'Umar.
<P>
A shortened version is related from Ayyub and Musa ibn 'Uqba.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Placing the right hand over the left</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t50">707</A>. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "The
people were told that each man should should place his right hand over his
left forearm in the prayer." (Abu Hazim said, "I only know that that went
back to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.) (Isma'il said,
"<I>Yunma</I>" and did not say "<I>yanmi</I>".)
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Humility in the prayer</B>
<P>
708. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "You see me facing forward here but,
by Allah, your<I> ruku</I>' and humility is not hidden from me. I can see
you behind my back."
<P>
709. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Do your <I>ruku' </I>and <I>sajda</I> correctly
for, by Allah, I can see you behind me (or he might have said - behind my
back) when you do <I>ruku' </I>and go into <I>sajda</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: What should be said after the <I>takbir</I></B>
<P>
710. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, Abu Bakr and 'Umar used to open the prayer with, 'Praise belongs
to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.' "
<P>
711. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used pause in silence between the
<I>takbir</I> and the recitation (I think he said it was a short pause).
I said, 'By my father and mother, Messenger of Allah, what do you say when
you are silent between the <I>takbir</I> and the recitation?' He said, 'I
say, "O Allah, put as great a distance between me and my wrong actions as
You have put between the east and the west. O Allah, cleanse me of wrong
actions as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. O Allah, wash away my wrong
actions with water, snow and hail."'"
<P>
712. It is related from Asma' bint Abi Bakr that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, prayed the Eclipse prayer and stood, staying standing
for a long time. Then he went into <I>ruku'</I>, making the<I> ruku'</I>
long. Then he stood back up, staying standing for a long time. Then he went
into<I> ruku</I>', making the <I>ruku' </I>long. Then he stood up again and
went into <I>sajda</I>, making the <I>sajda</I> long. Then he sat back and
went into <I>sajda</I> again, making the <I>sajda</I> long. Then he stood
up and stayed standing for a long time. Then he went into <I>ruku'</I>, making
the<I> ruku'</I> long. Then he stood back up, staying standing for a long
time. Then he went into <I>ruku'</I>, making the <I>ruku' </I>long. Then
he stood back up and went into <I>sajda</I>, making the <I>sajda</I> long.
Then he sat back up and then he went into <I>sajda</I>, making the
<I>sajda</I> long. Then he ended the prayer and said, "The Garden drew so
close to me that if I had dared to do so, I could have picked one of its
bunches for you. And the Fire also drew so close to me that I said, 'O Lord,
am I going to be one of them?' Suddenly there was a woman there (I think
that he said a cat was mauling her). I said, 'What is happening to her?'
They said, 'She shut the cat up until it died of hunger. She did not feed
it nor let it loose to eat by itself.'" (Nafi' said, "I think that he said,
'Eat grass or herbs.'")
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Raising the eyes to look at the Imam during the prayer</B>
<P>
'A'isha said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said
about the Eclipse Prayer, "I saw Jahannam, one part of it crashing against
the other. That was when you saw me stepping back."
<P>
713. It is related that Abu Ma'mar said, "We said to Khabbab, 'Did the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, use to recite in
<I>Dhuhr</I> and<I> 'Asr</I>?' He said, 'Yes.' We said, 'How do you know
that?' He said, 'By the movement of his beard.'"
<P>
714. It is related from al-Bara' (and al-Bara' was not a liar) that when
they prayed with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
he raised his head from <I>ruku'</I>, they remained standing until they saw
him go into <I>sajda</I>.
<P>
715. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said, "There was an eclipse
of the sun in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and he prayed. They said, 'Messenger of Allah, we saw you
reach out for something while you were standing here and then we saw you
step back.' He said, 'I saw the Garden and I reached out for a bunch of grapes
from it, and if I had taken it, you would have been able to eat from it as
long this world lasts.' "
<P>
716. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, led us in the prayer and then ascended the minbar,
pointing with both hands towards the mosque <I>qibla</I>. Then he said, 'Just
now as I was praying, I saw the Garden and the Fire displayed on this
<I>qibla</I> wall. I have never seen any good or evil like today' three times."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Raising ones eyes towards heaven in the prayer</B>
<P>
717. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Why on earth do some people raise their eyes
towards heaven during their prayer?' His words on this subject grew stronger
until he finally said, 'They should stop doing it or their eyesight will
be taken away.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Looking around in the prayer</B>
<P>
718. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I asked the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, about looking around in the prayer and
he said, 'It is one of Shaytan's ways of making off with people's prayers.'
"
<P>
719. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, prayed wearing a<I> khamisa</I> (blanket) which had a design
on it and said, "The design on this distracted me. Take it to Abu Jahm and
bring me an <I>inbijaniya</I> (a plain garment)."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Is it permitted to look round in the prayer if something happens
or if you see something such as spittle in the <I>qibla</I></B>
<P>
Sahl said, "Abu Bakr looked round and saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace."
<P>
720. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, saw some phlegm in the <I>qibla</I> of the mosque while
he was leading the people in the prayer and scraped it off. Then, when he
finished the prayer, he said, "When anyone does the prayer, Allah is in front
of him, so none of you should spit in front of you during the prayer."
<P>
This is related from Nafi'.
<P>
721. It is related that Anas said, "While the Muslims were doing the Fajr
prayer, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
suddenly appeared before them, lifting the curtain of 'A'isha's room. He
saw them standing in rows and smiled joyfully. Abu Bakr fell back to the
first row, thinking that he wanted to come out and the Muslims were put to
the test, being about to abandon the prayer, but he indicated to them, 'Complete
your prayer.' He let the curtain drop and it was at the end of that day that
he died."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: The obligation for both the Imam and those following to recite in
all the prayers, whether resident or travelling, whether it is out loud or
silent.</B>
<P>
722. It is related that Jabir ibn Samura said, "The people of Kufa complained
about Sa'd to 'Umar and he dismissed him and appointed 'Ammar over them.
One of their complaints was that he did not do the prayer correctly. 'Umar
sent to him and said, 'Abu Ishaq! These people claim that you do not do the
prayer correctly.' Abu Ishaq said, 'By Allah, I prayed with them the prayer
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, without
diminishing it. When I prayed <I>'Isha' </I>I made the first tw<I>o rak'ats</I>
long and the last two short.' 'Umar said, 'That is what one would have expected
of you, Abu Ishaq.' He sent a couple men with him to Kufa to ask the people
of Kufa about him and they asked about him in every mosque they visited.
Everyone praised his correctness until they came to the mosque of the Banu
'Abs. One of their men called Usama ibn Qatada with the kunya of Abu Sa'da,
stood up and said, 'Since you ask us under oath, Sa'd did not himself go
out on military expeditions, he did not divide the booty equally nor was
he just in giving judgement.' Sa'd said, 'By Allah, I pray for three things.
O Allah, if this slave of Yours is a liar, and has got up just to show off,
then make him live long, be poor long and expose him to trials.' After that
whenever he was asked, the man would say, 'I am an old man tested and afflicted
by the prayer of Sa'd.'"
<P>
'Abdu'l-Malik said, "I saw him later and his eyebrows were hanging over his
eyes due to old age. He would accost young girls in the streets and pinch
them."
<P>
723. It is related from 'Ubada ibn as-Samit that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no prayer for anyone
who does not recite the <I>Fatiha</I> of the Book."
<P>
724. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, entered the mosque and a man entered and prayed.
He greeted the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who returned
the greeting and said, 'Go and back and pray. You have not prayed.' He went
back and prayed as he had prayed before. Then he came and greeted the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,who said three times, 'Go back and
pray for you have not prayed.' He said, 'By the One who sent you with the
truth, I cannot do any better than that, so teach me.' He said, 'When you
stand for the prayer, say the <I>takbir</I> and then recite something you
know well from the Qur'an and then do<I> ruku' </I>until you are at rest
in your <I>ruku'</I> . Then stand back up until you are completely upright.
Then go into <I>sajda</I> until you are at rest in your <I>sajda</I>. Then
sit back until you are at rest in the sitting position. Do that throughout
all of your prayer.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Recitation in <I>Dhuhr</I></B>
<P>
725. It is related that Sa'd said, "I prayed the prayer of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,with them in the two afternoon
prayers (<I>Dhuhr</I> and <I>'Asr</I>) and did not diminish it. I made the
first two<I> rak'ats</I> long and the last two short." 'Umar said, "That
is what one would have expected of you."
<P>
It is related that Abu Qatada said, "In the first two<I> rak'ats</I> of the
<I>Dhuhr</I> prayer, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to recite the <I>Fatiha</I> of the Book and two <I>suras</I>, longer
in the first and shorter in the second, and at times the <I>ayat</I> could
be heard. In <I>'Asr</I>, he would recite the <I>Fatiha</I> of the Book and
two <I>suras</I>. In <I>Subh</I>, he used to make the first <I>rak'at</I>
long and the second short."
<P>
726. It is related that Abu Ma'rar said, "We asked Khabbab whether the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to recite in the prayers of
<I>Dhuhr</I> an<I>d 'Asr</I>. He said, 'Yes.' We said, 'How do you know that?'
He said, 'From the movement of his beard.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Recitation in<I> 'Asr</I></B>
<P>
727. It is related that Abu Ma'mar said, "We said to Khabbab ibn al-Aratt,
'Did the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, use
to recite in <I>Dhuhr</I> and <I>'Asr</I>?' He said, 'Yes.' We said, 'How
do you know that?' He said, 'By the movement of his beard.' "
<P>
728. It is related that Abu Qatada's father said, "In the two <I>rak'ats
</I>of the <I>Dhuhr</I> and <I>'Asr </I>prayers, the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to recite the <I>Fatiha</I> of the Book and
two <I>suras</I>, and at times the <I>ayat</I> could be heard."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Recitation in <I>Maghrib</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#25">729</A>. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that Umm
al-Fadl heard him while he was reciting <I>"Wa'l-mursalati 'urfan"</I> (77)
and said, "My son, by Allah, your recitation reminded me that this sura was
the last one I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, reciting in the <I>Maghrib</I> prayer."
<P>
730. It is related that Marwan ibn al-Hakam said, "Zayd ibn Thabit said to
me, 'Why do you recite short <I>suras</I> in <I>Maghrib</I> when I heard
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reciting the longer
of the two long ones."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Reciting aloud in the Maghrib prayer</B>

<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Reciting aloud in the <I>'Isha' </I>prayer</B>
<P>
732. It is related that Abu Rafi' said, "I prayed 'Atama with Abu Hurayra
and he recited, <I>'Idha's-sama'u'inshaqqat' </I>(84) and he went into
<I>sajda</I>. I questioned him and he said, 'I went into <I>sajda</I> behind
Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I will continue
to do <I>sajda</I> in it until I meet him.'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#28">733</A>. It is related from al-Bara' that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on a journey he recited<I> at-Tin
</I>(95) in one of the two <I>rak'ats</I> of <I>'Isha'</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Recitation of a <I>sajda</I> in the 'Isha' prayer</B>
<P>
734. It is related that Abu Rafi' said, "I prayed <I>'Atama </I>with Abu
Hurayra and he recited, <I>'Idha's-sama'u'inshaqqat' </I>(84) and he went
into <I>sajda</I>. I questioned him and he said, 'I went into <I>sajda</I>
behind Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I will continue
to do <I>sajda</I> in it until I meet him.'"
<P>
<P>

him and grant him peace, reciting<I> 'Wa't-tini wa'z-zaytun'&nbsp;</I>(95)
in the <I>'Isha'</I> prayer and I have never heard anyone with a better voice
or better recitation than he had."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: Making the first two <I>rak'ats</I> long and the last two short</B>
<P>
736. It is related that Jabir ibn Samura said, "'Umar said to Sa'd, 'They
have complained about you regarding everything, even the prayer.' He said,
'I made the first two long and the last two short and I would never diminish
in any way my following of the prayer of the Messenger of Allah.' He said,
'You have spoken the truth. That is what one would have expected of you -
or what I would have expected of you.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: Recitation in <I>Fajr</I></B>
<P>
Umm Salama said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited
<I>at-Tur </I>(52)."
<P>
737. It is related that Sayyar ibn Salama said, "My father and I came to
Abu Barza al-Aslami and we asked him about the time of the prayers. He said,
'He used to pray the midday prayer when the sun began to decline. He prayed<I>
'Asr</I> at a time when a man could return to his house at the furthest part
of the city and the sun would still be still white. (I forgot what he said
about <I>Maghrib</I>.) The Prophet preferred to dela<I>y al-'Atama </I>until
a third of the night. He did not like sleeping before it or conversation
after it. He used to leave from the morning prayer when a man could recognise
the person sitting next to him and he would recite between sixty and a hundred
<I>ayats</I> in the two<I> rak'ats</I> or one of them."
<P>
738. It is related that Abu Hurayra was heard to say, "There is recitation
in every prayer and what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, made audible to us, we make audible to you. What he did
silently, we do silently. If you recite no more than the Umm al-Qur'an, that
is enough. If you do more, that is better."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: Reciting aloud in <I>Fajr</I></B>
<P>
Umm Salama said, "I was doing <I>tawaf</I> behind the people while the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was praying, reciting <I>at-Tur
</I>(52)."
<P>
739. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, set out with a group of his Companions, making for the
market of 'Ukaz. A barrier had been set up preventing the shaytans hearing
the news of the heavens and meteors were cast against them and they returned
to their people saying, 'There is a barrier preventing us hearing the news
of the heavens and meteors were cast against us.' They said, 'This thing
that has come between you and the the news of the heavens is something new.
Travel east and west in the earth and see what it is that has put a barrier
between you and the news of the heavens." Those who headed in the direction
of Tihama came across the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
who was at Nakhla on his way to the market of 'Ukaz. He was praying
<I>Fajr</I> with his Companions. When they heard the Qur'an they listened
carefully to it and said, 'By Allah, this is what has come between us and
the news of the heavens!' Then they returned to their people and said, 'Our
people!<I> We have heard a most amazing Recitation. It leads to right guidance
so we believe in it and will not associate anyone with our Lord.' S</I>o
Allah sent down on His Prophet<I>, 'Say: it has been revealed to me...'</I>
[sura 72] What the jinn had said was revealed to him."
<P>
740. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, recited aloud when he was ordered to and was silent
when he was ordered to be, <I>'And your Lord is not forgetful,'</I> (19;64)
and <I>'You have a good model in the Messenger of Allah.</I>' (33:21)"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: Reciting two <I>suras</I> in one<I> rak'at </I>or the last
<I>ayats</I> of a <I>sura</I>, or <I>suras</I> in reverse order or the beginning
of a <I>sura</I>.</B>
<P>
It is mentioned from 'Abdullah ibn as-Sa'ib that the prophet recited
<I>al-Mu'minun</I> (23) in <I>Subh</I> until he reached the part about Musa
and Harun or 'Isa when he started coughing and did<I> ruku'</I>. 'Umar recited
120 <I>ayats</I> from <I>al-Baqara </I>in the first <I>rak'at </I>and a sura
from the <I>Mathani</I> * in the second <I>rak'at</I>. Al-Ahnaf recited
<I>al-Kahf</I> (18) in the first and <I>Yusuf</I> (12) or <I>Yunus</I> (10)
in the second. It was mentioned that he had prayed <I>Subh</I> with those
<I>suras</I> in the presence of 'Umar. Ibn Mas'ud recited 40 <I>ayats</I>
of <I>al-Anfal </I>(8) and then a <I>sura</I> from the <I>Mufassal</I> in
the second <I>rak'at</I>. Qatada said that it was permitted for someone to
recite the same <I>sura</I> in both<I> rak'ats</I> or to repeat the same
<I>sura</I> in both<I> rak'ats</I> as they are all from the Book of Allah.
<P>
[*Here it means those <I>suras</I> which are less than a hundred
<I>ayats</I>.]
<P>
741. It is related that Anas said, "One of the men of the Ansar used to lead
the prayer in the mosque of Quba'. Every time he wanted to recite a
<I>sura</I> for them in the prayer, he would begin by reciting,<I> 'Qul
huwa'llahu ahad,'</I> (112) from beginning to end. Then he would recite another
<I>sura</I> after it. He used to do that in every <I>rak'at</I>. His companions
talked to him about this and said, 'You begin with this <I>sura</I> and then,
not thinking it enough, you recite another. You should either recite it on
its own or leave it and recite another.' He said, 'I will not abandon it.
If you want me to be your Imam on that basis I will do it. If you are averse
to that, I will leave you.' They thought that he was the best of them and
did not want anyone else to lead them. When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came to them, they told him about it and he said,
'So-and-so! What stops you doing what your companions tell you to? What has
moved you to cling to this <I>sura</I> in every <I>rak'at?</I>' He said,
'I love it.' He said, 'Your love for it has ensured your entrance to the
Garden.' "

and said, 'I recited the <I>Mufassal</I> at night in one<I> rak'at.</I>'
Ibn Mas'ud said, 'This is like the rattling off of poetry. I know that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to recite these same
<I>suras</I> in pairs.' He mentioned twenty <I>suras</I> from the
<I>Mufassal</I>, using two in every <I>rak'at</I>."

we might sometimes hear an <I>ayat</I>. He made the first<I> rak'at </I>longer

<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: The Imam saying "<I>Amin</I>" aloud</B>
<P>
'Ata' said, "'Amin' is a supplication." Ibn az-Zubayr and those behind him
used to say "<I>Amin</I>" until the mosque reverberated. Abu Hurayra used
to call out to the Imam, "Do not let me miss the '<I>Amin</I>'." Nafi' said,

say '<I>Amin</I>', for the past wrong actions of all those whose utterance
coincides with that of the angels are forgiven them."
<P>
Abu Salama corroborated it from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and Nu'aym al-Mujmir from Abu Hurayra.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXII: When someone does <I>ruku'</I> behind the prayer line</B>

I prayed behind 'Ali ibn Abi Talib. When he went into <I>sajda</I> he said
the <I>takbir</I> and when he raised his head, he said the <I>takbir</I>.
When he got up after two<I> rak'ats</I>, he said the <I>takbir</I>. When
he finished the prayer, 'Imran ibn Husayn took hold of my hand and said,
'This man reminded me of the prayer of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace,' or he said, 'He prayed the prayer of Muhammad with us.'"
<P>

is the <I>sunna</I> of Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!'"
<P>
[*<FONT COLOR="Navy">It is said that it was Abu Hurayra. 'Ikrima was the
slave of Ibn 'Abbas</FONT>.]
<P>
756. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up for the prayer, he said the
<I>takbir</I> when he stood up and the <I>takbir</I> when he did
<I>ruku'</I>. Then he said, 'Allah hears whoever praises him,' when his back
was straight after coming back from<I> ruku'</I>. Then as he was standing
he said, 'Our Lord, praise is yours.' ('Abdullah said, 'And praise is yours.')
Then he said the <I>takbir</I> when he went down and then the <I>takbir</I>
when he raised his head. Then he said the <I>takbir</I> when he went into
<I>sajda</I> and the <I>takbir</I> when he raised his head again. Then he

<P>
758. It is related that Zayd ibn Wuhayb said, "Hudhayfa saw a man who did
not fully complete the<I> ruku' </I>and <I>sajda</I> and said, 'You have
not prayed. If you died now, you would die having taken on something other
than the natural patterning (<I>fitra</I>) which Allah gave to Muhammad,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVIII: Keeping the back straight in <I>ruku'</I></B>
<P>
Abu Humayd said among his companions, "The Prophet did <I>ruku' </I>and bent

<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: The limit of correct <I>ruku' </I>is to be balanced and at rest.</B>
<P>
759. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The <I>ruku'</I> , the <I>sajda</I>,
the gap between the two <I>sajdas</I> and the rising from<I> ruku' </I>of
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace - but not his standing
and sitting - lasted about the same length of time."
<P>
760. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, entered the mosque and a man entered and prayed. He came
and greeted the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who returned
the greeting and said, 'Go and back and pray. You have not prayed.' He prayed
and came and greeted the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
who said three times, 'Go back and pray for you have not prayed.' He said,
'By the One who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than that,
so teach me.' He said, 'When you stand for the prayer, say the <I>takbir</I>
and then recite something you know well from the Qur'an and then do
<I>ruku'</I> until you are at rest in you<I>r ruku</I>' .Then stand back
up until you are completely upright. Then go into <I>sajda</I> until you
are at rest in your <I>sajda</I>. Then sit back until you are at rest in
the sitting position. Then go into <I>sajda</I> until you are at rest in
your <I>sajda</I>. Do that throughout all of your prayer.'"
<P>
<P>

<P>
761. It is related that 'A'isha said, "In his <I>ruku' </I>and <I>sajda</I>
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, 'Glory
be to You, O Allah, our Lord, and with Your praise. O Allah, forgive me!'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XLI: What the Imam and those behind him say when he lifts his head from
<I>ruku' </I></B>
<P>
762. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah hears whoever praises Him,' he would
say, 'Our Lord, and praise belongs to You.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said the <I>takbir</I> when he went into<I> ruku'</I>
and when he raised his head. When he stood up from the two <I>sajdas</I>,
he also said, 'Allah is Greater.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XLII: The excellence of saying, "O Allah, our Lord, praise belongs to
You."</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#50">763</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the Imam says,
'Allah hears whoever praises Him,' say, 'O Allah, our Lord, praise belongs
to You.' Anyone whose words coincide with those of the angels will be forgiven
his past wrong actions.' "
<P>
764. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "My prayer is very close to that
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." Abu Hurayra used
to say the <I>qunut</I> in the last<I> rak'at </I>of <I>Dhuhr</I>, <I>'Isha'
</I>and <I>Subh</I> after he had said, "Allah hears whoever praises Him."
he would pray for the believers and curse the unbelievers.
<P>
765. It is related that Anas said, "The <I>qunut</I> is in <I>Maghrib</I>
and <I>Fajr</I>."
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#qu25">766</A>. It is related that Rifa'a ibn Rafi' az-Zuraqi
said, "One day, when we were praying behind the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, as he raised his head from the <I>ruku'</I> he said,
'Allah hears whoever praises Him.' A man behind him said, 'Our Lord, praise
belongs to You, abundant, good and blessed praise.' When he finished, he
said, 'Who spoke?' The man said, 'I did.' The Prophet said, 'I saw some thirty
angels racing each other to be first to write it down.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIII: Coming to rest after raising the head from <I>ruku'</I></B>
<P>
Abu Humayd said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
raised his head, he stood upright until every vertebra had returned to its
place."
<P>
767. It is related that Thabit said, "Anas used to demonstrate the prayer
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to us and as he
was praying he used to stand there for so long after raising his head from<I>
ruku',</I> that we would think he had forgotten."
<P>
768. Al-Bara' said, "The<I> ruku'</I> of the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and his <I>sajda</I>, his standing after rising from<I>
ruku'</I> and his sitting between the two <I>sajdas</I> were all of about
the same length."
<P>
769. It is related that Abu Qilaba said, "Malik ibn al-Huwayrith used to
show us, at other than the official prayer time, how the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace,prayed. He would stand, doing it absolutely
correctly and then go into <I>ruku'</I>, doing it absolutely correctly. Then
he would raise his head and stand upright for a time." He said, "His prayer
was like that of our shaykh Abu Yazid." When Abu Yazid raised his head from
the second <I>sajda</I>, he would sit back before getting up.
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIV: Saying the <I>takbir</I> while going down into <I>sajda</I></B>
<P>
Nafi' said that Ibn 'Umar used to place his hands on the ground before his
knees.
<P>
770. It is related from Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Harith ibn Hisham
and Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman said that Abu Hurayra used to say the
<I>takbir</I> in every prayer whether obligatory or otherwise, in Ramadan
or other months. He would say the <I>takbir</I> when he stood up and then
again when he went into <I>ruku' </I>and then he would say, "Allah hears
whoever praises Him," following it with, "Our Lord, praise belongs to You,"
before going into <I>sajda</I>. Then he would say, "Allah is greater," when
going down into <I>sajda</I> and would say the <I>takbir</I> again when raising
his head from <I>sajda</I>. He would also say the <I>takbir</I> when he stood
up from sitting after the first two<I> rak'ats</I>. He would do that in
every<I> rak'at </I>until he finished the prayer. Then when he finished he
would say, "By the One in whose hand my self is, of all of you my prayer
most closely resembles that of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace. This was his prayer until he left this world."
<P>
771. They both said that Abu Hurayra said, "When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, raised his head, he would say, 'Allah
hears whoever praises Him. Our Lord, praise belongs to You.' He used to pray
for some men whom he named and would say, 'O Allah, save al-Walid ibn al-Walid,
Salama ibn Hisham, 'Ayyash ibn Rabi'a and all oppressed believers. O Allah,
make the punishment of Mudar severe and make them have years of famine like
in the time of Yusuf.' At that time, the people of the eastern Mudar were
opposing him."
<P>
772. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, fell from (<I>'an</I>) his horse [It
is possible that Sufyan said <I>min</I> rather than<I> 'an</I>.] while riding
and his right side was grazed. We went to visit him and the time for the
prayer arrived. He led us in the prayer sitting down and we stayed sitting
down. [On one occasion Sufyan said, "We prayed sitting down."] When he finished
the prayer, he said, 'The Imam is appointed to be followed. Say the
<I>takbir</I> when he says the <I>takbir</I>. Go into <I>ruku' </I>when he
goes into <I>ruku</I>', and get up when he gets up. When he says, "Allah
hears whoever praises Him," say, "Our Lord, praise belongs to You." Go into
<I>sajda</I> when he goes into <I>sajda</I>.'"
<P>
Sufyan has that from Ma'mar. Ibn Jurayj said that his right leg was grazed.
<P>
<P>
<B>XLV: The excellence of <I>sajda</I></B>
<P>
773. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the people said, "Messenger
of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Rising?" He said, "Do you have
any doubt about seeing the moon on a night when it is full and there are
no clouds obscuring it?" They said, "No, Messenger of Allah." He said, "Do
you have any doubt about seeing the sun when there are no clouds obscuring
it?" They said, "No." He said, "That is how you will see Him. On the Day
of Rising people will be gathered together. Allah will say, 'Whoever used
worship something should follow it.' Some of them will follow the sun, some
will follow the moon and some will follow idols. This community will be left,
together with its hypocrites. Then Allah will come to them and say, "I am
your Lord." They will say, "This where we stay until our Lord comes to us.
When our Lord comes to us, we will recognise him." Then Allah will come to
them again and say, "I am your Lord." They will say, "You are our Lord."
He will summon them and the <I>Sirat</I> will be set up over Jahannam, and
I will be the first of the Messengers to cross it with my community. No one
will speak that day except for the Messengers and their words that day will
be, "O Allah, preserve us ! Preserve us!"
<P>
"'In Jahannam there will be hooks like the thorns of the prickly-plant Have
you seen the thorns of the prickly-plant?' They said, 'Yes.' He said, 'They
are like the thorns of the prickly-plant except that only Allah knows how
huge they are. They will hook onto people according to their actions. Some
of them will be destroyed by their actions and some will be lacerated and
then saved. When Allah wishes to show mercy to those He chooses among the
people of the Fire, He will command the angels to take out all those who
worshipped Allah. They will bring them out, recognising them by the mark
of <I>sajda</I>. Allah has forbidden the Fire to consume the mark of
<I>sajda</I>. Thus they will come out of the Fire. The Fire consumes every
part of the son of Adam except for the mark of <I>sajda</I>. They will emerge
from the Fire burned and blackened and the water of life will be poured over
them and they will grow as the seed on the bank of a stream grows.
<P>
"Then Allah will finish judging between His slaves and only one man will
be left between the Garden and the Fire. He will be the last of the people
of the Fire to enter the Garden. His face will be turned towards the Fire
and he will say, "O Lord! Turn my face away from the Fire! Its wind has poisoned
me and its blaze has burned me." Allah will say, "If that is done for you,
will you not for something else?" He will say, "No, by Your might!" and he
will give Allah whatever pledge and promise he wishes and Allah will turn
his face away from the Fire.
<P>
"'When Allah turns him to face the Garden and he sees its radiance, he will
be silent as long as Allah wills that he be silent. Then he will say, "O
Lord, take me to the door the Garden!" Allah will say, "Did you not give
me pledges and promises that you would not ask for anything other than what
you asked for?" He will say, "O Lord, do not make me the most wretched of
Your creation!" He will say, "If that is granted to you, will you not ask
for something else?" He said, "No, by Your might, I will not ask for anything
except that!" So will give his Lord whatever pledge and promise he wishes.
He will bring him right up to the door of the Garden.
<P>
"'When he reaches its door and sees its flowers and the splendours and pleasures
it contains, he will be silent for as long as Allah wishes him to be silent.
Then he will say, "O Lord, let me enter the Garden!" Allah will say, "Woe
to you, son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Did you not give pledges and
promises that you would not ask for other than what you asked for?" He will
say,"O Lord, do not make me the most wretched of Your creation!" Allah, the
Mighty and Exalted, will laugh at him and then give him permission to enter
the Garden and will say, "Wish" and he will make wishes until, when he stops
wishing, Allah the Mighty and Exalted will say, "Ask for more of such and
such and such and such." His Lord will go on reminding him and when his wishes
are exhausted, Allah the Almighty will say, "You can have that and the same
again." ' "
<P>
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said to Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said that Allah said, 'You can have
that and ten times like it.' " Abu Hurayra said, "I only recall from the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that he said,
'You can have that and the same again.' " Abu Sa'id said, "I heard him say,
'You can have that and ten times like it.' "

the thighs</B>
<P>
774. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Malik ibn Buhayna that when the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed, he would spread his arms

<P>
775. It is related from Abu Wa'il that Hudhayfa saw a man who did not complete
his <I>ruku'</I> and <I>sajda</I>. When he finished his prayer, Hudhayfa
said to him, "You have not prayed." Abu Wa'il said, "I think that he said,
'If you died now, you would die following a <I>sunna</I> other than that
of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"

him and grant him peace, said, "We were commanded to do <I>sajda</I> on seven
bones and not to gather up our clothes or hair."
<P>
778. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib - who was not a liar - said, "We
used to pray behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
When he said, 'Allah hears whoever praises Him,' none of us would bend his
back until the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had placed
his forehead on the ground."
<P>
<P>
<B>L: Doing <I>sajda</I> on the nose</B>
<P>
779. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "I was commanded to do <I>sajda</I> on seven
bones: the forehead (and he pointed to his nose), the two hands, the two
knees and the toes, and not to gather up my clothes or hair."
<P>
<P>
<B>LI: Doing <I>sajda</I> on the nose and in the mud</B>
<P>
780. It is related that Abu Salama said, "I went to Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and
said, 'Could you not come out with us to the palm trees and talk to us.'
He came out." He said, "I said, 'Relate to me what you heard from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about the Night of Power.' He said,
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went into
retreat <I>(i'tikaf</I>) during the first ten nights of Ramadan and we went
into retreat with him. Jibril came to him and said, 'That which you are seeking
is still to come.' Then he went into retreat for the middle ten days and
we went into retreat with him. Jibril came to him and said, 'That which you
are seeking is still to come.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, got up to speak on the morning of the 20th of Ramadan and said,
'Whoever has been doing retreat with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, should continue. I was shown the Night of Power but I have
forgotten it. It is an odd night among the last ten days. I dreamed that
it was as if I was doing <I>sajda</I> in mud and water.' The roof of the
mosque was made of palm branches and we could not see anything in the sky.
Then suddenly a cloud came and it rained on us. The Prophet led us in the
prayer until we could see the traces of mud and water on the forehead and
on the tip of the nose of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, which was the confirmation of his dream."
<P>
<P>
<B>LII: Tying the clothes and wrapping them round. Someone gathering his
garment to him out of the fear that his private parts might become
uncovered</B>
<P>
781. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "People used to pray with the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with their wrappers tied
round their necks because of how small they were. The women were told, 'Do
not raise your heads until the men are sitting up straight.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>LIII: Not gathering up the hair</B>

way as 'Amr ibn Salima, our Shaykh. (Ayyub said, "He used to do something
which I did not see other people doing - he used to sit in the third and
fourth <I>rak'ats</I>.") Malik said, "We came to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and stayed with him. He said, 'If you return to

Qilaba, 'What was his prayer like?' He said, 'The same as the prayer of this
shaykh of ours,' i.e. 'Amr ibn Salima."

two <I>rak'ats</I>, he said the <I>takbir</I>. When he finished the prayer,
'Imran ibn Husayn took hold of my hand and said, 'This man reminded me of
the prayer of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,' or he said,

<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#54">793</A>. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdullah
saw 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar cross his legs in the sitting position of the prayer.
He said, "So I did the same, and I was young at the time." Abdullah ibn 'Umar
forbade me to do it saying, 'The <I>sunna</I> of the prayer is that you keep
your right foot vertical and lay your left foot down.' I said, 'But you were
doing that that.' He said, 'My feet do not support me.'"
<P>
794. It is related from Muhammad ibn 'Amr ibn 'Ata' that he was sitting with
a group of the Companions of the Prophet. "We mentioned the prayer of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Humayd as-Sa'idi
said, 'I remember the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, better than any of you. I saw that when he said the
<I>takbir</I> he lifted his hands level with his shoulders. When he did<I>
ruku'</I>, he placed his hands on his knees and then bent his back straight.
When he raised his head, he stood up straight until each vertebra had returned
to its place. When he went into <I>sajda</I>, he placed his arms so that
they were neither stretched out nor held close. The toes of his feet pointed
towards the <I>qibla</I>. When he sat after the first two <I>rak'ats</I>,
he sat on his left foot and kept his right foot upright. When he sat after
the last <I>rak'at</I>, he extended his left foot across, keeping the other
upright and sat on his buttocks."

go back</B>
<P>
795. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Buhayna who was from Azd Shanu'a and
was the ally of of the Banu 'Abdu Manaf and he was one of the Companions
of the Prophet, that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
led them in <I>Dhuhr</I>. He stood up after the first two <I>rak'ats
</I>without sitting back. The people stood up with him. When the prayer was
ended and the people were waited for the <I>taslim</I>, he said the
<I>takbir</I> while still sitting and then did two <I>sajdas</I> before saying
the <I>salam</I>. Then he said the <I>salam</I>.

behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we said, 'Peace
be upon Jibril and Mika'il. Peace be upon so-and-so and so-and-so.' The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, turned to us and said, 'Allah is
Peace. When you pray, you should say, "Greetings belong to Allah and good
words and prayers. Peace be upon you, O Prophet and the mercy of Allah and
His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the right-acting slaves of Allah."
If you say that, it will cover every right-acting slave of Allah in the heavens
and the earth. "I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that
Muhammad is His slave and Messenger."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXV: Supplication before the <I>salam</I></B>
<P>
798. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, reported that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to make

of the grave and I seek refuge with You from the trial of the False Messiah
(<I>Dajjal</I>) and I seek refuge with you from the trials of life and the
trial of death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from wrong action and debt."
Someone said to him, "How often you seek refuge from debt!" He said, "When
someone is in debt, when he speaks, he lies and when he makes a promise,
he breaks it."

bless him and grant him peace, seek refuge in his prayer from the trial of
the Dajjal."
<P>

and none forgives wrong actions except You, so grant me Your forgiveness
and be merciful to me. You are the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVI: Voluntary supplication after the <I>tashahhud</I> which is not
obligatory</B>
<P>
800. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "When we were doing the prayer with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we used to say, 'Peace
be upon Allah from His slaves. Peace be upon so-and-so and so-and-so.' The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not say, "Peace
be upon Allah." Allah is Peace. Rather say, "Greetings belong to Allah and
good words and prayers. Peace be upon you, O Prophet and the mercy of Allah
and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon all the right-acting slaves
of Allah." If you say that, it will cover every right-acting slave of Allah
in the heavens and the earth. "I testify that there is no god but Allah and
I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger." Then he can choose any
supplication he likes and use it.' "

Allah bless him and grant him peace, said the <I>salam</I>, the women would
get up as soon as he finished saying it and he would stay there a short time
before getting up."
<P>
Ibn Shihab said, "I think - and Allah knows best - that he stayed so that
the women could leave before any of the people who had finished the prayer
caught up with them."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIX: Saying the <I>salam</I> at the same time as the Imam says it</B>

<P>
803. It is related that 'Itban said, "We prayed with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said the <I>salam</I> at the same time
as he said it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXX: Someone not returning the greeting to the Imam and considering the
<I>taslim</I> of the prayer sufficient</B>
<P>
804. It is related from Mahmud ibn ar-Rabi' that he claimed to remember the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and remember
him spitting out a mouthful of water taken from a bucket in their house.
He said, "I heard 'Itban ibn Malik al-Ansari, one of the Banu Salim, say,
"I used to lead my people, the Banu Salim, in the prayer. I went to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "My eyesight is weak and
the flood-water comes between me and the mosque of my people. I would like
you to come and pray somewhere in my house so that I can use it as a mosque."
He said, "I will do that, Allah willing." The next morning the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr came to me
well into the day. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, asked for permission to enter and I gave him permission. He did
not sit down when he entered the house, but said, 'Where in your house would
you like me to pray?' I pointed out to him the place where I wanted him to
pray. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood
and we formed rows behind him and then he said the <I>salam</I> and we said
the <I>salam</I> at the same time as he said it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXI: <I>Dhikr</I> after the prayer</B>
<P>
805. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that in the time of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, voices were raised in <I>dhikr</I> when people
finished the obligatory prayers.
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "When I heard that I knew by it that they had finished."
<P>
806. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I knew that the prayer of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was over from the <I>takbirs</I>."
<P>
807. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The poor people came to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and said, "The rich people have gone
off with the higher degrees and everlasting bliss. They pray as we pray and
fast as we fast but they have more wealth than us which they use to go on
<I>hajj</I> and <I>'umra</I>, to do <I>jihad</I> and to give <I>sadaqa</I>.
He said, 'Shall I tell you something which will enable you, if you take it
on, to catch up with those who have gone ahead of you. No one coming after
you will be able to catch up with you and you will be the best of those you
live among, except someone who does the same thing? Say, "Glory be to Allah,"
"Praise belongs to Allah" and "Allah is greater" after every prayer thirty-three
times each.' There was a disagreement between us and some of us said "Glory
be to Allah," thirty-three times, "Praise belongs to Allah," thirty-three
times and "Allah is greater," thirty-four times. I went back to him and he
said, 'You should say, "Glory be to Allah," "Praise belongs to Allah," and
"Allah is greater," saying each thirty-three times.' "
<P>
808. It is related that Warrad, the scribe of al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, said,
"Al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba dictated to me in a letter to Mu'awiya that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say after every obligatory
prayer, 'There is no god but Allah alone with no partner. The kingdom and
praise belong to Him and He has power over everything. O Allah, none can
withhold what You give nor give what You withhold and the jadd of someone
who has it is of no avail against You.' "
<P>
Al-Qasim ibn Mukhaymira has this from Warrad. Al-Hasan said, "<I>Jadd</I>
means wealth."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXII: The Imam facing the people when he says the <I>salam</I></B>
<P>
809. It is related that Samura ibn Jundub said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, turned his face towards us when he had finished
a prayer."
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#r4">810</A>. It is related that Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani
said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led us in the
<I>Subh</I> prayer at Hudaybiyya after a rainy night. When he finished, he
faced the people and said, 'Do you know what your Lord has said?' They said,
'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'This morning My slaves have
become divided up into believers and unbelievers. Those who said, "We had
rain by the favour and mercy of Allah," believe in Me and reject the stars.
Those who said that it was because of a certain star, disbelieve in Me and
believe in the star."
<P>
811. It is related that Anas said, "One night the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, delayed the prayer until half the night
had passed and then came out to us. When he had prayed he turned his face
to us. He said, 'The people have prayed and gone to sleep and you are still
in the prayer as long as you are waiting for the prayer.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIII: The Imam staying in the place of prayer after the
<I>salam</I></B>
<P>
It is related that Nafi' said, "Ibn 'Umar used to pray in the same place
in which he had prayed the obligatory prayer." Al-Qasim also did that. What
is mentioned from Abu Hurayra (<I>marfu'</I>) about the Imam not doing the
voluntary prayer in his place is not sound.
<P>
812. It is related from Umm Salama that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, would stay in his place for a short time.
<P>
Ibn Shihab said, "We think - and Allah knows best - that it was so that the
women who had finished could leave."
<P>
Ibn Shihab wrote that Hind bint al-Harith al-Firasiyya, one of the companions
of Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet, said that Umm Salama said, "He would
say the <I>salam</I> and the women would leave and enter their houses before
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left."
<P>
(Variations in the <I>isnad</I>.)
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIV: Someone leading the people in the prayer and then, remembering
something he has to do, has to step over the people</B>
<P>
813. It is related that 'Uqba said, "I prayed <I>'Asr</I> behind the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in Madina. He said the <I>salam</I>
and then got up hurriedly and stepped over people's shoulders making for
the room of one of his wives. The people were alarmed at his speed. He came
out to them and saw that they were surprised at his speed and said, 'I remembered
a piece of gold that we had and I did not want it to distract me so I ordered
that it be distributed.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXV: Facing and turning to the right and left</B>
<P>
Anas used to face right and left and criticised those who purposed to turn
to the right alone
<P>
814. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "None of you should give Shaytan
any of his prayer by thinking that he has only to turn to the right. I often
saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, turning to the
left."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVI: What has come about raw garlic, onions and leeks</B>
<P>
The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Anyone
who has eaten garlic or onions out of hunger or for any other reason should
not come near our mosque."
<P>
815. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said during the expedition to Khaybar, "Anyone who eats
any of this plant, i.e. garlic, should not come near our mosque."
<P>
816. It is related that 'Ata' heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who eats any of this
plant, i.e. garlic, should not come to our mosques." 'Ata' said, "What does
he mean by this?" He said, "I think he only means raw garlic."
<P>
Ibn Jurayh said, "Only its smell."
<P>
It is related from Ibn Wahb that he was brought a pot containing vegetables.
Yunus did not mention the story of the plate.
<P>
I do not know whether it is from the words of az-Zuhri or in the actual
<I>hadith</I>.
<P>
817. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah stated that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who eats garlic and onions
should keep away from us (or he said, "should keep away from our mosque")
and he should stay in his house." He said, "The Prophet was brought a pot
of cooked vegetables and found that it had a smell. He asked about it and
was told what vegetables it contained. He told them to take it to some of
his Companions who were with him. When he saw it, he did not like to eat
it but said, 'Eat, for I have to converse privately with people with whom
you do not have to converse.'
<P>
Ibn Shihab supports the statement of Yunus.
<P>
818. It is related that 'Abdu'l-'Aziz said, "A man asked Anas, 'What did
you hear from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about
garlic?' He said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Anyone who eats some of this plant should not come near us or pray
with us.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVII: The <I>wudu' </I>of children and when they must do <I>ghusl</I>
and purify themselves. Their attending the group prayer, the two <I>'ids</I>,
funeral prayers and their prayer lines</B>
<P>
819. It is related that Sulayman ash-Shaybani said, "I heard ash-Sha'bi say,
'Someone who passed with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
by a grave which was set apart informed me that he had led them in the prayer
and they had lined up behind him.' I said, 'Abu 'Amr, who related this to
you?' He said, 'Ibn 'Abbas.' "
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#j4">820</A>. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "<I>Ghusl</I>
is obligatory for every man who has reached puberty on the day of
<I>Jumu'a</I>."
<P>
821. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, See 117 from "Once I spent the in
the house of my aunt, Maymuna, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, slept. After some of the night had passed, the Prophet got up
and did <I>wudu' </I>lightly from a hanging waterskin - 'Amr (one of the
narrators) described it as being light and used little water - and stood
up to pray. I got up and did <I>wudu' </I>as he had done and then went and
stood on his left. He moved me to his right and then prayed as much as Allah
willed and then lay down and went to sleep to the extent that he snored.
Then the caller came and announced the prayer, then the Prophet went with
him for the prayer and he prayed without doing <I>wudu'</I>." We said to
'Amr, "Some people say, "The eyes of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, sleep but his heart does not sleep." 'Amr said that
he heard 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr say, "The dreams of the Prophets are revelation."
Then he recited [the conversation of Ibrahim to Isma'il], <I>"I saw in a
dream that I was sacrificing you." </I>(37:102)
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t34">822</A>. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that his
grandmother, Mulayka, invited the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, for some food which she had prepared for him. He ate
some of it and then said, "Get up. I will lead you in prayer." Anas said,
"I went to fetch our mat which had become black from long use and I sprinkled
it with water. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, stood on it and the orphan and I lined up behind him and the old woman
stood behind us. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, prayed two <I>rak'ats </I>with us.
<P>
823. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Once, when I was just past puberty,
I came up riding a she-ass as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was leading the people in prayer at Mina without any
wall in front of them. I passed in front of one of the rows, dismounted,
left my she-ass to graze, and joined the row. No one objected to me doing
that.
<P>
824. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, delayed the prayer."
<P>
It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, delayed <I>'Isha'</I>. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, did not come out until 'Umar said, 'The women and
children have gone to sleep.' Then he came out and said to the people in
the mosque, 'No people on earth have prayed this prayer except you.' No one
except the people of Madina prayed at that time."
<P>
825. It is related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Abis, "I heard a man ask Ibn
'Abbas, 'Were you present when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went out (to the <I>'Id </I>prayer)?' He said, 'Yes
and if it had been for my place with him, I would not have attended it, i.e.
because of his youth. He went to the waymark by the house of Kathir ibn as-Salt
and gave an address. Then he went to the women and admonished them, reminding
them and commanding them to give <I>sadaqa</I> (charity). A woman would put
her hand up to her necklace and throw it into Bilal's garment. Then he and
Bilal came to the house.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVIII: The women going out to the mosques at night in the darkness</B>
<P>
826. It is related that 'A'isha said, "One night the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, delayed <I>'Isha' </I>until 'Umar
called out, 'The women and children have gone to sleep.' The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out and said, 'No people on the
earth would have waited for it except you.' In those days, the prayer was
done only in Madina. They used to pray<I> 'Isha' </I>between the disappearance
of the redness of sunset up until the end of the first third of the night."
<P>
827. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "When your women ask for your permission to go to
mosque at night, give them permission."
<P>

prayer)</B>
<P>
828. It is related from Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet, that in the
time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, the women used
to get up as soon as they said the <I>salam</I> for the obligatory prayer.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and those
of the men who prayed would remain there as long as Allah willed. When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up, the
men got up.

829. It is related that 'A'isha reported, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to pray <I>Subh</I> and the women would
leave wrapped up in their garments and no one could recognise them because
of how dark it was."

830. It is related that Abu Qatada al-Ansari's father said that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I stand in prayer
wanting to make it long but I hear the crying of a child and shorten my prayer
disliking to make it difficult for its mother."
<P>
831. It is related that 'A'isha said, "If the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had known what the women were going to do,
he would have forbidden them as the women of the Children of Isra'il were
forbidden." Yahya ibn Sa'id said to 'Amra, "Were they forbidden?" She said,
"Yes."

Allah bless him and grant him peace, the <I>salam</I>, the women would get
up as soon as he finished saying it and he would stay there a short time
before getting up." He said, "I think - and Allah knows best - that he stayed
so that the women could leave before any of the people who had finished the
prayer caught up with them."
<P>
833. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, prayed in the house of Umm Sulaym and the orphan and I stood
behind him and Umm Sulaym stood behind us."

bless him and grant him peace, used to pray <I>Subh</I> when it was dark
and the believing women would leave and could not be recognised due to the
darkness nor could they recognise one another."
<P>
<B>LXXXII: A woman asking her husband's permission to go out to the mosque</B>

mosque at night, give them permission."
