Saying the Name of Allah while Hunting</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Forbidden for you are carrion </I>... to... &nbsp;<I>So do not be afraid of them but be afraid of Me." </I>(5:1-3)<P>His words, <I>"O you who believe, Allah will test you with game animals whichcome within the reach of your hands and spears."</I> (5:94)<P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"All livestock animals are lawful for you,except those that are recited to you now..." </I>(5:1)<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "<I>'uqud"</I> (5:1) are contracts, both lawful andunlawful.<I> "Except those that are recited to you now" </I>(5:2) are pigs."<I>yajrimannakum</I>" (5:2) means "incite you". "<I>Shanan</I>" (5:2) meanshatred. <I>"Al-munkhaniqa"</I> (5:3) means that which has been choked todeath. "<I>Al-Manqudha"</I> (5:3) means struck by wood with a fatal blow.<I>"Al-mataraddiya" </I>(5:3) means having fallen from a mountain.<I>"An-Natiha"</I> is a gored sheep. If one reaches it while its tail oreyes are &nbsp;still moving, then you can slaughter and eat it.<P>5158. It is related from 'Amir that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about featherless arrows.He said, 'Eat what it hits with its sharp end. What has been hit side onhas been beaten to death.' I asked him about hunting dogs and he said, "Eatwhat they catch for you. The act of the dog seizing the game is slaughter.If you find another dog with your dog or dogs, and you fear that it tookthe game with your dog and killed it, then do not eat it. You said the Nameof Allah over your dog, but did not do so over the other dog.'"<P><P><B>II. Game killed by a featherless arrow</B><P>Ibn 'Umar said about an animal killed with a hazelnut, "That is like theanimal beaten to death."<P>Salim, al-Qasim, Mujahid, Ibrahim, 'Ata' and al-Hasan disliked it.<P>Al-Hasan disliked using hazelnuts* in towns and villages, but saw no harmin using them elsewhere.<P>[<A NAME="bunduqa">This</A> can also refer to clay pellets.]<P>5159. Ash-Sha'bi reported that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about featherless arrows.He said, 'Eat what it hits with its sharp end. What has been hit side onand killed has been beaten to death, so do not eat it.' I asked, 'What ifI set loose my dog?' He replied, 'When you let your dog loose and say the<I>basmala</I>, then you can eat.' I asked, 'If it eats some of it?' He answered,'Then do not eat it. It did not catch it for you. It caught it for itself.'I said, 'And if I set loose my dog and find another dog with it?' He replied,''Do not eat it for you have said the <I>basmala</I> over your dog but notover the other one.'"<P><P><B>III. Game hit by the flat side of the featherless arrow</B><P>5160. It is related by Hammam ibn al-Harith that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "Isaid, 'Messenger of Allah, we set loose trained dogs.' He said, 'Eat whatthey catch for you.' I asked, 'Even if they kill it?' 'Even if they killit,' he answered. I said, 'We also shoot it with featherless arrows.' Hesaid, 'Eat what is pierced by the arrow, but do not eat what it hit by itsside.'"<P><P><B>IV. Hunting with a bow</B><P>Al-Hasan and Ibrahim said, "If someone hits game and severs one of its armsor legs, do not eat that which was severed, but eat the rest."<P>Ibrahim said, "When you hit it in the neck or the middle, then eat it."<P>Al-A'mash reported from Zayd, "A wild ass eluded a man from 'Abdullah's family,so he ['Abdullah ibn Mas'ud] told them to hit however they could and leavewhat was cut from it and eat the rest."<P>5161. It is related that Abu Tha'laba al-Khushani said, "I said, 'Prophetof Allah, we are in the land of the People of the Book. Can we eat from theirvessels? It is a land with game and I hunt with a bow and with my dog whichis not rained and with my trained dog. What am I permitted to eat?' He answered,'As for what you mentioned about the People of the Book, if you can findother vessels, then do not eat from them. If you do not find other vessels,then wash them and eat from them. Eat what you hunt with your bow when youmentioned the Name of Allah. Eat what you hunt with your trained dog whenyou mentioned the Name of Allah. Eat what you hunt with your untrained dogwhen you are able to slaughter it.'"<P><P><B>V. <I>Khadhf</I> (flicking small stones) and<I><A HREF="bukhari38.html#bunduqa">bunduqa</A></I> (hazelnuts)</B><P>5162. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal saw a man flicking smallstones and told him, "Do not flick small stones. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade flicking small stones, orhe used to dislike doing it." 'Abdullah said, "one does not hunt game bythat nor hurt an enemy by it, but it may break a tooth or cause loss of aneye." Then he saw the man flicking stones after that and said to him, "Itell you that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,forbade or disliked flicking small stones and you are still flicking them!I will not speak to you for such-and-such a time."<P><P><B>VI. The one who keeps a dog which is neither for hunting or for herding</B><P>5163. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar reported that he heard Ibn 'Umar relate that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who acquiresa dog - except one for herding or trained for hunting - loses two qiratsof his actions every day.'"<P>5164. It is related that Salim heard 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar say, "I heard theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Anyone who acquiresa dog - except one trained for hunting game or herding, has his reward decreasedby two qirats every day.'"<P>5165. It is related from Nafi' that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who acquiresa dog - except one for herding or trained for hunting, loses two qirats ofhis actions every day.'"<P><P><B>VII. When the dog eats [of the game]</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"They will ask you what is lawful for them.Say: 'All good things are lawful for you, and also what is caught for youby hunting animals ..."</I> (5:4)<P>"Trained dog are called <I>sawa'id</I> and <I>kawasib</I>. "<I>Ijtaru</I>"(45:21) is to earn.<P>"<I>which you have trained as Allah has taught you</I>.<I> Eat what theycatch for you, mentioning Allah's name over it. And show fear of Allah. Allahis Swift at Reckoning." </I>(5:4)<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "If the dog eats the game, it spoils it. It has caught itfor itself. Allah says, <I>'which you have trained as Allah has taughtyou</I>.' So they are beaten and taught to leave the game."<P>Ibn 'Umar disliked &nbsp;eating it.<P>'Ata' said, "If the dog drinks the blood but does not eat it, then you caneat it."<P>5166. It is related from ash-Sha'bi that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I asked aquestion of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,saying, 'We are a people who hunt with these dogs.' He said, 'When you letloose your trained dogs having mentioned the Name of Allah, then eat fromwhat they catch for you, even if they kill it, but the dogs eats some ofit. I would then fear that it has caught it for itself. If other dogs joinyour dog, then do not eat it."<P><P><B>VIII. If one fails to find the game (he has shot) for two or three days</B><P>5167. It is related from ash-Sha'bi from 'Adi ibn Hatim that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When you let your dog looseand say the <I>basmala</I>, then you can eat. If it eats some of it, youshould not eat for it has caught it for itself. If it joins other dogs overwhom the Name of Allah has not mentioned who then catch an animal and killit, do not eat. You do not know which of them has killed it. If you shootgame and find it two or three days later with no mark other than that ofyour arrow, then eat it. If it has fallen into water. then do not eat it."<P>'Amir related from 'Adi that he said to the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, "What is someone shoots game and loses its track fortwo or three days and then finds it dead with his arrow in it?" He answered,"He can eat it if he wishes."<P><P><B>IX. If someone finds another dog with the game</B><P>5168. It is related from ash-Sha'bi that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I said, 'Messengerof Allah, I let loose my dog and say the <I>basmala</I>.' He said, 'Whenyou let loose your dog and say the <I>basmala</I>, and it catches and killsit and then eats of it, do not eat it. It has caught it for itself.' I asked,'If I let loose my dog and find another dog with it and do not know whichof them has caught it?' He answered, 'Do not eat it. You said the<I>basmala</I> over your dog, but not over the other dog.' I asked him aboutgame shot with a featherless arrow. He said, 'Eat what it hits with its sharpend. What has been hit side on and killed has been beaten to death, so donot eat it.'"<P><P><B>X. What has been said about hunting</B><P>5169. It is related from 'Amir that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'We are a people who huntwith these dogs.' He said, 'When you let loose your trained dog and mentionthe Name of Allah, eat what it catches for you. If it eats from it, do noteat. I fear that it has caught it for itself. If another dog from elsewherejoins it, then do not eat it."<P>5170. It is related that Abu Idris 'A'idhullah heard Abu Tha'laba al-Khushanisay, "I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, we are in the land of the People ofthe Book, and we eat from their vessels. It is a land with game and I huntwith a bow and with my dog which is not trained and with my trained dog.Tell me what is lawful for us of that.' He answered, 'As for what you mentionedabout being in the land of the People of the Book and eating from their vessels,if you find other vessels than their vessels, then do not eat from them.If you do not find them, then wash them and eat from them. As for what youmentioned of being in a land with game, eat what you hunt with your bow whenyou mentioned the Name of Allah. Eat what you hunt with your trained dogwhen you mentioned the Name of Allah. Eat what you hunt with your untraineddog when you are able to slaughter it.'"<P>5171. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We made a rabbit bolt fromits hole at Marr az-Zahran and the people ran after it but got tired. I gotto it, caught it and brought it to Abu Talha. He sent its haunch and thighsto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he acceptedthat."<P>5172. It is related from Abu Qatada that he was with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When he had gone part of the wayto Makka, he and some of his companions who were in <I>ihram</I> fell back.He was not in <I>ihram</I>. He say a wild ass, mounted his horse and thenasked his companions to hand him a whip and they refused. He asked them forhis spear and they refused. He took it and attacked the ass and killed it.Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, ate it and others refused. When they caught up to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they asked him about thatand he said, "It is food with which Allah has fed you."<P>The like of it related from Abu Qatada but the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Do you have any of its meat still with you?"<P><P><B>XI. Hunting on mountains</B><P>5173. It is related from Nafi', the client of Abu Qatada, and Abu Salih,the client of at-Taw'ama, that Abu Qatada said, "I was with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, between Makka and Madina and theywere in ihram. I was a man not in ihram on the horse and I used to be goodat going up mountains. While I was like that, I saw the people looking atsomething and I looked and there was a wild ass. I said to them, 'What isthis?' "We do not know,' they answered. I said, 'It is a wild ass.' Theysaid, 'It is as you have seen.' I had forgotten my whip and said to them,'Hand me my whip,' They replied, 'I will not help you. I dismounted and tookit. Then I chased after it and kept on until I had killed it. I came to themand said, 'Get up and carry it.' They said, 'We will not touch it.' I carriedit and brought it to them. Some of them refused and some of them ate it.I said, 'I will ask the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,to stop for you. I caught up to him and told him the story. He asked me,'Do you have any of it still with you?' 'Yes,' I replied. He said, 'Eat.It is food with which Allah has fed you."<P><P><B>XII. The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "What you catch in the sea is lawfulfor you and all food from it." </I>(5:96)</B><P>'Umar said that its game is what is caught and its "food" is what it castsup.<P>Abu Bakr said, "Floating fish are lawful."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "Its 'food' is its dead fish except for what you deem unclean.Jews do not eat eels, but we eat them."<P>Shurayh, a Companion of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Everything in the sea is considered to be slaughtered."<P>'Ata' said, "I think that seabirds must be slaughtered."<P>Ibn Jurayj said, "I asked 'Ata', 'What about the catch of rivers and smallbodies of water. Is that water game?' 'Yes,' he answered. Then he recited,<I>'This one, sweet, refreshing, delicious to drink that one salty, bitter tothe taste. Yet from both of them you eat fresh flesh.' </I>(35:12)<P>Al-Hasan [ibn 'Ali], peace be upon him, rode a saddle made of sharkskin.[Note: in Arabic a shark is<I> kalb al-bahr</I>, sea dog.]<P>Ash-Sha'bi said, "If my family would eat frogs, I would feed them to them."<P>Al-Hasan did not see anything wrong with turtles/tortoises.<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "Eat of the catch of the sea, even if it is caught by aChristian, Jew or Magian."<P>Abu'd-Darda' said about the <I>muri</I>*, "The fish and the sun are theslaughtering of the wine."<P>[*Wine in which fish and salt are put and then it is placed in the sun andchanges. It makes it into vinegar.]<P>5174. It is related that 'Amr heard Jabir say, "We went out on an expeditionas the Army of al-Khabt under the command of Abu 'Ubayda. We were afflictedby terrible hunger, and the sea cast up a dead fish whose like we had neverseem. It is called a sperm whale. We ate from it for half a month. Abu 'Ubaydatook one of its bones and a rider rode under it."<P>5175. 'Amr related that he heard Jabir say, "The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, sent us, three hundred riders, whosecommander was Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, to ambush the caravan of Quraysh.We were afflicted by terrible hunger so that we ate the leaves of the khabttree and so that army was called the Army of al-Khabat. and we ate from itfor half a month and we oiled ourselves with its fat until our bodies returnedto their former strength. Abu 'Ubayda took one of its ribs and set it uprightand a rider passed under it. When the hunger was severe, one man among usslaughtered three camels, and then slaughtered another three camels and thenAbu 'Ubayda forbade him."<P><P><B>XIII. Eating locusts</B><P>5176. Abu Ya'fur reported that he heard Ibn Abi Awfa say, "We went on sevenor six expeditions with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and we used to eat locusts with him.<P>It is related from Abu Ya'fur from Ibn Abi Awfa, "seven expeditions."<P><P><B>XIV. The vessels of Magians and eating carrion</B><P>5177. It is related that Abu Tha'laba al-Khushani said, "I went to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, weare in the land of the people of the Book and we eat from their vessels.It is a land with game and I hunt with a bow and with my dog which is notrained and with my trained dog' He answered, 'As for what you mentioned aboutthe People of the Book, do not eat from their vessels unless you cannot findany alternative. If you do not find an alternative, then wash them and eatfrom them. As for what you mentioned about being in a land with game, whenyou hunt with your bow, mention the Name of Allah and eat. When you huntwith your trained dog, mention the Name of Allah and eat. When you hunt withyour untrained dog and are able to slaughter it, then eat it.'"<P>5178. It is related from Yazid ibn Abi 'Ubayd that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said,"In the evening of the day when we conquered Khaybar, they lit fires. TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'For what are thesefires being kindled?' They answered, 'For the meat of domestic donkeys.'He said,' Pour out what is in them and break the pots.' A man of the peopleasked, 'Shall we pour out what is in them and wash them.' The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Or do that.'"<P><P><B>XV. Mention the <I>basmala</I> when slaughtering, and those who deliberatelyomit it</B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "There is no harm if someone forgets it."<P>Allah Almighty says<I>, "Do not eat anything over which the name of Allahhas not been mentioned. To do so is sheer degeneracy (fisq)." </I>(6:121)Ibn 'Abbas said that the one who forgets&nbsp;to do that is not called<I>fasiq</I>.<P>He says, <I>"The shaytans inspire their friends to dispute with you. If youobeyed them you would be idolaters."</I> (5:121)<P><P>5179. It is related that the grandfather of 'Abaya ibn Rifa' ibn Rafi' ibnKhadij said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, at Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The people were afflicted by hunger and we had seizedsome camels and sheep as booty. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was somewhat behind the people and they hurried and slaughteredand set up the pots. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,reached them and ordered the pots to be emptied. Then he carried out thedivision. He made ten sheep equal to a camel. One of the camels fled. Therewere few horses among the people. The people went after it until they becameexhausted. One of the men aimed an arrow at it and Allah stopped the camel.Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Some ofthese animals are wild like wild animals. If you loose control over them,then do as this man did.'" My grandfather said, "We expect - or fear - thatwe may meet the enemy tomorrow and not have any knives. Can we slaughterwith reeds?" He said, "Use whatever makes the blood flow and eat it whenthe Name of Allah has been mentioned over it. Do not [slaughter] with a toothor nail, and I will tell you about that. The tooth is a bone and the nailis the knife of the Abyssinians.'"<P><P><B>XVI. That which has been slaughtered on altars and to idols</B><P>5180. Salim related that he heard 'Abdullah report that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, met Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn Nufaylat the bottom of Baldah before any revelation had come down on the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, offered him a dish with some meatin it, but he refused to eat of it. [This is also read, "The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was offered...] Then he said,'I do not eat from what you slaughter to your idols. I only eat from thatover which the name of Allah has been mentioned.'"<P><P><B>XVII. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"Slaughter in the Name of Allah."</B><P>5182. It is related that Jundub ibn Sufyan al-Bajali said, "One day we sacrificedsome animals with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace. Some people had sacrificed their animals before the prayer. When hefinished [the prayer], the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,saw that they had slaughtered before the prayer. He said, 'Anyone who hasslaughtered before the prayer should slaughter another in its place. Anyonewho has not yet slaughtered should do so in the Name of Allah.'"<P><P><B>XVIII. That which causes the blood to flow, be it cane, stone or iron</B><P>5182. Nafi' reported that the son of Ka'b ibn Malik told Ibn 'Umar that hisfather (Ka'b) told him that they had a slavegirl who used to herd some sheepof theirs at Sal'. She saw that one of her sheep which was dying and brokea stone and slaughtered it. He told his family, "Do not eat it until I goto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and ask him," or"Send someone to him to ask him." He went to the Prophet* or sent to him,and the Prophet commanded them to eat it."<P>5183. A man of the Banu Salama reported that 'Abdullah told him that a slavegirlbelonging to Ka'b ibn Malik used to herd some sheep of his at a small mountainsat the market which is at Sal'. A sheep was fatally injured and she brokea stone and slaughtered it. They mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and he commanded them to eat it.<P>5184. It is related that Rafi' [ibn Khadij] said, "Messenger of Allah, wehave no knives?" He said, "If it makes the blood flow and the Name of Allahhas been mentioned, then eat. Do not [slaughter] with a tooth or nail. Thenail is the knife of the Abyssinians and a tooth is a bone." A camel ranaway and was stopped. He said, "Some of these animals are wild like wildanimals. If you lose control over them, then do as this man did."<P><P><B>XIX. Slaughtering done by a woman or slavegirl</B><P>5185. Nafi' reported that the son of Ka'b ibn Malik reported from his fatherthat a woman slaughtered a sheep with a stone and the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was asked about that and commanded that itbe eaten.<P>It is related from Nafi' that he heard a man of the Ansar report to 'Abdullahfrom the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that a slavegirlbelonging to Ka'b...<P>5186. It is related from Nafi' from a man of the Ansar from Mu'adh ibn Sa'dor Sa'd ibn Mu'adh that a slavegirl belonging to Ka'b ibn Malik used to herdsome sheep at Sal'. One of the sheep was fatally injured and she caught itand slaughtered it with a stone. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was asked about that and said, "Eat it."<P><P><B>XX. Do not slaughter with a tooth, bone or nail</B><P>5187. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij said that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Eat what has been slaughtered by whatmakes the blood flow except for a tooth or a nail."<P><P><B>XXI. Animals slaughtered by desert Arabs and the like</B><P>5188. It is related from 'A'isha that some people said to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, "Some people bring us meat and we donot know whether or not the Name of Allah has been mentioned over it." Hesaid, "Mention the Name of Allah over it and eat." She said, "Those peoplehad been unbelievers shortly before."<P>'Ali corroborated it from ad-Darawardi, and Abu Khalid and at-Tufawi corroboratedit.<P><P><B>XXII. Animals slaughtered by the People of the Book and their fat, nomatter whether they are the people of war or not</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Today all good things have been made lawfulfor you. And the food of those given the Book is also lawful for you andyour food is lawful for them." </I>(5:5)<P>Az-Zuhri said, "There is nothing wrong in eating the animals slaughteredby the Christian Arabs. If you hear someone mention other than Allah, thendo not eat it. If you do not hear that, then Allah has allowed you that andHe knows their disbelief." The like of this is also mentioned from 'Ali.<P>Al-Hasan and Ibrahim said that there is nothing wrong in eating animalsslaughtered by an uncircumcised person.<P>Ibn 'Abbas said that "their food" means their slaughtered animals.<P>5189. It related that 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal said, "While we were layingsiege to the fortress of Khaybar, someone threw a skin full of fat and Ileapt to take it. I turned and there was the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and I was too embarrassed to do it."<P><P><B>XXIII. Animals which run away are like wild animals</B><P>Ibn Mas'ud permitted that.<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "If you cannot catch domestic animals you own, then theyare like game. If a camel falls into a well, slaughter it by whatever partof it you can reach.*<P>[*Note. That is the view of three imams: Abu Hanifa, ash-Shafi'i and Ahmadibn Hanbal. Malik said that it is only permitted to slaughter it in the neck.]<P>'Ali, Ibn 'Umar and 'A'isha held that view.<P>5190. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah,we will meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives.' He said, 'Hurry (orBe quick). If it makes the blood flow and the Name of Allah has been mentioned,then eat. Do not [slaughter] with a tooth or nail. I will tell you aboutthat. A tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of the Abyssinians.' Wegot some camels and sheep and one of the camels fled. There were few horsesamong the people. They went after it until they became exhausted. One ofthe men shot an arrow at it and stopped it. Then the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Some of these camels arewild like wild animals. If you lose control over any of them, then do asthis man did.'"<P><P><B>XXIV. Slaughter performed by <I>nahr</I> and normal slaughtering(<I>dhabh</I>)</B><P>Ibn Jurayj said, "'Ata' said, 'There is no <I>dhabh</I> or <I>nahr</I> exceptin the place where <I>dhabh</I> or <I>nahr</I> is performed.' I asked, 'Isit permitted to use <I>dhabh</I> on that which is normally slaughtered bymeans of <I>nahr</I>.' 'Yes,' he replied, 'Allah mentions the dhabh of cattle.If you use <I>dhabh</I> on something which is normally slaughtered by<I>nahr</I>, that is allowed. I prefer <I>nahr</I>. <I>Dhabh</I> is cuttingthe jugular veins.' I asked, 'Should he go beyond the veins and cut the spinalcord?' He said, 'I do not think so.'"<P>Nafi' reported that Ibn 'Umar forbade cutting into the spinal cord. He said,"That is cutting less than the bone and then leaving the animal to die."<P>[Nahr is cutting the veins which are cut in dhabh, but below the neck bystabbing with a spear. Camels are slaughtered in this manner. Dhabh is cuttingthe veins at the top (in the neck) and is used for other animals.]<P><B>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"And when Musa said to his people, 'Allahcommands you to sacrifice a cow (by dhabh).'" </I>(2:67)</B><P>And His words<I>, "So they sacrificed her [by dhabh] &#150; but they almostdid not do it."</I> (2:71)<P>Sa'id said that Ibn 'Abbas said, "<I>Dhabh</I> is done by cutting the gulletand the throat."<P>Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas and Anas said, "If one cuts off the head, there isno harm."<P>5191. It is related from Fatima bint al-Mundhir, the wife of 'Urwa, thatAsma' bint Abi Bakr said, "We slaughtered a horse by <I>nahr</I> in the timeof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and ate it."<P>5192. It is related that Asma' said, "In the time of the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we slaughtered a horse (by<I>dhabh</I>) in Madina and ate it."<P>5193. It is related that Asma' ibn Abi Bakr said, "In the time of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we slaughtered a horse(by <I>dhabh</I>) and ate it."<P>Waki' and Ibn 'Uyayna corroborated <I>nahr</I> from Hisham.<P><P><B>XXV. What is disliked of mutilation of live animals, setting up animalsin a cage as a target and tying up live animals as targets</B><P>5194. It is related that Hisham ibn Zayd said, "I went with Anas to al-Hakamibn Ayyub. He saw some boys or lads who had set up a chicken and were shootingat it. Anas said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,forbade tying up animals so that they could be shot at [and killed]."<P>5195. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that he visited Yahya ibn Sa'id and oneof Yahya's sons had tied up a chicken and was shooting at it. Ibn 'Umar wentand untied it. Then he brought it and the boy and said, "Prevent your boyfrom tying up these birds to kill them. I heard the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, forbade tying up animals so that they could be shotat and killed."<P>5196. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "While I was with Ibn 'Umar,we passed by some young men or a group who had set up a chicken at whichthey were shooting. When they saw Ibn 'Umar, they ran off. Ibn 'Umar said,'Who did this? The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, cursed those who did this.'"<P>It is corroborated from al-Minhal from Sa'id that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cursed the one who mutilated a liveanimal [by cutting off part of it while it was still alive]."<P>'Adi reported it from Sa'id from Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace.<P>5197. It is related that 'Adi ibn Thabit said, "I heard 'Abdullah ibn Yazidreport that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbaderobbery and mutilation of live animals."<P><P><B>XXVI. The meat of chickens</B><P>5198. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "I saw the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, eating chicken."<P>5199. It is related that Zahdam said, "We were with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari,and there was friendship between us and this tribe of Jarm. He was broughtsome food which contains chicken meat. There was a man with a red complexionsitting there who did not go near the food. Abu Musa said, 'Come near! Isaw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, eat it.' He replied,'I saw it eat something filthy and I have taken an oath not to eat it.' Hesaid, 'Come and I will inform &#150; or tell &#150; you about that. I cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, among the groupof the Ash'arites, which happened to be at a time when he was angry. He wasdividing up some of the zakat camels. We asked him to give us mounts andhe swore that he would not give us mounts. He said, 'I have nothing to letyou ride.' Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wasbrought some camels as booty and asked, 'Where are the Ash'arites? Whereare the Ash'arites?' He gave us five camels with white humps. We went a shortdistance and I said to my companions, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, forgot his oath. By Allah, if we take advantageof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forgetting his oath,we will never be successful!' So we went back to the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, you gave us mountswhen you swore that you would not give us mounts. We think that you haveforgotten your oath.' He answered, 'It is Allah who has given you mounts.By Allah, if Allah wills, I will never make an oath and then see somethingbetter than it without doing the thing that is better and then doing expiationfor it.'"<P><P><B>XXVII. Horse-meat</B><P>5200. It is related that Asma' said, "We slaughtered a horse by <I>nahr</I>in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andate it."<P>5201. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "On the Day of the conquestof Khaybar, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadethe meat of donkeys, but made an allowance for horse-meat."<P><P><B>XXVIII. The meat of domestic donkeys</B><P>It is related from Salama from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>5202. It is related from Salim and Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the flesh of domestic donkeyson the Day of Khaybar.<P>It is related &nbsp;from Nafi' that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, forbade the flesh of domestic donkeys."<P>Ibn al-Mubarak corroborated it from 'Ubaydullah from Nafi'. Abu Usama mentionedit from 'Ubaydullah from Salim.<P>5203. It is related that 'Ali said, "In the year of Khaybar, the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the<I> mu'ta</I>marriage and the flesh of domestic donkeys."<P>5204. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "On the Day of the conquestof Khaybar, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadethe meat of donkeys, but made an allowance for horse-meat."<P>5205. It is related that al-Bara' and Ibn Abi Awfa said, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the flesh of donkeys."<P>5206. It is related from Abu Idris that Abu Tha'laba said, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made the meat of domesticdonkeys <I>haram</I>."<P>Az-Zubaydi and 'Uqayl corroborated it from Ibn Shihab.<P>5207. It is related from az-Zuhri that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, forbade every beast of prey with fangs.<P>5208. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that someone came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "The donkeyshave been eaten." Then someone else came to him and said, "The donkeys havebeen eaten." Then someone else came to him and said, "The donkeys have beendestroyed." Then he commanded a caller to call out among the people, "Allahand His Messenger have forbidden you the meat of domestic donkeys. It isimpure." So the pots were tipped out while the meat were boiling in them.<P>5209. It is related that 'Amr said, "I said to Jabir ibn Zayd, 'They claimthat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadedonkey's meat.' He said, 'Al-Hakam ibn 'Amr al-Ghifari used to say that whenhe was with us in Basra, but the great scholar, Ibn 'Abbas, refused to saythat and recited, <I>"Say: 'I do not find, in what has been revealed to me,any food unlawful to be eaten except for carrion, flowing blood, andpork...'"</I> (6:145)'"<P><P><B>XXIX. Eating beasts of prey with fangs</B><P>5210. It is related from Abu Idris al-Khawlani from Abu Tha'laba that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade everywild animal with fangs.<P>Yunus, Ma'mar, Ibn 'Uyayna and al-Majishun corroborated it from az-Zuhri.<P><P><B>XXX. The skins of carrion</B><P>5211. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, passed by a dead sheep and asked,"Why don't you use its skin?" They replied, "It is carrion." He said, "Itis only forbidden to eat it."<P>5212. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas was hear to say, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, passed by a dead goat and said, "There isnothing wrong in its people using its skin."<P><P><B>XXXI. Musk</B><P>5213. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "There is no one who is wounded in the Way ofAllah but that he will come on the Day of Rising with his wound bleeding.It will be the colour of blood but have the smell of musk."<P>5214. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "The metaphor of a good companion and a bad companionis that of someone possessing musk and the bellows of the blacksmith. Fromsomeone possessing musk you either buy it or smell its scent while the bellowsof the blacksmith either burn your body or your clothes or you smell a foulodour from them."<P><P><B>XXXII. Rabbits</B><P>5215. It is related that Anas said, "We made a rabbit bolt from its holeat Marr az-Zahran and the people ran after it but got tired. I caught itand brought it to Abu Talha. He sent its haunch &#150; or its thighs &#150;to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he acceptedthat."<P><P><B>XXXIII. Lizards</B><P>5216. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar said, "I heard Ibn 'Umar say that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I neither eat lizards norprohibit that."<P>5217. 'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas reported that Khalid ibn al-Walid went to thehouse of Maymuna with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace. [He said], "A roasted lizard was brought and the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stretched his hand to it.One of the women said, 'Tell the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, what he is about to eat.' They said, 'It is lizard,Messenger of Allah.' He removed his hand and I asked, 'Is it <I>haram</I>,Messenger of Allah?' 'No,' he answered, 'but it is not found in the landof my people and I find that I dislike it.'" Khalid said, "I pulled it tome and ate it while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was looking at me."<P><P><B>XXXIV. When a mouse falls into solid or liquid ghee</B><P>5218. Ibn 'Abbas reported from Maymuna that a mouse fell into some ghee anddied. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked aboutit and he said, "Throw it away along with what is around it, and eat therest."<P>It was said to Sufyan, "Ma'mar related it from az-Zuhri from Sa'id ibnal-Musayyab from Abu Hurayra." He said, "I only heard az-Zuhri say that itwas from 'Ubaydullah from Ibn 'Abbas from Maymuna from the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and I heard it from him several times."<P>5219. It is related from az-Zuhri about an animal which died in oil or ghee,solid or not solid, be it a mouse or another animal that he said, "It reachedus that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,commanded when a mouse died in ghee that what was close to it be thrown awayand the rest eaten."<P>It is from the <I>hadith</I> of 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah.<P>5220. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that Maymuna said, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was asked about a mouse which had falleninto ghee and he said, 'Throw it away along with what is around it and eatthe rest.'"<P><P><B>XXXV. Branding and marking the faces</B><P>5221. It is related from Salim that Ibn 'Umar disliked marking the face.<P>Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadestriking [the face.]<P>Qutayba corroborated it from al-'Anqazi from Hanzala, saying, "striking theface."<P>5222. It is related that Anas said, "I brought a brother of mine to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so that he could do tahnik (rubhis gums with a chewed date). He was in a sheep-pen of his and I saw himbranding a sheep." I reckon that he said, "on the ear."<P><P><B>XXXVI. When some people obtain booty and then some of them slaughter somesheep or camels without the permission of their companions, that should notbe eaten</B><P>This is based on a <I>hadith</I> of Rafi' from the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace.<P>Tawus and 'Ikrima said about a slaughtered stolen animal, "Throw it away."<P>5223. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij said, "I said to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, 'We will meet the enemy tomorrow andnot have any knives.' He said, 'Use whatever makes the blood flow and eatit when the Name of Allah has been mentioned over it as long as it is nota tooth or nail, and I will tell you about that. A tooth is a bone and thenail is the knife of the Abyssinians.' Some hasty people got ahead and tooksome booty while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wasbehind the people. They had set up pots and the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, ordered that they be tipped out. He divided theanimals between them and made one camel equal to ten sheep. Then a camelbelonging to the first group of people ran away and they had no horses withthem. A man shot an arrow at it and Allah stopped it. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Some of these animals are wild likewild animals. If one of them does this, then do as this man did.'"<P><P><B>XXXVII. When a camel belonging to some people runs away and one of themshoots an arrow at it and kills it intending their benefit, that ispermitted</B><P>It is based on a report of Rafi' from the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace.<P>5224. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij said, "We were with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and one of the camelsran away. A man shot it with an arrow an stopped it. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Some of them are wild like wild beasts.If you loose control over them, then do as this man did.'" He said, "I said,'Messenger of Allah, when we are on expeditions or journeys, we want to slaughterbut have no knives.' He said, 'Listen, use what males the blood flow andmention the Name of Allah and then eat it, unless it is a tooth or a nail.The tooth is a bone and the nail is the Abyssinian knife.'"<P><P><B>XXXVIII. What someone compelled by necessity can eat</B><P>By the words of the Almighty<I>, "You who believe! Eat of the good thingsWe have provided for you and show thanks to Allah if you worship Him alone.He has only forbidden you carrion, blood and pork and what has been consecratedto other than Allah. But anyone who is forced to eat it &#150; without desiringit or going to excess in it &#150; commits no crime." </I>(2:172-173)<P>He says,<I> "But if anyone is forced by hunger, not intending any wrongdoing..."</I>(5:3)<P>His words, <I>"Eat that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned,if you believe in His Signs. What is the matter with you that you do noteat that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned, when He has madeplain to you what He has forbidden you &#150; except when you are forcedto eat it? Many people misguide others by their whims and desires withoutany knowledge. Your Lord knows best those who overstep the limits."</I>(6:118-119)<P><I>"Say: 'I do not find, in what has been revealed to me, any food unlawfulto be eaten except for carrion, flowing blood, and pork &#150; for that isunclean &#150; or some deviance consecrated to other than Allah. But if anyoneis forced to eat it, without desiring to or going to excess in it, your Lordis Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'</I>" (6:145)<P><I>"So eat from what Allah has provided for you, lawful and good, and bethankful for the blessing of Allah if it is truly Him you worship. He hasforbidden you carrion, blood and pork and anything consecrated to other thanAllah. But if someone is forced to eat it, without desiring to or going toexcess in it, your Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful."</I> (16:114-115)<P><P><B><BIG><A NAME="sacrifice">Chapter 76. Book of Sacrifices</A></BIG></B><P><P><B>I. The sunna of sacrifice (<I>adhiyya</I>)</B>*<P>[*The animals sacrificed on 'Id al-Adha at the end of the hajj.]<P>Ibn 'Umar said that is a <I>sunna</I> and charity.<P>5225. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'The first thing we do on this day of ours ispray and then we go back and slaughter. Whoever does that has followed ourSunna. Whoever sacrifices before the prayer, that is just meat which he haspresented to his family and it is not a hajj rite at all.' Abu Burda ibnDinar, who had slaughtered, stood up and said, 'I have a young she-goat.'He said, 'Slaughter it, but it will not be enough for anyone after you.'"<P>'Amir reported that al-Bara' said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'Anyone who slaughters after the prayer has completedhis rite and followed the sunna of the Muslims."<P>5226. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "If someone slaughters before the prayer,he was slaughtered for himself. If someone slaughters after the prayer, hehas completed his rite and followed the <I>sunna</I> of the Muslims."<P><P><B>II. The imam distributing the sacrifices among the people</B><P>5227. It is related that 'Uqba ibn 'Amir al-Juhani said, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, distributed the sacrifices between hisCompanions and 'Uqba got a young she-goat. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, doI get a young she-goat?' He said, 'Sacrifice it.'"<P><P><B>III. Sacrifices on behalf of travellers and women</B><P>5228. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, came to her since she had menstruated at Sarif before enteringMakka. She was weeping and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, asked, "What is the matter? Have you started your period?" "Yes,"she replied. He said, "This is something that Allah has decreed for the daughtersof Adam, so do everything that someone on hajj does but do not do<I>tawaf</I> of the House." She said, "When we were at Mina, I was broughtsome beef and I asked, 'What is this?' They said, 'The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sacrificed a cow on behalf of hiswives.'"<P><P><B>IV. Meat which is desired on the Day of Sacrifice</B><P>5229. Ibn Sirin related that Anas ibn Malik said, "Anyone who has sacrificedbefore the prayer should sacrifice again. A man stood up and said, 'Thisis a day when meat is desired,' and he mentioned some of his neighbours.'I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep.'So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave him a dispensationto sacrifice that. I do not know whether the dispensation extended to otherthan him or not. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,went to two rams and slaughtered them and the people went to some sheep anddivided them &#150; or distributed &#150; them."<P><P><B>V. The one who says that al-Adha is the Day of Sacrifice</B><P>5230. It is related from from Abu Bakra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Time has continued cyclically in the sameway since the day Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is twelvemonths, four of which are sacred. Three are consecutive: Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l-Hijjaand al-Muharram, and there is Rajab of Mudar which is between Jumada andSha'ban. What month is this?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best."He was silent so that we thought that he might call it something different.He said, "Is this not Dhu'l-Hijja?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "What townis this?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He was silent sothat we thought that he might call it something different. He said, "Is thisnot the town?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "What day is this?" We said, "Allahand His Messenger know best." He was silent so that we thought that he mightcall it something different. He said, "Is this not the Day of Sacrifice?"We said, "Indeed." He said, "Your blood and your property [Muhammad said,"And I think that he also said, 'your honour"] are sacred to you, like thesacredness of this day in this month in this place. You will meet your Lordand He will ask you about your actions. So do not revert to misguidance afterI have gone, cutting each other's throats. Let those who are present conveyto those who are absent. Perhaps the one to whom it is conveyed will retainit better than those who heard it." [When Muhammad mentioned it, he usedto say, "The&nbsp;Prophet may Allah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;spokethe truth."] Then he said, "Have I not conveyed it? Have I not conveyed it?"<P><P><B>VI. <I>Adha</I> and slaughtering at the prayer place</B><P>5231. It is related that Nafi' said, "'Abdullah used to slaughter at theslaughter place." 'Ubaydullah said, "He means the slaughter place of theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>5232. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;used to slaughter and sacrificeat the place of the prayer."<P><P><B>VII. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, slaughteredtwo horned rams, and it is mentioned that they were fat</B><P>Abu Umama ibn Sahl said, "We used to fatten sacrifices in Madina, and theMuslims used to fatten them."<P>5233. It is related that 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn Suhayl said that he heard Anasibn Malik say, "The Prophet,&nbsp;may Allah bless him&nbsp;and grant himpeace, used to sacrifice two rams. I used to sacrifice two rams.<P>5234. Abu Qilaba related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, went to two black and white horned rams andslaughtered them with his own hands."<P>Wuhayb corroborated it from Ayyub. Isma'il and Hatim ibn Wardan said thatit from Ayyub from Ibn Sirin.<P>5235. It is related from 'Uqba ibn 'Amir that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, gave him some sheep to distribute between his Companionsas sacrifices. A yearling kid remained. He mentioned it to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, who said, 'You yourself sacrifice it.'"<P><P><B>VIII. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"Sacrifice a young goat, but it will not be enough for anyone after you."</B><P>5236. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "A maternal uncle of minecalled Abu Burda sacrificed before the prayer and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'Your sheep is justmeat.' He said, 'Messenger of Allah, in my house I have a young kid.' Hesaid, 'Slaughter it, but that will not be enough for anyone else.' Then hesaid, 'If someone slaughters before the prayer, he has slaughtered for himself.If someone slaughters after the prayer, he has completed his rite and followedthe sunna of the Muslims."<P>'Ubayda corroborated it from ash-Sha'bi and Ibrahim. Waki' corroborated itfrom Hurayth from ash-Sha'bi. 'Asim and Dawud quoted from ash-Sha'bi, "Ihave a young goat." Zubayd and Firas have from ash-Sha'bi, "I have a yearlingkid." Abu'l-Ahwas said that Mansur reported to him, "a young yearling goat."Ibn 'Awn said, "a young goat."<P>5237. It is related that al-Bara' said, "Abu Burda slaughtered before theprayer and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told him,'Do another in its place.' He said, 'I only have a young goat." (Shu'ba said,'I reckon that he said, 'It is better than an old sheep enough for anyoneafter you.'"<P>It is related from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and he said, "a young yearling goat".<P><P><B>IX. The one who slaughters the sacrificial animals with his own hand</B><P>5238. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, slaughtered two black and white rams. I saw him place hisfoot on their sides, say the Name of Allah and the <I>takbir</I> and thenslaughter them with his own hand."<P><P><B>X. Someone slaughtering the sacrifice of another person</B><P>A man helped Ibn 'Umar with his camel.<P>Abu Musa ordered his daughters to sacrifice with their own hands.<P>5239. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, came to her at Sarif when I was weeping. He asked, 'Whatis the matter? Have you started your period?' 'Yes,' she replied. He said,"This is something that Allah has decreed for the daughters of Adam, so doeverything that someone on hajj does but do not do tawaf of the House." TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sacrificed somecows on behalf of his wives."<P><P><B>XI. Slaughtering after the prayer</B><P>5240. It is related that al-Bara' said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, giving a <I>khutba</I> and he said, 'The first thingwe do on this day of ours is pray and then we go back and slaughter. Whoeverdoes that has followed our Sunna. If someone sacrifices before the prayer,that is just meat which he has presented to his family and it is not a<I>hajj</I> rite at all.' Abu Burda said, 'Messenger of Allah, I slaughteredbefore I prayed. I have a young she-goat which is better than an old one.'He said, 'Slaughter it in its place, but it will not be enough - or fulfilit &#150; for anyone after you.'"<P><P><B>XII. Whoever slaughters before the prayer should sacrifice another inits place</B><P>5241. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "Whoever slaughters before the prayer should repeat it."A man said, "This is a day when meat is desired," and he mentioned some ofhis neighbours. It seemed that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, excused him. He said, "I have a young she-goat which is dearerto me than the meat of two sheep." So the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, gave him the dispensation to sacrifice that. I do not knowwhether the dispensation extended to other than him or not. Then the Prophet*went to two rams and slaughtered them and the people went to some sheep andslaughtered them."<P>5242. It is related that Jundub ibn Sufyan al-Bajali said, "On the Day ofSacrifice I was present when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'Anyone who has sacrificed before the prayer shouldsacrifice another in its place. Anyone who has not yet sacrificed shouldsacrifice.'"<P>5243. It is related that al-Bara' said, "One day the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed and then said, 'Whoever praysour prayer and faces our qibla should not slaughter until he finishes.' AbuBurda ibn Niyar said, 'Messenger of Allah! I have already done it!' He said,'That is something you have done before its time.' He said, 'I have a younggoat which is better than two old sheep.

When someone sends his sacrificial camels to be slaughtered, he hasno state of <I>ihram</I> </B><P>5246. It is related from ash-Sha'bi that Masruq went to 'A'isha and saidto her, "Umm al-Mu'minin, there is a man who sends the sacrificial camelsto the Ka'ba while he remains in his city and gives instructions that hiscamels be garlanded and then he remains in <I>ihram</I> from that day peoplecome out of <I>ihram</I>." He said, "I could hear her clap from behind thescreen. Then she said, 'I used to plait the garlands of the sacrificial camelsof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He wouldsend his camels to the Ka'ba, but nothing was unlawful to him which is lawfulfor a man to do with his wife until the people returned [i.e. he did notassume a state of <I>ihram</I>].'"<P><P><B>XVI.

He said more thanonce, "The meat of the <I>hady</I>s."<P>5248. Al-Qasim related that Ibn Khabbab heard Abu Sa'id recount that he wasabsent and then, when he arrived, some meat was offered to him. They said,"This is part of the meat of our sacrifices." He said, Take it away! I willnot taste it!" He said, "Then I got up and went out and went to my brotherAbu Qatada (they were brothers through their mother, and he was one of thosewho had been at Badr) and mentioned that to him, and he said, 'A commandwas given while you were away."<P>5249. Yazid ibn Abi 'Ubayd related from Salama ibn al-Akwa' that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever of you sacrificesshould not still have any of it with him in his house after three days."The following year they asked, "Messenger of Allah, should we do what wedid last year?" He answered, 'Eat, feed others and store it. That year thepeople were experiencing hardship and I wanted you to help them."<P>5250. It is related from 'Amra bint 'Abdu'r-Rahman that 'A'isha said, "Weused to salt some of the meat of sacrifices and bring it to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in Madina. He said, 'Do not eatfrom it for more than three days.' That was not a definitive prohibition,but he wanted the people to be fed from it, and Allah knows best.'"<P>5251. it is related from Abu 'Ubayd, the mawla of Ibn Azhar, that he waspresent at the <I>'Id al-Adha </I>with 'Umar ibn al-Khattab. 'Umar prayedbefore the <I>khutba</I> and then addressed the people, saying. "O people!The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadeyou to fast on these two<I> 'Id</I>s. One is the Day of <I>Fitr</I>, whenyou break your fast. The other is the day when you eat your sacrifices."<P>Abu 'Ubayd said, "Then I was present with 'Uthman ibn 'Affan. It was on aFriday and he prayed before the <I>khutba</I> and then addressed the people,saying, 'O people! This is a day in which you have two '<I>id</I>s. Whoeverof the people of al-'Awali* who wants to wait for Jumu'a should wait, andI have given permission to whoever wants to return."<P>Abu 'Ubayd said, "Then I was present with 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and he prayedbefore the <I>khutba</I> and then addressed the people, saying. 'The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has forbidden you to eatfrom the meat of your sacrifices for more than three days.'"<P>The like of it is related from Ma'mar from az-Zuhri from Abu 'Ubayd.<P>[al-'Awali: the towns next to Madina to the east.]<P>5252.

It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab heard from Abu Hurayra reportthat during the Night Journey, at Jerusalem the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was brought two cups, one of wine and oneof milk. He looked at them and then took the milk. Jibril said, "Praise beto Allah who has guided you to the natural form! If you had taken the wine,your community would have erred."<P>Ma'mar, Ibn al-Hadi, 'Uthman ibn 'Umar and az-Zubaydi corroborated it fromaz-Zuhri.<P>5255. Qatada related that Anas said, "I heard a <I>hadith</I> from the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which none other thanme will relate to you. He said, "Among the signs of the Final Hour are theappearance of ignorance, lessening of knowledge, the appearance of fornication,drinking of wine, and men decreasing and women increasing until there willbe one man to care for fifty women.'"<P>5256. It is related from Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman and Ibn Musayyab thatAbu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "A fornicator is not a believer at the moment he fornicates, someonewho drinks wine is not a believer at the moment he drinks, and a thief isnot a believer at the moment when steals."<P>5257. Ibn Shihab said, "'Abdu'l-Malik ibn Abi Bakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibnal-Harith ibn Hisham reported to me that Abu Bakr had narrated it to himfrom Abu Bakr.

Someone came and said, 'Winehas been forbidden.' Abu Talha said, 'Anas, get up and pour it out.' So Ipoured it out."<P>5262. It is related that Anas was heard to say, "I was standing in our clantribe serving drink to my uncles. I was the youngest of them. It was datewine. It was said, 'Wine has been forbidden.' They said, 'Throw it out.'So I threw it out.'" The narrator said, "I asked Anas, 'What was their drink?'He answered, 'Fresh dates and unripe dates.' Abu Bakr ibn Anas said, 'Thatwas their wine.' Anas did not deny it."<P>One of my companions related to me that he heard Anas ibn Malik say, "Thatwas their wine at that time."<P>5263.

It is made from five things:grapes, dates, wheat, barley and honey. Wine is that which overpowers themind. I wish that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, had not left us until he had given us instructions about three matters:the [inheritance of a] grandfather, the inheritance of the person withoutheirs (<I>kalala</I>), and some types of usury.'"<P>He (Abu Hayyan) said, "I said, 'Abu 'Amr [i.e. ash-Sha'bi], what about somethingmade from rice in Sind?' He said, 'That did not exist in the time of theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace," or he said, 'in the timeof 'Umar."<P>It is reported from Abu Hayyan who has "raisins" in place of "grapes".<P>5267.

There willbe some people who will camp beside a mountain and a poor man will come tothem in the evening with some sheep of theirs and ask them for somethingand they will say, 'Come back to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them inthe night and the mountain will fall on them and He will change the restof them into monkeys and pigs until the Day of Rising."<P><P><B>VI.

She had soaked some dates in a small vessel overnightfor him."<P><P><B>VII.

He said, "Use them then."<P>This is related from Mansur from Salim ibn Abi'l-Ja'd.<P>Sufyan related this and in it he said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, forbade certain jars..."<P>5271. Mujahid related from Abu 'Iyad that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "Whenthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade certain drinkcontainers [for making <I>nabidh</I>], it was said to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, 'Not all people can find waterskins.' So heallowed the use of jars, but not those covered in pitch."<P>5272. It is related by al-Harith ibn Suwayd from 'Ali that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the the use of gourds and vesselscovered in pitch.<P>This is related from al-A'mash.<P>5273.

She answered, "He forbade us, the people of hishouse, to make <I>nabidh</I> in gourds and vessels covered in pitch." I said,"Did you mention earthernware and <I>hantam</I> (green oiled jars)?" Shesaid, "I relate to you what I heard. Shall I related to you what I did nothear?"'"<P>5274. Ash-Shaybani said, "I heard 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa say, 'The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the use of green jars.'I asked, 'Can we drink from white vessels?'

It is also called<I> tila'</I>]<P>'Umar, Abu 'Ubayda and Mu'adh thought that <I>tila' </I>was permissible ifit was reduced to a third. Al-Bara' and Abu Juhayfa drank it when it wasreduced to a half.<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "Drink juice when it is still fresh."<P>'Umar said, "I smelled drink on 'Ubaydullah. I will ask him about it. Ifit is an intoxicant, then I will flog him."<P>5276. Sufyan reported that Abu'l-Juwayriya said, "I asked Ibn 'Abbas aboutbadhiq and he said, 'Before there was badhiq, Muhammad, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, made a prohibition: "Whatever intoxicates is unlawful."'He said, 'The lawful wholesome drinks.'

Hisham related from Qatada that Anas said, "I served Abu Talha, AbuDujana and Suhayl ibn al-Bayda' a drink which was a mixture of unripe andripe dates. Then wine was made unlawful and so I threw it away. I was servingthem and was the youngest of them. We used to consider that to be wine."<P>'Amr ibn al-Harith reported that Qatada heard Anas...<P>5279. 'Ata' reported that he heard Jabir say, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, forbade [mixing] raisins, dates, unripe dates, andfresh dates [in making nabidh]."<P>[Note: the speed with the drink becomes intoxicating is thereby increased.]<P>5280.

Messenger of Allah, dispose of itin whatever way Allah shows you is best.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Excellent! That is a profitable(<I>rabih</I> or <I>rayih</I>. ('Abdullah was unsure about which word)) property.I have heard what you have said about it and I think that you should giveit to your relatives.'

The Shaytans spreadat that time. When an hour of the night has gone, then let them go, Lockthe doors and mention the name of Allah. Shaytan does not open a locked door.Tie up waterskins and mention the Name of Allah. Cover up containers andmention the Name of Allah, even by putting something across it. Put out yourlamps.'"<P>5301. 'Ata' related from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Put out the lamps when you go to bed, closethe doors, tie up the waterskins, and cover food and drinks," and I thinkthat he said, "even with a stick you put over it."<P><P><B>XXII.

'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudrisaid, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadeturning the mouths of waterskins inside out," i.e. breaking their mouthsin order to drink from them.<P>5303.

'Umayr, the client of Umm al-Fadl, reported from Umm al-Fadl that theywere uncertain about whether the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, was fasting on the Day of 'Arafa and so a cup of milk was sent tohim and he drank.<P><P><B>XXIX. Drinking from the cup and vessel of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace</B><P>Abu Burda said, "'Abdullah ibn Salam said to me, 'Shall I let you drink froma cup from which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, drank?'"<P>5314. Abu Hazim related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "An Arab woman* was mentionedto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he ordered AbuUsayd as-Sa'idi to send for her. He sent for her and she came and stayedin the fortress of the Banu Sa'ida. The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, went to her and entered where she was. There was a womanwith her head bowed. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, spoke to her, she said, 'I seek refuge with Allah from you.' He said,'I give you refuge from me.' They said to her, 'Do you know who this is?''No,' she replied. They said, 'This is the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, who has come to propose marriage to you.'She said, 'I was very unfortunate in that.' The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, then went and sat in the veranda of the Banu Sa'idawith his Companions. Then he said, 'Sahl, give us some water.' I broughtout this cup to them and let them drink from it." [Abu Hazim said,] "Sahlproduced that cup for us and we drank from it."<P>He said, "Then 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz later asked him to give it to him,and he gave it to him."<P>[*This was the Jawniyya woman.]<P>5315. Abu 'Awana related that 'Asim al-Ahwal said, "I saw the cup of theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with Anas ibn Malik. Ithad broken and he had bound it with silver." He said, "It was a excellentwide cup made of tamarisk wood. Anas said, 'I let the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, drink from this cup for more thansuch-and-such a time.'"<P>He said that Ibn Sirin said, "There was an iron ring around it. Anas wantedto replace it with a silver or gold ring, but Abu Talha told him, 'Do notchange anything that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, had done.' So he left it."<P><P><B>XXX. Drinking for the sake of the blessing and blessed water</B><P>5316. This hadith is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace. He said, "I remember when I was with the Prophetm mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and it was time for the 'Asr prayer.We had no water with us except a bit which was left over. It was put intoa vessel and brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.He put his hand in it and opened out his fingers. Then he said, 'Come, thosewho want to do wudu'. The blessing is from Allah.' I saw the water gushingfrom between his fingers. The people did wudu' and drank. I tried to drinkmore than I could put in my stomach of it because I knew that it was a blessing."Salim ibn Abi'l-Ja'd asked Jabir, "How many of you were there on that day?"He answered, "1400."<P>'Amr corroborated it from Jabir. Husayn and 'Amr ibn Murra said that it isfrom Salim from Jabir and is "1500." Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab corroborated itfrom Jabir.<P><P>  <HR><P ALIGN=Center><B><BIG><A HREF="bukhcont.html">Return to Contents</A></BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><BIG><B><A HREF="index.html">Return to Home Page</A></B></BIG><P><P></BODY></HTML>
