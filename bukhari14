<P>
<P>
<B>I: The obligation and excellence of <I>'umra</I></B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar , "There is no one for whom hajj and<I> 'umra </I>are not an
obligation." Ibn 'Abbas said, "They are joined together in the Book of Allah,
the Mighty and Exalted, <I>'Perform the hajj and 'umra.'</I> (2:196)"
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#66">1683</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "From
one<I> 'umra</I> to the next is expiation for everything in between them
and there is no reward for an accepted hajj other than the Garden."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Someone doing <I>'umra </I>before hajj</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#58">1684</A>. It is related from Ibn Jurayj that 'Ikrima
ibn Khalid asked Ibn 'Umar &nbsp;about performing<I> 'umra </I>before hajj
and he said, "There is no harm in it." 'Ikrima said that Ibn 'Umar said,
"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did <I>'umra </I>before
he did hajj."
<P>
Ibn Ishaq related that 'Ikrima ibn Khalid said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar the same
thing."
<P>
'Ikrima ibn Khalid said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar the same thing."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The number of times the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, did <I>'umra</I></B>
<P>
1685. It is related from Mujahid, "'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr and I entered the
mosque and found 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar sitting next to the room of 'A'isha.
Some other people were praying the <I>Duha</I> prayer in the mosque." Mujahid
said, "We asked him [Ibn 'Umar] about their prayer and he said, 'It is an
innovation.' Then he ['Urwa] said to him, 'How many times did the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do <I>'umra</I>?' He said, 'Four
times: once in Rajab.' We did not like to contradict him."
<P>
He said, "We heard 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin, cleaning her teeth in the room
and so 'Urwa said, 'O mother! O Umm al-Mu'minin! Do you not hear what Abu
'Abdu'r-Rahman is saying?' She said, 'What is he saying?' He said, 'He says
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went
on <I>'umra</I> four times, one of which was in Rajab.' She said, 'May Allah
have mercy on Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman. He did not do any <I>'umra </I>but that
he was present with him. He never went on <I>'umra </I>in Rajab.'"
<P>
1686. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said, "I asked 'A'isha and she
said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did
not go on <I>'umra </I>in Rajab."
<P>
1687. It is related from Qatada, "I asked Anas, 'How many times did the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, go on <I>'umra</I>?' He said, 'Four
- the <I>'umra </I>of al-Hudaybiya in Dhu'l-Qa'da when the idolaters stopped
him, the <I>'umra</I> in the following year in Dhu'l-Qa'da when he had a
treaty with them, and the <I>'umra </I>of al-Ji'rana when he divided the
booty.' I think it was Hunayn. I said, 'How many times did he go on hajj?'
He said, 'Once.'"
<P>
1688. It is related that Qatada said, "I asked Anas and he said, 'The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on 'umra when they made him
turn back, and in the year after the<I> 'umra </I>of al-Hudaybiyya, and he
did an<I> 'umra </I>in Dhu'l-Qa'da, and an<I> 'umra </I>with his hajj.'"
<P>
It is related the Hammam said, "He (the Prophet) went on <I>'umra</I> four
times, all of them in Dhu'l-Qa'da except when he did 'umra with his hajj:
his <I>'umra</I> from al-Hudaybiyya, that in the following year and that
from al-Ji'rana, when he divided the booty of Hunayn, and his 'umra with
his hajj."
<P>
1689. It is related that Abu Ishaq said, "I asked Masruq, 'Ata' and Mujahid
and they said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, went on <I>'umra</I> in Dhu'l-Qa'da before he went on hajj.'" He said,
"I heard al-Bara' ibn 'Azib say, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went on <I>'umra </I>in Dhu'l-Qa'da twice before
he went on hajj.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: <I>'Umra </I>during Ramadan</B>
<P>
1690. It is related that 'Ata' said, "I heard Ibn 'Abbas report to us, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to a woman
of the Ansar (Ibn 'Abbas named her but I have forgotten her name), 'What
kept you from going on <I>hajj</I> with us?' She said, 'We have an irrigation
camel and the father of so-and-so and his son (her husband and son) rode
it and left us only a single camel for irrigation.' He said, 'Then go on
<I>'umra </I>in Ramadan. An<I>'umra </I>in Ramadan is hajj.' or he said something
like it."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: <I>'Umra </I>on the night of the 13th of Dhu'l-Hijja and other nights</B>
<P>
1691. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We set out with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, just before the new moon
of Dhu'l-Hijja. He said to us, 'Any of you who want to go into <I>ihram</I>
for hajj should do so and those who want to go into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra
</I>should go into it for<I> 'umra</I>. If I had not brought a sacrifice
with me, I would have gone into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>.'" She said,
"Some of us went into <I>ihram</I> fo<I>r 'umra </I>and some of us went into
<I>ihram</I> for hajj. I was one of those who went into <I>ihram</I> for
<I>'umra</I>. When the day of 'Arafa approached, I was still menstruating,
so I complained to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said, 'Forget about your<I> 'umra</I>, unbraid your hair and comb
it and go into <I>ihram</I> for hajj.' On the night of the 13th, he sent
'Abdu'r-Rahman with me to at-Tan'im and I went into <I>ihram</I> for
<I>'umra</I> to compensate for my other <I>'umra</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The<I> 'umra </I>of at-Tan'im</B>
<P>
1692. It is related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, told him to let 'A'isha ride behind
him and to take her on <I>'umra </I>from at-Tan'im. Once Sufyan (one of the
narrators) said, "I heard it from 'Amr. How often I heard it from 'Amr!"
<P>
1693. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and his Companions went into <I>ihram</I> for hajj.
None of them had a sacrificial animal with them except for the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Talha. 'Ali arrived from the Yemen
with a sacrificial animal and said, 'I have gone into <I>ihram</I> with the
same intention as that with which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, went into <I>ihram</I>.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, ordered his Companions to make it<I> 'umra </I>and do
<I>tawaf</I> and then to shorten their hair and to come out of <I>ihram</I>
- except those who had sacrificial animals. They said, 'Can we go to Mina
when one of us says that he has just had a seminal discharge' That reached
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'If I
had known at the beginning of the business what I know at the end, I would
not have brought a sacrificial animal with me. If I did not have a sacrificial
animal with me, I would have come out of <I>ihram</I>.' 'A'isha got her menstrual
period and performed all the practices except for <I>tawaf</I>." He said,"When
she was pure, she did tawaf and said, 'Messenger of Allah, you are returning
with hajj and <I>'umra </I>when I am returning with only hajj?' So he commanded
'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr to go out with her to at-Tan'im and she did
<I>'umra </I>after hajj in the month of Dhu'l-Hijja. Suraqa ibn Malik ibn
Ju'sham met the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he
was stoning al-'Aqaba and asked him, 'Is this just for you, Messenger of
Allah?' He said, 'No, it is forever.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Doing <I>'umra </I>after hajj without having a sacrificial animal</B>
<P>
1694. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We set out with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, just before the new moon
of Dhu'l-Hijja. He said, 'Any of you who want to go into <I>ihram</I> fo<I>r
'umra</I> should do so and those who want to go into <I>ihram</I> for hajj
should go into it for hajj. If I had not brought a sacrifice with me, I would
have gone into <I>ihram</I> for<I> 'umra</I>.' Some people went into ihram
for 'umra and some of them went into <I>ihram</I> for hajj. I was one of
those who went into <I>ihram</I> fo<I>r 'umra</I>. I started menstruating
before I entered Makka. When the day of 'Arafa came, I was still menstruating,
so I complained to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said, 'Leave your <I>'umra</I>, unbraid your hair and comb it and
go into <I>ihram</I> for <I>hajj</I>.' I did that. On the night of the 13th,
he sent 'Abdu'r-Rahman with me to at-Tan'im." He let her ride behind him
and she went into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>to compensate for her other<I>
'umra </I>so Allah fulfilled both her hajj and<I> 'umra</I>. She was not
required to sacrifice nor to give <I>sadaqa</I> nor to fast.
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The reward of the<I> 'umra </I>is according to the effort exerted</B>
<P>
1695. It is related from al-Aswad, "'A'isha said, 'Messenger of Allah, is
everyone going to return with two acts of worship while I am only returning
with one?' She was told, 'Wait, and when you are pure, go out to at-Tan'im
and go into <I>ihram</I>. Then meet us at such-and-such a place. But it is
according to what you spend and the effort you exert.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: When someone doing <I>'umra </I>leaves after doing the <I>tawaf</I>
of <I>'umra</I>, can that be considered the <I>Tawaf</I> of Farewell?</B>
<P>
1696. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We set out with the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, going into <I>ihram</I> for hajj in
the months of hajj and the sacred places of the <I>hajj</I>. We halted at
Sarif and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told his
Companions, 'Anyone who does not have a sacrificial animal with them and
wants to make it <I>'umra </I>should do so. Anyone who has a sacrificial
animal with him should not.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and some men of his wealthier Companions had sacrificial animals so
they did not do <I>'umra</I>. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, came upon me while I was weeping and said, 'Why are you weeping?'
I said, 'I heard you say what you said to your Companions and I am prevented
from doing <I>'umra</I>.' He said, 'What is the matter with you?' I said,
'I am not praying.' He said, 'It doesn't matter. You are one of the daughters
of Adam and what is written for them is written for you. Do your hajj and
perhaps Allah will give you a way.'" She said, "When were were leaving Mina,
we halted at al-Muhassab and he called 'Abdu'r-Rahman and said, 'Go out with
your sister to the Haram. She should go into <I>ihram</I> for 'umra. Then
complete your<I> 'umra</I>. I will wait for you here.' We returned in the
middle of the night and he asked, 'You have both finished?' I said, 'Yes.'
So he announced the departure among his Companions, and everyone set out.
Some had done <I>tawaf</I> of the House before the <I>Subh</I> prayer. Then
he left heading for Madina."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Doing in <I>'umra </I>the same as is done in hajj</B>
<P>
1697. Safwan ibn Ya'la ibn Umayya related from his father, "While the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and <I>grant</I> him peace, was at al-Ji'rana with some
of his Companions, a man came to him wearing a cloak which had traces of
khaluq-perfume (or he said, 'yellowness') on it and said, 'What do you order
me to do in my <I>'umra</I>?' Revelation came to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and he was shaded by a cloth. I had been wanting
to see the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when the revelation
was descending on him. 'Umar said, 'Come on, would you like to see the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when Allah is sending down the
revelation on him?' I said, 'Yes.' So he lifted a corner of the cloth and
I looked at him and he was snoring. (I think he said, 'Snoring like a young
camel.') When the state left him, he said, 'Where is the man who asked about<I>
'umra</I>? Take off your cloak, wash off the trace of <I>khaluq</I> from
yourself and then wash away the yellowness. Do the same in your<I> 'umra</I>
as you do in your hajj.'"
<P>
1698. It is related that 'Urwa said, "When I was young I asked 'A'isha, the
wife of the Prophet, 'What do you think of the words of Allah the Blessed
and Almighty, "<I>Safa and Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks of Allah,
so anyone who goes on hajj to the House or does 'umra incurs no wrong in
going back and forth between them." </I>(2:158) By Allah, so there is nothing
wrong in someone not going between Safa and Marwa' She said, 'My nephew,
if it was as you say, it would have been, "...incurs no wrong in&nbsp;not
going back and forth between of them." However, it was sent down about the
Ansar who used previously to go into <I>ihram</I> for the idol Manat which
was opposite Qudayd. They considered it to be a sin to go betweenf Safa and
Marwa. When Islam came, they asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, about that and Allah Alimighty sent down, '<I>Safa
and Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks of Allah, so anyone who goes on
hajj to the House or does 'umra incurs no wrong in going back and forth between
them.</I>'"
<P>
Sufyan and Abu Mu'awiya related from Hisham, "Allah does not consider the
hajj or<I> 'umra </I>of any person to be complete until they have gone between
Safa and Marwa."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: When someone doing <I>'umra </I>leaves <I>ihram</I></B>
<P>
Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded
that they make it <I>'umra</I> and do <I>tawaf</I> and then to shorten their
hair and come out of <I>ihram</I>."
<P>
1699. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did <I>'umra </I>and we did <I>'umra
</I>with him. When he entered Makka, he did <I>tawaf</I> and we did
<I>tawaf</I> with him. He went to Safa and Marwa and we also went to them
with him. We used to shield him from the people of Makka in case one of them
tried to shoot him."
<P>
A friend of mine asked him, "Did he enter the Ka'ba?" He replied, "No." He
went on, "He related to us what he said about Khadija. He said, 'Give Khadija
the good news that she will have a house in the Garden made of jewelled piping.
There will be no clamour there and no tiredness.'"
<P>
1700. It is related that 'Amr ibn Dinar said, "We asked Ibn 'Umar about whether
a man, who does <I>tawaf</I> of the House in <I>'umra</I> but has not yet
gone between Safa and Marwa, is permitted to go to his wife? He said, 'The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, arrived and did seven circuits
of the House and prayed two <I>rak'ats </I>behind the Maqam and went between
Safa and Marwa seven times. You have a good example in the Messenger of Allah.'
<P>
He said, "We asked Jabir ibn 'Abdullah and he said, 'He should not approach
her until he has gone between Safa and Marwa.'"
<P>
1701. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "I came to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was halted at al-Batha'.
He asked, 'Are you on <I>hajj</I>?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'With what
intention have you gone into <I>ihram</I>?' I answered, 'At your service!
I have gone into <I>ihram</I> with the same intention as that of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said, 'You have done well. Do
<I>tawaf</I> of the House and of Safa and Marwa. Then come out of
<I>ihram</I>.' I did <I>tawaf</I> of the House and Safa and Marwa and then
I went to a woman of Qays who deloused my head. Then later I went into
<I>ihram</I> for the hajj. I used to transmit that judgement until the khalifate
of 'Umar. He said, 'If we take the Book of Allah, it commands us to complete
hajj and <I>'umra</I>. If we take the record of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, he did not come out of <I>ihram</I> until the sacrifice
reached its place.'"
<P>
1702. It is related from 'Abdullah, the mawla of Asma' bint Abi Bakr that
whenever Asma' passed by al-Hajun, he heard her say, "May Allah bless His
Messenger, Muhammad. We halted here with him and on that day we were travelling
light with few mounts and little provision. I and my sister 'A'isha, az-Zubayr
and so-and-so and so-and-so went o<I>n 'umra</I>. When we touched the Ka'ba,
we came out of <I>ihram</I>. Then in the evening we assumed on <I>ihram</I>
for hajj."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: What to say on returning from <I>hajj</I>, <I>'umra</I> or a raiding
expedition</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#252">1703</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar,
"When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, returned
from a raiding party, hajj or<I> 'umra</I>, he would say the <I>takbir</I>
three times on every hilltop. Then he would say, 'There is no god but Allah
alone with no partner. His is the kingdom and His the praise. He has power
over all things. [We are] returning, repenting, worshipping, prostrating
to our Lord, in praise. Allah has been true to His promise and helped His
slave and alone defeated the parties.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Welcoming the people arriving back from hajj. Three people riding
on one animal</B>
<P>
1704. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, arrived in Makka, some boys of the Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib
met him and he mounted one of them in front of him and another behind him."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Arriving in the morning</B>
<P>
1705. It is related from 'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar that when the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left for Makka, he would pray in
the ash-Shajara mosque, and when he returned, he would pray at Dhu'l-Hulayfa
at the bottom of the valley and would stay the night there until morning.
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Coming back in the afternoon</B>
<P>
1706. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to not return to his family at night. He would only
arrive in the morning or the afternoon."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Not going to the family at night when arriving late in the city</B>
<P>
1707. It is related that Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace,&nbsp;forbade people to return to their family during the
night."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Someone spurring on his camel upon reaching his city</B>
<P>
1708. It is related that Humayd heard Anas say, "When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, returned from a journey and saw
the high parts of Madina, he would spur on his she-camel. If he was on a
donkey, then he would prod it."
<P>
Humayd added, "He spurred it on because of his love for Madina."
<P>
It is related that Anas said, "Walls."
<P>
Al-Harith ibn 'Umayr corroborated it.
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Enter houses by their doors."</I>
(2:189)</B>
<P>
1709. It is related that Abu Ishaq heard al-Bara' say, "This verse was revealed
about us. When the Ansar went on hajj, they used not to enter their houses
by their doors, when they came back, but from the back. A man of the Ansar
came and entered by his door and was apparently condemned for it. Then it
was revealed:<I> 'It is not devoutness for you to enter houses by the back.
Rather devoutness is possessed by those who fear Allah. So come to houses
by their doors.'</I>" (2:189)
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Travelling is a form of punishment</B>
<P>
1710. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Travelling is a form of punishment. It deprives
a person of his food and drink and sleep. When he finishes what he has to
do, he should hurry back to his family."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: A traveller pushing on in his journey hurrying back to his family
</B>
<P>
1711. It is related that Zayd ibn Aslam's father said, "I was with 'Abdullah
ibn 'Umar on the Makka road when he heard that Safiyya bint Abi 'Ubayd, was
very ill. He hurried on until after nightfall when he alighted and prayed
<I>Maghrib</I> and <I>'Isha' </I>together. Then he said, 'When the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was travelling in a hurry, I saw
him delay <I>Maghrib</I> and join the two of them.'"

Hajj or 'Umra and the Requital For hunting</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: The <I>muhsar</I> [one prevented from completing hajj or <I>'umra</I>]
and the requital for hunting</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"If you are forcibly prevented, make whatever
sacrifice is feasible. But do not shave your heads until the sacrificial
animal has reached the place of sacrifice."</I> (2:196)
<P>
'Ata said, "<I>Ihsar</I> from anything means to be kept from it." Abu 'Abdullah
said, "'<I>Hasur</I>' (3:39) means he does not go to his women."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: When someone making <I>'umra </I>is stopped</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#42">1712</A>. It is related from Nafi' that when Ibn 'Umar
went out to Makka on <I>'umra</I> during the Civil War (<I>fitna</I>), he
said, "If I am barred from the House, I will do what we did with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. I will go into
<I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went into <I>ihram</I> for<I> 'umra </I>in the year
of al-Hudaybiyya."
<P>
[This was between al-Hajjaj and Ibn az-Zubayr.]
<P>
1713. It is related from Nafi' that 'Ubaydullah and Salim ibn 'Abdullah informed
him that in the nights when the army was attacking Ibn az-Zubayr, they said
to 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, "It will not harm you not to go on hajj this year.
We fear that they will come between you and the House." He said, "We went
out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
when the unbelievers of Quraysh were between him and the House. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sacrificed his sacrificial animal
and shaved his head. I testify to you that I have gone into <I>ihram</I>
to do 'umra. If Allah wills, I will go and if the way is clear between me
and the House, I will do <I>tawaf</I>. If something comes between me and
it, I will do as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did
when I was with him." He went into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>from
Dhu'l-Hulayfa and then travelled for a time and then said, "They are the
same. I testify to you that I have gone into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>and
hajj." He did not come out of <I>ihram</I> until the Day of Sacrifice and
he had made his sacrifice. He used to say, "You cannot come out of
<I>ihram</I> until you have done one <I>tawaf</I> on the day you enter Makka."
<P>
It is related from Nafi' that some of the Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib said to him,
"If only you had stayed [home] that year."
<P>
1714. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was kept from doing <I>'umra</I> and so he
shaved his head, resumed sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered
his sacrifice until he did<I> 'umra</I> in the following year."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Being prevented from doing <I>hajj</I></B>
<P>
1715. It is related that Ibn 'Umar used to say, "Is not the sunna of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, enough for you?
If one of you is prevented from doing <I>hajj</I>, he should do <I>tawaf</I>
of the House and Safa and Marwa and then come out of <I>ihram</I> completely
until he does hajj in the following year and he should make a sacrifice or
fast if he cannot sacrifice."
<P>
The like of it is related from Salim from Ibn 'Umar.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Sacrificing before shaving the head if someone is prevented from making
hajj</B>
<P>
1716. It is related from al-Miswar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sacrificed before he shaved and commanded
his Companions to do that.
<P>
1717. It is related from Nafi' from 'Abdullah and Salim that 'Abdullah ibn
'Umar said, "We went out with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and the unbelievers of Quraysh came between him and the House.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sacrificed
his sacrificial animals and shaved his head."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Someone saying that the <I>muhsar</I> does not have to make it up</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "Making up is only for the one who breaks his hajj of his
own volition. Someone who is prevented for a valid reason or something else,
should come out of ihram and does not have to make it up. If he has a sacrificial
animal with him and he is prevented from completing it, he should sacrifice
it if he cannot send it (to the place of sacrifice). If he can send it, he
should not come out of <I>ihram</I> until the sacrifice reaches its place.
<P>
Malik and others said, "He should sacrifice his animal and shave his head
wherever he is and does not have to make it up because the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and his Companions at al-Hudaybiyya sacrificed
and shaved their heads and came out of <I>ihram</I> completely before doing
tawaf and before the sacrifice reached the House. And it is not mentioned
that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded anyone
to make anything up nor to repeat it. Al-Hudaybiyya is outside the Haram."
<P>
1718. It is related from Nafi' that when 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar went out to
Makka during the sedition, he said, "If I am barred from the House, we will
do as we did with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace." He went into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I> because the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had gone into <I>ihram</I> for
<I>'umra</I> in the year of al-Hudaybiyya. Then 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar thought
about the matter and said, "Their nature is the same." He looked at his
Companions and said, "Their nature is the same. I testify to you that I have
gone into <I>ihram</I> for hajj with<I> 'umra</I>." Then he did one
<I>tawaf</I>, for both of them, and considered that to be enough, and sacrificed.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"If any of you are ill or have a head
injury, the expiation is fasting or sadaqa or sacrifice." </I>(2:196)</B>
<P>
He can choose. The fast is for three days.
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#247">1719</A>. It is related from Ka'b ibn 'Ujra that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Is
it that your lice are troubling you?" He said, "Yes, Messenger of Allah."
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Shave
your head and fast for three days or feed poor people or sacrifice a sheep."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The words of Allah, "or <I>sadaqa</I>" which refers to feeding poor
people</B>
<P>
1720. It is related from Ka'b ibn 'Ujra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing with me at al-Hudaybiyya
and lice were falling from my head. He said, 'Are your lice troubling you?'
I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Shave your head (or 'shave').' He said, 'This verse
was sent down: <I>"If any of you are ill or have a head injury.."</I> to
the end.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Fast
for three days or give one <I>faraq</I> as <I>sadaqa</I> for six people,
or sacrifice what is feasible.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The expiation (<I>fidya</I>) for feeding people is half a
<I>sa'</I></B>
<P>
1721. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Ma'qal said, "I sat with Ka'b ibn
'Ujra and asked him about <I>fidya</I>. He said, 'It was revealed about me
but it applies generally to you as well. I was carried to the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with the lice falling on
my face.' He said, 'I did not think that pain could reach what I see in you
(or 'your struggle could reach what I see in you'.) Can you get a sheep?'
I said, 'No.' He said, ' Fast for three days or feed six poor people with
half a <I>sa</I>' for every poor person.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: <I>Nusuk</I> (compensatory sacrifice) consists of a sheep</B>
<P>
1722. It is related from Ka'b ibn 'Ujra that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw him and lice were falling on his
face. He said, "Are your lice troubling you?" He said, "Yes." He instructed
him to shave his head while he was at al-Hudaybiyya. It was not clear to
them whether they should come out of <I>ihram</I> there for they were still
hoping to enter Makka. So Allah revealed the <I>fidya</I> and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded him to feed
six people with one <I>faraq</I> or sacrifice a sheep or fast for three days.
<P>
It is similarly related from Ka'b ibn 'Ujra that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw him and lice were falling on
his face.
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"No sexual intercourse..."</I></B><I>
</I><B>(2:197)</B>
<P>
1723. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever does <I>hajj</I> to this House
and does not have sexual relations nor commit wrongdoing will return as he
was on the day on which his mother bore him.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The words of Allah the Mighty and Exalted, <I>"no wrongdoing nor any
quarrelling in the hajj." </I>(2:197)</B>
<P>
1724. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever does hajj for Allah and does not
have sexual relations nor commit wrongdoing will return as he was on the
day on which his mother bore him.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: The words of Allah Almighty:</B>
<P>
<I>"Do not kill game while you are in ihram. If one of you kills any
deliberately, the reprisal for it is a livestock animal equivalent to what
he killed, as judged by two just men among you, a sacrifice to reach the
Ka'ba, or expiation by feeding the poor, or fasting commensurate to that,
so that he may taste the evil consequences of what he did. Allah has pardoned
what took place in the past; but if anyone does it again Allah will take
revenge on him. Allah is Almighty, Exactor of Revenge. What you catch in
the sea is lawful for you, and all food from it, for your enjoyment and that
of travellers, but land game is unlawful for you while you are in ihram.
So show fear of Allah, Him to whom you will be gathered." </I>(5:95-96)
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: When someone not in <I>ihram</I> hunts game and gives it to the
<I>muhrim</I>, the <I>muhrim</I> can eat it</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas and Anas did not see anything wrong in slaughtering animals which
were not game - like camels, sheep, cattle, chickens and horses.
<P>
<I>'Adl </I>is said to mean "like". When it is<I> 'idl</I>, it is the weight
of that. <I>Qiyaman</I> (5:96) is <I>qiwaman</I> and <I>ya'dilun</I> (6:1)
is to give someone an equal amount.
<P>
1725. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Qatada said, "My father set out
in the year of al-Hudaybiyya. His companions went into <I>ihram</I>, but
he did not. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was informed
that an enemy would attack him at Ghayqa. So the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went ahead. While my father was with his companions,
some of them started laughing among themselves. &#180;I looked and there
was a wild ass. I attacked it and stabbed it and brought it. I asked them
to help, but they refused to help me. We ate from its meat and were afraid
that we would be cut off. I went to look for the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and made my horse gallop at times and walk at times.
In the middle of the night I met a man of the Banu Ghifar and said, "Where
did you leave the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?" He said,
"I left him at Ta'hun and he was going to have his midday rest at as-Suqya."
I said, "Messenger of Allah, your family send you greetings of peace and
the mercy of Allah. They were afraid that they might become cut off from
you, so wait for them." I said, "Messenger of Allah, I caught a wild ass
and I have some of it with me." He said to the people, "Eat," in spite of
the fact that they were in <I>ihram</I>.`"
<P>
[Ghayqa is a place between Makka and Madina. Suqya is a village.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: When people in <I>ihram</I> see game and laugh and someone not in
<I>ihram</I> catches on</B>
<P>
1726. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Qatada that his father said, "We
set out with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the
year of Hudaybiyya. His Companions went into <I>ihram</I>, but I did not.
We were informed that there was an enemy at Ghayqa and we went towards them.
My companions saw a wild ass and some of them started laughing among themselves.
I looked and saw it. I attacked it on horseback and I stabbed it and caught
it. I asked them for help but they refused to help me. We ate from it and
then I followed after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. We were afraid that we would be cut off. I made my horse gallop
at times and walk at times. In the middle of the night I met a man of the
Banu Ghifar and said, 'Where did you leave the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace?' He said, 'I left him at Ta'hun and he was going to
have his midday rest at as-Suqya.' I followed the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, until I caught up with him and said,
'Messenger of Allah, your Companions send you greetings of peace and the
mercy of Allah. They are afraid that the enemy might cut them off from you,
so wait for them.' He did that. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, We hunted a
wild ass and I have some of it with me.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said to his Companions, 'Eat,' in spite of
the fact that they were in <I>ihram</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: The <I>muhrim</I> should not help someone not in <I>ihram</I> to kill
game</B>
<P>
1727. It is related that Abu Qatada was heard to say, "We were with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at al-Qaha, which is three stages
from Madina."
<P>
It is related that Abu Qatada said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, at al-Qaha and some of us were in <I>ihram</I>
and some of us were not. I saw my companions watching something, so I looked
and there was a wild ass - i.e. he dropped his whip - and they said, 'We
will not help you at all. We are in <I>ihram</I>.' So I caught on and took
the whip and then came upon the ass from behind a hillock, slaughtered it
and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, 'Eat,' and others said,
'Do not eat.' I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
who was ahead of us and asked him and he said, 'Eat it as lawful.'"
<P>
'Amr said to us, "Go to Salih and ask him about this and other things. He
came to us here."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: A <I>muhrim</I> should not point out game in order for someone who
is not <I>muhrim</I> to hunt it</B>
<P>
1728. It is related from Abu Qatada that his father informed that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out on hajj and they
went out with him. He sent a group of them, which included Abu Qatada, saying,
"Take the sea-coast route until we meet." So they went by the sea-coast.
When they set out, they all went into <I>ihram</I> except for Abu Qatada
who did not. While they were travelling, they saw some wild asses and Abu
Qatada attacked the asses and killed a she-ass among them. They halted and
ate from its meat and said, "Should we be eating the meat of game when we
are in <I>ihram</I>?" So they carried what was left of the meat of the she-ass
and when they came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, they said, "Messenger of Allah, we were in <I>ihram</I>, but Abu
Qatada was not, and we saw some wild asses and Abu Qatada attacked the asses
and killed a she-ass among them. Then we halted and ate from its meat and
then we said, 'Should we be eating the meat of game when we are in
<I>ihram</I>?' So we have brought what is left of its meat." He said, "Did
any of you order him to attack it or point it out to him?" They said, "No."
He said, "Then eat what is left of its meat."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: When someone gives a <I>muhrim</I> a live wild ass, he should not
accept it</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#84">1729</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas
that as-Sa'b ibn Jaththama al-Laythi gave the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, a wild ass while he was at al-Abwa' or Waddan
and he returned it to him. When he saw the expression on his face, he said,
"We are only returning it to you because we are in <I>ihram</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Animals which a <I>muhrim</I> can kill</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#89">1730</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There
is nothing wrong in the <I>muhrim</I> killing five kinds of animals."
<P>
It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said it.
<P>
It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "One of the wives of the Prophet related
to me that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'A
<I>muhrim</I> can kill...'"
<P>
1731. It is related that Hafsa said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is nothing wrong in a
<I>muhrim</I> killing five kinds of animals: crows, kites, mice, scorpions
and a rabid dogs."
<P>
1732. It is related from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Five types of animals are all vicious and
can be killed in the Haram: crows, kites, scorpions, mice and a rabid dogs."
<P>
1733. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "While we were with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in a cave at Mina, <I>Surat
al-Mursalat</I> (77) was suddenly revealed to him and he recited it and I
learned it directly from his mouth. His mouth was still moist with it when
a snake attacked us and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Kill it,' We chased after it but it escaped. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'It was protected from your evil as
you were protected from its evil.'"
<P>
1734. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said that the gecko was
"'A small vicious creature,' but I did not hear him command that it be killed."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Not cutting down the trees of the Haram</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Its thorny bushes should not be cut."
<P>
1735. It is related that Abu Shurayh al-'Adawi said to 'Amr ibn Sa'id when
he was sending his troops to Makka, "O Amir! Let me tell you something the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said on the
day after the Conquest of Makka which I heard with my own ears and grasped
with my heart and saw him uttering with my own eyes. He praised and glorified
Allah and then said, 'Makka was made a sanctuary by Allah and not by people.
So it is not lawful for anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day to
shed blood in it nor to cut down any tree in it. If anyone allows it because
the Messenger of Allah fought in it, then say that Allah gave His Messenger
permission and he did not give you permission. He was only given permission
in it for a single hour of one day, and now its inviolability has reverted
to what it was previously. Let the one who is present convey to the one who
absent.'" Abu Shurayh was asked, "What did 'Amr say?" He said that 'Amr said,
"I know better than you, Abu Shurayh. It does not give refuge to anyone who
rebels or to anyone who sheds blood or steals."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: The game of the Haram should not be chased</B>
<P>
1736. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah made Makka a sanctuary. It was
not lawful to anyone before me and will not be lawful for anyone after me.
It was only lawful for me for one hour of one day. Its plants are not to
be pulled up nor its trees cut down nor its game chased away nor any fallen
things picked up in it except by someone who announces it". Al-'Abbas said,
"Apart from the <I>idhkhir</I> herb for our goldsmiths and graves!" The Prophet
said, "Apart from the <I>idhkhir</I> herb." 'Ikrima said, 'Do you know what
'chasing away its game' means?' It means driving it from its shade to take
its place."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: Fighting is not lawful in Makka</B>
<P>
Abu Shurayh said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Blood may not be shed in it."
<P>
1737. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "On the day of the Conquest of
Makka, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'There is no more <I>hijra</I>, but there is <I>jihad</I> and intention.
When you are called to it then go. Allah made this city inviolable on the
day when he created the heavens and the earth and it will be inviolable by
Allah's sanctity until the Day of Rising. Fighting was not lawful in it for
anyone before me and it was only lawful for me for one hour of one day. It
is inviolable by Allah's sanctity until the Day of Rising. Its thorns should
not be cut, its game should not be chased and something dropped should not
be picked up except by someone who announces it and.its plants are not to
be pulled up.'Al-'Abbas said, 'Messenger of Allah, apart from the
<I>idhkhir</I> herb for our goldsmiths and houses!' He said, 'Apart from
the <I>idhkhir</I> herb.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: Cupping in the case of a <I>muhrim</I></B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar cauterised his son while he was in <I>ihram</I>. A <I>muhrim</I>
can be treated with something which contains scent.
<P>
1738. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was cupped while he was in <I>ihram</I>."
Then I heard him say it is related from Tawus from Ibn 'Abbas. I said, "Perhaps
he heard it from both of them."
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#75">1739</A>. It is related that Ibn Buhayna said, "The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was cupped from the middle
of his head while he was in <I>ihram</I> at Lahya Jamal."
<P>
[A place between Makka and Madina, closer to Madina]
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: The marriage of a <I>muhrim</I></B>
<P>
1740. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, married Maymuna while he was in <I>ihram</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: What scent is forbidden for a male or female <I>muhrim</I></B>
<P>
'A'isha said, "A woman in <I>ihram</I> should not wear clothes with wars
or saffron on them."
<P>
1741. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "A man stood up and said, 'Messenger
of Allah, what clothes do you command us to wear in <I>ihram</I>?' The Prophe,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, replied, "You should not wear a
shirt, trousers, a turban or a burnous. However, someone who does not have
sandals can wear leather socks but he should cut them short so that they
start under the ankle. He should not wear anything stained with wars or saffron.
The woman in <I>ihram</I> should not wear a veil on her face nor gloves."
<P>
Musa ibn 'Uqba, Isma'il ibn Ibrahim ibn 'Uqba, Juwayriyya and Ibn Ishaq
corroborated the veil and the gloves. 'Ubaydullah said, "nor wars." He used
to say, "A woman in <I>ihram</I> should not veil her face nor wear gloves."
Malik said from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar, "A woman in <I>ihram</I> should not
veil her face." Layth ibn Abi Sulaym corroborated it.
<P>
1742. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A man in <I>ihram</I> was crushed
by his she-camel and killed. He was brought to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, who said, 'Wash him and shroud him,
but do not cover his head nor put scent on him. He will be raised saying
the <I>talbiya</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: A <I>muhrim</I> doing <I>ghusl</I></B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "A <I>muhrim</I> can enter a bath-house." Ibn 'Umar and
'A'isha did not see any harm in scratching.
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#4">1743</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Hunayn,
"'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama disagreed at al-Abwa'.
'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas said, 'A <I>muhrim</I> can wash his head,' and al-Miswar
said, 'A <I>muhrim</I> should not wash his head.' 'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas
sent me to Ayyub al-Ansari and I found him doing <I>ghusl</I> between two
posts, screened by a cloth. I greeted him and he said, 'Who is it?' I said,
'It is 'Abdullah ibn Hunayn. 'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas sent me to you to ask
you how the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
washed his head when he was in <I>ihram</I>.' Abu Ayyub put his hand on the
cloth and lowered it until his head appeared to me. Then he told someone
to pour water on him, 'Pour,' and he poured water on his head and then he
rubbed his head with his hands, and brought them forward and then back again.
He said, 'This is how I saw him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
do it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: A <I>muhrim</I> wearing leather socks if he cannot find any
sandals</B>
<P>
1744. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, giving a <I>khutba</I> at 'Arafa saying, 'If
a <I>muhrim</I> cannot find any sandals, he should wear leather socks. If
he cannot find a waist-wrapper he should wear trousers.'"
<P>
1745. It is related from 'Abdullah, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was asked, 'What clothes should a <I>muhrim</I>
wear?' He said, 'He should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers or a burnous
nor any garment touched by saffron or wars. However, someone who does not
have any sandals can wear leather socks but he should cut them short so that
they start under the ankle.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: If he cannot find a waist-wrapper, he can wear trousers</B>
<P>
1746. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, giving a <I>khutba</I> at 'Arafa, 'If a
<I>muhrim</I> cannot find a waist-wrapper he should wear trousers. If he
cannot find any sandals, he should wear leather socks.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: A <I>muhrim</I> carrying arms</B>
<P>
'Ikrima said, "When an enemy is feared, weapons should be worn and
<I>fidya</I> paid." No one corroborates him regarding the [the obligation
of paying] <I>fidya</I>.
<P>
1747. It is related from al-Bara', "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, performed <I>'umra</I> in Dhu'l-Qa'da and the people of
Makka refused to allow him to enter Makka until he had made an agreement
with them only to bring sheathed arms into Makka."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: Entering the Haram and Makka not in <I>ihram</I></B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar entered and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
commanded those who intended hajj or <I>'umra </I>to go into <I>ihram</I>
but did not mention woodcutters or other people.
<P>
1748. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, appointed Dhu'l-Hulayfa as the <I>miqat</I> for the
people of Madina, Qarn al-Manazil for the people of Najd, and Yalamlam for
the people of Yemen. They are for them and for anyone coming from elsewhere
who wants to go on hajj or <I>'umra</I>. For anyone coming from closer than
that, it is from wherever he starts, even the people of Makka from Makka."
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#256">1749</A>. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered Makka
in the year of the Conquest with a helmet on his head. When he removed it,
a man came and said, 'Ibn Khatal is holding onto the cover of the Ka'ba.'
He said, 'Kill him.'"
<P>
[The man was Abu Bazra al-Aslami. 'Abdullah ibn Khatal had become Muslim.
When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent him to collect
<I>zakat</I> along with another man from the Ansar, Ibn Khatal had murdered
the Ansari on the road and became an apostate. He had two slavegirls who
used to sing satirical poems about the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.]

and this paper from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace:

actions, on him is the curse of Allah, the angels and all people. Neither
repentance nor ransom will be accepted from him.' He said, 'The <I>dhimma</I>
[covenant] of the Muslims is the same. Whoever breaks a Muslim's covenant,

be two herdsmen from Muzayna making for Madina, shouting to their sheep.

Dajjal and part of what he told us was, 'The Dajjal will come and will be
forbidden to enter the entrances of Madina. He will alight at one of the
salt marshes at Madina. On that day a man, who is the best of people - or
one of the best of people - will come out to him and say, "I testify that
you are the Dajjal about whom the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, related a <I>hadith</I> to us." The Dajjal will say,
"If I kill this man and then bring him to life will you still doubt my business?"
He will say, "No." He will kill him and then bring him life. When he brings
him to life, he will say, "By Allah, now I am even more certain." The Dajjal
