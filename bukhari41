The Book of Adab* (Good Manners)</BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><P ALIGN=Left>[*Adab: To discipline the self to have good character and the excellent wordsand actions which the Shari'a recommends and logic reinforces. It entailsemploying good words and actions. <I>Adab</I> is derived from <I>ma'duba</I>(banquet), which is a meal which is preferred and then to which people areinvited. It is called that adab because it is that to which everyone is invited.]<P ALIGN=Left><P><B>I. Dutifulness (<I>birr</I>) and maintaining ties of kinship</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, "<I>We have instructed man to honour hisparents..."</I> (29:8)<P>5625. Al-Walid ibn 'Ayzar reported that he heard Abu 'Amr ash-Shaybani say,"The owner of this house (and he indicated the house of 'Abdullah) reportedto me saying, 'I asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,what action was most loved by Allah and he answered, "The prayer at its propertime."' 'Abdullah asked, "Then what?" He said, "Then devotion to parents."He said, "Then what?" He said, "Jihad in the way of Allah."<P>He said, "He related them to me and if I had asked for more, he would havetold me more."<P><P><B>II. Who is the person most entitled to the best company?</B><P>5626. Abu Zur'a related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man* came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and asked, 'Messengerof Allah, what person is the most entitled to the best of my company?' Heanswered, 'Your mother.' He asked, 'Then whom?' He said, 'Your mother.' Heasked, 'Then whom?' He said, 'Your mother. He asked, 'Then whom?' He said,'Your father.'"<P>Ibn Shubruma and Yahya ibn Ayyub said that Abu Zur'a related the like ofit.<P>[*The man was Mu'awiya ibn Hayda, the grandfather of Bahz ibn Hakim.]<P><P><B>III. One should only go on jihad with the permission of one's parents</B><P>5627. Abu'l-'Abbas related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "A man asked theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Can I go on jihad?' TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'Are your parentsalive?' He answered, 'Yes.' He said, 'Then strive in caring for them.'"<P><P><B>IV. A man should not abuse his parents</B><P>5628. Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said thatthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Oneof the major wrong actions is for a man to abuse his parents." It was said,"O Messenger of Allah, how can a man curse his parents?" He said, "He maycurse another man's father who in turn curses his father, and curse his motherand he in turn curses his mother."<P><P><B>V. The acceptance of the supplication of someone who is dutiful to hisparents</B><P>5629. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "While three people were travelling,they were caught by the rain and took shelter in a cave in a mountain. Alarge boulder fell from the mountain and blocked the entrance to the caveand blocked their way out. They said to one another, 'Think of righteousactions you have done for the sake of Allah and invoke Allah by them andperhaps He will remove it.<P>"One of them said, "O Allah, I had very old parents and young children. Iused to work as a shepherd for the, When I returned to them in the eveningand had milked the animals, I began with my parents and let them drink beforemy children. One day I went a long way seeking grazing and did not come backuntil late evening and they had gone to sleep. I milked as I normally didand brought the milk and stood at their heads, as I disliked to wake themup and I disliked to give the milk to the children before them. while thechildren were crying out of hunger at my feet. I remained like and they remainedas they were until dawn. If you know that I did that out of the desire forYour Face, then make an opening for us so that we can see the sky.' Allahgave them an opening through which they could see the sky.<P>"The second said, 'I had a cousin whom I loved with the greatest love whichmen can love women. I tried to seduce her and she refused unless I gave hera hundred dinars. I worked hard until I had collected a hundred dinars andI took it to her. When I was sitting between her legs, she said, "O slaveof Allah, fear Allah and not break the seal without having the right to doso." I got up and left her. O Allah, if You know that I did that out of thedesire for Your face, then make an opening for us!' It opened for them abit.<P>"The last said, 'O Allah, I employed a worker for a <I>faraq</I> of rice.When he finished his work, he said, "Give me my due." I offered him his due,but he left it and turned from him. I continued to sow it until I amassedfrom it some cattle and a cowherd. Then he came to me and said, "Fear Allahand do not wrong me. Give me my due." I said, "Go to those cattle and theircowherd." He said, "Fear Allah and do not make fun of me." I answered, "Iam not making fun of you." Take those cattle and their cowherd." So he tookthem and left with them. If You know that I did that out of the desire forYour Face, release us from the rest of it!' Allah released them.'"<P><P><B>VI. Lack of dutifulness to parents is a major wrong action</B><P>'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said that it is from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace.<P>5630. Warrad related from Al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah has forbidden you: disobedienceto your mothers, refusing to fulfil your obligations and taking what is notlawfully yours, and burying your daughters alive. He dislikes for you toindulge in useless talk, asking too much and wasting wealth."<P>5631. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr related from his father, Abu Bakra, thatthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "ShallI inform you of the greatest of wrong actions?" They said, "Please do, Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!' He said, "Associatingwith Allah, disobedience to parents." He had been reclining and now sat upand said, 'And false witness.' He continued to repeat it until we said, 'Iwish he would be quiet.'"<P>5632. 'Ubaydullah ibn Abi Bakr said that he heard Anas ibn Malik say, "TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned thegreatest wrong actions (or was asked about the greatest wrong actions) andhe said, 'Associating with Allah, murder, and disobedience to parents.' Hesaid, 'Shall I tell you of the greatest of wrong actions?' He went on, 'Thefalse statement (or 'false witness).'" Shu'ba said, "I think that it is mostlikely that he said, "False witness."<P><P><B>VII. Maintaining good ties with a parent who is an idolater</B><P>5633. 'Urwa related that Asma' bint Abi Bakr said, "My mother came to mewhile the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wasalive, hoping for my favour. I asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, 'Shall I give to my mother?' He said, 'Yes. '" Ibn'Uyayna said, "Then Prophet Almighty revealed about her,<I> 'Allah does notforbid you from being good to those who have not fought you in the deen...'</I>(60:8)"<P><P><B>VIII. A woman who has a husband maintaining good ties with her mother</B><P>5634. 'Urwa related that Asma' said, "My mother came with her father whileshe was an idolater during the truce from the treaty which the Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, had made with Quraysh. I asked the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for a decision, saying, 'My motherhas arrived hoping for my favour.' He answered, 'Yes, give to your mother.'"<P>5635. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas reported that Abu Sufyan had told him that Heracliussent for him and asked, "What does he, meaning the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, command you?" He answered, "He commanded us to pray,give <I>sadaqa</I>, be chaste and maintain ties of kinship.'"<P><P><B>IX. Maintaining good ties with a brother who is an idolater</B><P>5636. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar said, "I heard Ibn 'Umar say, ''Umar saw a silkrobe being sold and said, "Messenger of Allah, buy this and wear it on Fridayand when delegations come to you." He said, "This is worn by the one whohas no share [in the Next World.]" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was brought some robes like that and he sent a robe to 'Umar whosaid, "How can I wear it when you said what you said about it?" He said,"I did not give it to you so that you could wear it, but for you to sellor to give to someone else to where." 'Umar sent it to a brother of his amongthe people of Makka before he had become Muslim.'"<P><P><B>X. The virtue of maintaining ties of kinship</B><P>5637. Musa ibn Talha was heard to relate that Abu Ayyub said, "It was said,'Messenger of Allah, tell me an action which will ensure my entrance intothe Garden'"<P>Musa ibn Talha related that Abu Ayyub al-Ansari related that a man said,"Tell me an action which will ensure my entrance into the Garden." The peoplesaid, "What does he want? What is wrong with him?" The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "What he wants is to knowsomething." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "WorshipAllah and do not associate anything else with him. Establish the prayer andpay the zakat and maintain ties of kinship. Leave it!" He said, "It seemsthat the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was riding hiscamel."<P><P><B>XI. The wrong action of someone who dissociates himself from relatives</B><P>5638. Muhammad ibn Jubayr ibn Mut'im said that Jubayr ibn Mut'im told himthat he heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say,"Someone who dissociates himself from relatives will not enter the Garden."<P><P><B>XII. The one who was given ample wealth because of maintaining ties ofkinship</B><P>5639. Sa'id ibn Abi Sa'id related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Anyone who desiresthe expansion of his provision or to have the rest of his life prolonged,should maintain ties of kinship.'"<P>5640. Ibn Shihab related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who wants his provisionto be expanded or to have the rest of his life prolonged, should maintainties of kinship."<P><P><B>XIII. If someone maintains good relations with his kin, Allah will keepgood relations with him</B><P>5641. Sa'id ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty created creation andwhen he finished creating, kinship stood up and said, 'This is the placeof him who seeks refuge with You from being cut off.' He said, 'Yes. Wouldyou be pleased if I joined anyone who joined you and cut off anyone who cutyou off?' It said, 'Yes, my Lord.' He said, 'Then you have that.' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If you wish, thenrecite,<I> "Is it not likely that, if you did turn away, you would causecorruption in the earth and sever your ties of kinship?"</I>' (47:22)"<P>5642. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Kinship is derived from <I>ar-Rahman</I>.Allah said, 'I will join whoever joins you and I will cut off whoever cutsyou off.'"<P>5643. 'Urwa related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said. "Kinship is derived from ar-Rahman. I will join whoeverjoins you and I will cut off whoever cuts you off."<P><P><B>XIV. Kinship is is reinforced by refreshing it</B><P>5644. Qays ibn Abi Hazim related that 'Amr ibn al-'As said, "I heard theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say aloud andnot secretly, 'The family of Abu [Talib] are not my supporters. ('Amr saidthat there was a gap after Abu in the book of Muhammad ibn Ja'far.) My supportersare Allah and the righteous believers."<P>Qays added that 'Amr ibn al-'As said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, say, 'But they have kinship which is reinforcedby refreshing it,'" meaning I maintain good relations with them.<P><P><B>XV. The one who maintains good ties is not the one who recompenses good</B><P>5645. Mujahid related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said. "The one who maintains good tiesis not the one who recompenses good. The one who maintains good ties is theone who maintains ties when his kin cut him off."<P>(Sufyan said that al-A'mash does not have it <I>marfu'</I>, going back tothe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, but both al-Hasan ibn'Amr and Fitr say it is <I>marfu'</I>.)<P><P><B>XVI. The one who maintained good ties with relatives while an idolaterand then became Muslim</B><P>5646. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr reported that Hakim ibn Hizam said, "Messengerof Allah, what do you say about the things such as maintaining kinship, freeingslaves and <I>sadaqa</I> by which I used to worship in the time of<I>Jahiliyya</I>. Will I have any reward for them?" Hakim said that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "You became Muslimwith all the good you did in the past."<P>Abu'l-Yaman said, "By which I used to worship as did Ma'mar, Salih and Ibnal-Musafir. Ibn Ishaq said that <I>tahannuth</I> is to purify oneself. Hishamcorroborated it from his father.<P><P><B>XVII. The one who let a small girl of another person play with him, orkissed her or joked with her</B><P>5647. Sa'id related that Umm Khalid bint Khalid ibn Sa'id said, "I came tothe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with myfather wearing a yellow long shirt. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said,<I> 'Sanah! Sanah!'</I> ('Abdullah said thatit means 'beautiful' in Abyssinian.) I began to play with the seal of prophethoodand my father scolded me. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'Let her be.' Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'May it wear out be mended and thenwear out be mended and then wear out and be mended.'" 'Abdullah said, "Itlasted until people commented on it," i.e. because of the length of timethey lasted.<P><P><B>XVIII. Showing mercy to children, kissing them and embracing them</B><P>Thabit said from Anas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,took Ibrahim and kissed him and smelled him."<P>5648. Ibn Abi Ya'qub related that Ibn Abi Nu'm said, "I was present withIbn 'Umar when a man asked him about the blood of mosquitoes. He asked, 'Whereare you from?' 'One of the people of Iraq,' he replied. He said, 'Look atthis! He asks me about the blood of mosquitoes when they murdered the sonof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace! I heard the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'They are my sweet basil inthis world!'"<P>5649. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr reported that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A woman came with her twodaughters to beg and I had nothing but a date which I gave to her. She dividedit between her two daughters. Then she got up and left. The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, came in to us and I told him about thisand he said, 'If someone cares for* these daughters in any way and treatsthem well, they will be a shield from the Fire for him.'"<P>[*In one variant, "Anyone who is tested by..."<P>5650. 'Amr ibn Sulaym related that Abu Qatada said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, came out to us with Umama bint Abi'l-'As onhis shoulder. He prayed, and when he bowed in <I>ruku'</I>, he put her down,and when he came out, he picked her up."<P>5651. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, kissed al-Hasan ibn 'Ali while al-Aqra'ibn Habis at-Tamimi was sitting with him. Al-Aqra' said, 'I have ten childrenand I have never kissed any of them.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, looked at him and then said, 'The one who does notshow mercy will not be shown mercy.'"<P>5652. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "A bedouin came to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Do you kiss children? Wedo not kiss them.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'There is nothing I can do if Allah has removed mercy from your hearts'"<P>5653. Aslam related from 'Umar ibn al-Khattab: "Some captives were broughtto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, among whom was awoman who made the milk flow from her breasts to feed. When she found a childamong the captives, she took it and brought it to her chest and suckled it.The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to us, 'Can youimagine this woman casting her child into the Fire?' We said, 'No.' He said,'No. She has the power not to cast it.' Then he said, 'Allah is more mercifulto His slaves than this woman is to her child.'"<P><P><B>XIX. Allah has divided mercy into a hundred parts</B><P>5654. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab reported that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Allahdivided mercy into a hundred parts. He kept back ninety-nine parts with Himselfand left one part on the earth. It is from this part that creatures showmercy to one another so that an animal lifts its hoof from its young fearingto hurt them.'"<P><P><B>XX. Killing one's children out of fear that they will eat with him</B><P>5655. 'Amr ibn Shurahbil related that 'Abdullah said, "I said, 'Messengerof Allah, which wrong action is worst?' He said, ''That you set up a rivalwith Allah when He created you.' I said, 'Then what?' He said, 'That youkill your child fearing that he will eat with you.' I said, 'Then what?'He said, 'That you fornicate with your neighbour's wife.' Allah sent downconfirmation of the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, in <I>'Those who do not call on any other god together with Allah.'</I>(25:68)"<P><P><B>XXI. Putting a child in one's lap</B><P>5656. 'Urwa related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, put a child in his lap to rub its gums [with a date] andthe child urinated on him. He called for water and poured it over the spot."<P><P><B>XXII. Putting a child on one's thigh</B><P>5657. Abu 'Uthman reported from Usama ibn Zayd, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to take me and sit me on histhigh and he would sit al-Hasan on his other thigh and then embrace us andthen say, 'O Allah, show mercy to them! I show mercy to them!'"<P>Sulayman related it from Abu 'Uthman reported. At-Taymi said, "Somethingabout it occurred to my heart and I said, 'I related it as such-and-suchwhen I did not hear it from Abu 'Uthman.' I looked found that I had it writtendown in what I had heard."<P><P><B>XXIII. Proper faithfulness are part of faith</B><P>5658. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "I was not jealous about any womanas I was jealous about Khadija, although she died three years before he marriedme, when I heard him mention her. His Lord commanded him to give her thegood news of a house of pearls in the Garden. If he sacrificed a sheep, hewould give some of it to her friends."<P><P><B>XXIV. The excellence of someone who provides for an orphan</B><P>5659. Abu Hazim related that he heard Sahl ibn Sa'd report that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I and those who care fororphans will be in the Garden like this," and he pointed with his forefingerand middle finger.<P><P><B>XXV. The one who cares for a widow</B><P>5660. Malik reported that Safwan ibn Sulaym said in a <I>marfu' hadith</I>going back to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Someonewho strives on behalf of widows and the poor is like someone who fights inthe way of Allah or like someone who continually stands at night in prayerand like someone who continually fasts."<P>The like of it has come from another isnad from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>XXVI. The one who cares for a poor person</B><P>5661. Abu'l-Ghayth related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Someone who strives on behalfof widows and the poor is like someone who fights in the way of Allah."Al-Qa'nabi said, "I think that he also said, 'or like someone who continuallyfasts in the day and continually stands in prayer at night.'"<P><P><B>XXVII. Showing mercy to people and to animals</B><P>5662. Abu Qilaba related that Abu Sulayman ibn Malik ibn al-Huwayrith said,"We came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as youngmen of about the same age and stayed twenty nights with him. Then he realisedthat we were longing for our families and he asked us about those we hadleft behind us and we informed him. He was kind and merciful. He said, 'Returnto your families and teach them and instruct them. Pray as you have seenme pray. When it is time for the prayer, one of you should give the<I>adhan</I> and the oldest of you should lead you in the prayer.'"<P>5663. Abu Salih as-Samman related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "While a man was talkingon a road, he became very thirsty. He found a well and went down into it.He drank and then came out and there was a dog panting and eating the mudout of thirst. The man said, 'This dog has become as thirsty as I was. Sohe went down into the well and filled his leather sock with water and heldit in his mouth and let the dog drink. Allah thanked him for that and forgavehim.' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, do we have a reward for animals?' Hesaid, 'There is a reward for every living creature.'"<P>5664. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up for the prayerand we stood up with him. While he was praying, a bedouin said, 'O Allah,show mercy to me and Muhammad and do not show mercy on anyone else with us!'When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said the<I>taslim</I>, he said to the bedouin, 'You have confined something whichis vast,' meaning the mercy of Allah."<P>[The bedouin was Dhu'l-Khuwaysara al-Yamani. It is also said that he wasthe bedouin who had ignorantly urinated in the mosque.]<P>5665. 'Amir was heard to say that he heard an-Nu'man ibn Bashir say, "TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'You seethe believers in their mutual mercy, love and affection like a single body.When one limb of it complains, the rest of the body shares with it bysleeplessness and fever.'"<P>5666. Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "There is no Muslim who plants something andthen a human being or animal eat from it but that it is counted as<I>sadaqa</I> for him."<P>5667. Zayd ibn Wahb related that he heard from Jarir ibn 'Abdullah that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The one who doesnot show mercy will not be shown mercy."<P><P><B>XXVIII. The command to be good to one's neighbour</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Worship Allah and do not attribute partnersto Him. Be good to your parents and relatives and to orphans and the verypoor, and to neighbours who are related to you and neighbours who are notrelated to you...</I>" (4:36)<P>5668. 'Amra $ related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Jibril continued to advise me to be good to myneighbour until I thought that he would have me make him my heir."<P>5669. The father of 'Umar ibn Muhammad related from his father that Ibn 'Umarsaid that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Jibril continued to advise me to be good to my neighbour until I thoughtthat he would have me make him my heir."<P><P><B>XXIX. The wrong action of someone whose neighbour does not feel safe fromhis mischief</B><P><I>"Yubiqhunna" </I>(42:34) means "He can destroy them." <I>Mawbiq</I> (18:52)is a place of destruction.<P>5670. Sa'id related from Abu Shurayh that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "By Allah, he does not believe! By Allah, he doesnot believe! By Allah, he does not believe!" It was asked. "Who is that,Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Someone whose neighbour is not safe from hismischief."<P>Shababa and Asad ibn Musa corroborated it.<P>Another isnad from al-Maqburi from Abu Hurayra.<P><P><B>XXX. A woman neighbour should not disdain a gift given by another womanneighbour</B><P>5671. Sa'id al-Maqburi reported from his father that Abu Hurayra said, "TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, 'Women ofthe Muslims! A woman neighbour should not disdain a gift given by anotherwoman neighbour!'"<P><P><B>XXXI. "The one who believes in Allah and the Last Day should not harmhis neighbour."</B><P>5672. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The one who believes in Allahand the Last Day should not harm his neighbour. The one who believes in Allahand the Last Day should be generous to his guest. The one who believes inAllah and the Last Day should say what is good or be silent."<P>5673. Sa'id al-Maqburi related that Abu Shurayh al-'Adawi said, "My earsheard and my eyes saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,when he spoke and said, 'Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day shouldbe generous to his neighbour. Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Dayshould honour his guest as his due.' Someone said, 'What is his due, Messengerof Allah?' He answered, 'A day and a night. Hospitality is for three days.Whatever is beyond that is <I>sadaqa</I> for him. Anyone who believes inAllah and the Last Day should speak well or be silent.'"<P><P><B>XXXII. The rights of the closer neighbou</B>r<P>5674. Talha related that 'A'isha said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah. I havetwo neighbours. To which of them should I give?' He said, 'To the one whosedoor is nearer to you.'"<P><P><B>XXXIII. Every right thing is <I>sadaqa</I></B><P>5675. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Every right thingis <I>sadaqa</I>."<P>5676. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Every Muslim must give <I>sadaqa</I>?' They asked,"And if he does not have anything?' He said, "Then he should work with hishands and help himself and give sadaqa." They said, "And if he cannot workor does not work?"

One of the Companions saw him wearing it and said, 'Messengerof Allah, how excellent this is! Let me have it to wear.' 'Yes,' he answered.When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up, then theman's companions censured him. They said, 'You have not acted well.

"Yes," they answered. She said, "I make an vowto Allah that I will never again speak to Ibn az-Zubayr!" When the shunningwent on for along time, Ibn az-Zubayr asked people to intercede with her.She said, "No, by Allah, I will not accept intercession for him and I willnot break my vow." When that lasted a long time for Ibn az-Zubayr, he spoketo al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Aswad ibn 'Abdu Yaghuth.They were from the Banu Zahra. He said to them, "I ask you by Allah to bringme to 'A'isha. It is not lawful for her to vow to cut me off.' Al-Miswarand 'Abdu'r-Rahman brought him wrapped in their cloaks and they asked permissionto go in and visit 'A'isha. They said, "Peace be upon you and the mercy ofAllah and His blessing. May we enter?" 'A'isha said, "Enter." "All of us?"they asked. "Yes," she answered, "all of you may enter," not knowing thatIbn az-Zubayr was with him. When they entered, Ibn az-Zubayr entered behindthe screen. He embraced? 'A'isha and began to entreat her and weep. AL-Miswarand 'Abdu'r-Rahman began to entreat her to speak to him and accept him. Theysaid, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade whatyou know about shunning. It is: 'It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun hisbrother for more than three days.'" When they increased their reminding 'A'ishaand constricting? her, she began to remind them, weeping, sayings, "I madea vow! Vows are strong." They kept at her until she spoke to Ibn az-Zubayr.To expiate her vow she set forty slaves free. After that she used to rememberher vow and would weep until her veil was wet from her tears.<P>5726. In Shihab related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not hate one another,envy one another, or turn your backs on one another. Be slaves of Allah andbrothers. It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more thanthree days."<P>5727. 'Ata' ibn Yazid al-Laythi related from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "It isnot lawful for a man to shun his brother for more than three days so thatwhen they meet, this one turns away and that one turns away, The best ofthem is the one who initiates the greeting."<P><P><B>LXIII. What is permitting of shunning when someone disobeys Allah</B><P>When Ka'b had stayed behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, he said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadethe Muslims to speak to us." He mentioned fifty nights.<P>5728. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'I know when you are angry and whenyou are pleased.' 'How do you recognise that, Messenger of Allah?' He said,'When you are pleased, you say, "Yes, by the Lord of Muhammad." When youare angry, you say, "No, by the Lord of Ibrahim."' I said, 'Yes, I only avoidyour name.'"<P><P><B>LXIV. May a person visit his friend every day or in the morning andevening</B><P>5729. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I have no recollection ofmy parents doing anything but following the deen. No day would pass withoutthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visitingus at either end of it, both morning and evening. While we were sitting inthe house of Abu Bakr at noon, someone said, 'This is the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, coming at a time in which he doesnor usually come to us.' Abu Bakr said, 'He has only come at this hour becausesomething has happened.' He said, 'I have been given permission to leave.'"<P><P><B>LXV. Visiting. Those who visited people and ate with them.</B><P>Salman visited Abu'd-Darda' while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was alive and ate with him.<P>5730. Anas ibn Sirin related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visited the people of one of thehouses of the Ansar. He ate some food with them and when he wanted to leave.he ordered that a mat be sprinkled in a place in the house and he prayedthere and made supplication for him.<P><P><B>LXVI. The one who dressed up for delegations</B><P>5731. Yahya ibn Abi Ishaq said, "Salim ibn 'Abdullah said to me. 'What is<I>istabraq</I>?' I answered, 'Heavy silk brocade as well as the coarse sortof it.' He said, 'I heard 'Abdullah say that 'Umar saw a man wearing a robemade of <I>istabraq</I> and he brought it to the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah,, buy this and wearit for delegations of people when they come to you!' He said, 'Silk is wornby one who will have no share (in the Next World).' Some time passed andthen the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent a robe tohim. He brought it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and said, 'You sent this to me when you said what you said about it.' Hesaid, 'I sent it to you so that you could get money for it.'"<P>Ibn 'Umar used to dislike silk markings on garment based on this<I>hadith</I>.<P><P><B>LXVII. Establishing brotherhood and alliances</B><P>Abu Juhayfa said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,established brotherhood between Salman and Abu'd-Darda'."<P>'A'isha ibn 'Awf said, "When we came to Madina, the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, established brotherhood between me and Sa'd ibnar-Rabi'."<P>5732. Humayd reported that Anas said, "When 'Abdu'r-Rahman came to us, theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,established brotherhoodbetween him and Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'Give a wedding feast, even with a sheep.'"<P>5733. 'Asim related: "I said to Anas ibn Malik. 'Has it reached you thatthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Thereis no treaty in Islam"?' Anas said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, established brotherhood between Quraysh and the Ansar inmy house.'"<P><P><B>LXVIII. Smiling and laughing</B><P>Fatima, peace be upon her, said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, confided something to me and I laughed."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "Allah makes laugh and makes weep."<P>5734. 'Urwa related from 'A'isha that Rifa'a al-Qurazi divorced his wifewith a final divorce. After him 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn az-Zubayr married her.She went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,"Messenger of Allah, I was married to Rifa'a and he divorced me with thefinal third divorce and after him I married 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn az-Zubayr.By Prophet, Messenger of Allah, he only has something like this fringe,"and she took hold of the fringe of her garment. 'Urwa said, "Abu Bakr wassitting with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whileIbn Sa'id ibn al-'As was sitting at the for of the room, waiting for permissionto enter. Khalid began to call Abu Bakr, 'Abu Bakr! Will you not stop herfrom saying this openly in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, did nothing more than smile. Then he said, 'Perhapsyou wish to return to Rifa'a? No, not until you taste his sweetness and hetastes yours.'"<P>5735. Muhammad ibn Sa'd related from his father, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab askedpermission to enter where the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, was while there were some women of Quraysh with him whospeaking to him and asking him for more, raising their voices above his voice.When 'Umar asked for permission to enter, they rushed to screen themselves.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave himpermission and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, waslaughing. 'Umar said, 'May Allah make you laugh, Messenger of Allah. Maymy father and mother be your ransom!' He said, 'I am amazed at those womenwho were with me. When they heard your voice, they rushed to screen themselves.''Umar said, 'But you, Messenger of Allah, are more entitled to be feared.'Then he said, 'O enemies of your selves! Do you fear me and not fear theMessenger of Allah?' They answered, 'Yes, you are harsher and more severethan the Messenger of Allah.' The Messenger of Allah said, 'By the One inwhose hand my soul is, son of al-Khattab, whenever Shaytan finds you takinga path, he only takes a path other than your path.'"<P>5736. Abu'l-'Abbas related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "When the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was at Ta'if, he said,'Tomorrow we will return, Allah willing,' Some of the Companions of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'We will not gountil we conquer it.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Then fight tomorrow.' The next morning they fought them fiercely andsuffered many wounds. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'Tomorrow we will return, Allah willing.' They were silentand the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughed."<P>Al-Humaydi said that Sufyan reported all of the report.<P>5737. Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I amdestroyed. I had sexual intercourse with my wife in Ramadan.' He said, 'Freea slave.' He said, 'I do not have any.' He said, 'Then fast two consecutivemonths.' he said, 'I cannot.' He said, 'Then feed sixty poor people.' Hesaid, 'I do not have it.' Then a basket of dates was brought. (Ibrahim saidthat <I>'araq </I>is a basket.) The Prophet said, 'Where is the questioner?Give it away as <I>sadaqa</I>.' The man said, 'To one poorer than me, Messengerof Allah? By Allah, there is no family between the two <I>harras</I> whichis poorer than us.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,smiled until his molars showed and then said, 'Feed it to your family then.'"<P>5738. Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha related that Anas ibn Malik said,"I was walking with the Messenger of Allah who was wearing a Najrani cloakwith a thick border. A bedouin caught up to him and pulled his cloak violently.I looked at the side of the neck of the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and it had been marked by the border of the cloak due tothe violence of his tugging. Then he said, 'Muhammad, order for me some ofthe property of Allah which you have!' He turned to him and laughed and thenordered that he be given a gift.'"<P>5739. Qays related that Jarir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, did not screen himself from me from the time I became Muslim.Whenever he saw me, he smiled at me. I complained to him that I could notsit firm on horses and he struck me in the chest with his hand and said,'O Allah, make him firm! Make him a guiding guide!'"<P>5740. Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salama related from Umm Salama that UmmSulaym said, "Messenger of Allah, Prophet is not embarrassed by the truth.Does a woman have to perform a ghusl when she has a wet dream?" He answered,"Yes, she sees a liquid." Umm Salama laughed and said, "Does a woman havea wet dream?" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, answered,"How does the child resemble her?"<P>5741. Sulayman ibn Yasar related that 'A'isha said, "I never saw the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughing to the point where onecould see his palate. He only smiled."<P>5742. Qatada related that Anas said that a man came to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, on Friday when he was giving the <I>khutba</I>in Madina when there was a drought. He said, "Ask your Lord for rain." Helooked at heaven and we could not see a cloud in the sky. He prayed for rainand the clouds began to gather on top of one another. Then they had rainuntil the water courses of Madina began to flow with water. It continuedwithout stop until the next Friday. Then that man or another man stood upwhile the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was giving the<I>khutba</I> and said, 'We are drowned. Ask your Lord to make it stop forus." He laughed and then said, "O Allah, around us but not on us" two orthree times. The clouds began to disperse from Madina to the right and theleft and it rained around Madina while none of it fell on us. Allah showedthem the miracle of His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and answered his supplication."<P><P><B>LXIX. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"O who you believe! Fear Allah andbe with the truthful." </I>(9:119)</B><P><B>Lying which is forbidden</B><P>5743. Abu Wa'il related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Truthfulness leads to piety and piety leadsto the Garden. A man should be truthful until he is written down as truthfulwith Allah. Lying leads to deviance and deviance leads to the Fire. A manwill lie until he is written down as a liar with Allah."<P>5744. Malik ibn Abi 'Amir related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are three signsof a hypocrite: whenever he speaks, he lies; whenever he makes a promise,he breaks it; and whenever he is trusted, he betrays his trust."<P>5745. Abu Raja' related that Samura ibn Jundub said that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I dreamt that two men came tome and said, 'The person whose jaw you saw being split was a liar. He tolda lie and then it was carried from him in all directions. This will be doneto him until the Day of Rising."<P><P><B>LXX. Righteous guidance</B><P>5746. Shaqiq was heard to say that he heard Hudhayfa say, "The person whomost resembled the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, in appearance, manner and character was Ibn Umm 'Abd from when heleaves his house until he returns to it. We do not know what he does withhis family when he is alone."<P>5747. Tariq said that 'Abdullah said, "The best of speech is the Book ofAllah Almighty and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, may Allahbless him and grant him peace."<P><P><B>LXXI. Patience in the face of injury</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"The steadfast will be paid their wages infull without any reckoning." </I>(39:10)<P>5748. Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman as-Sulami related from Abu Musa that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "No one (or there is nothing)is more patient in the face of harm which he hears than Allah. They claimthat He has a child and yet He still gives them good health and providesfor them."<P>5749. Shaqiq said that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, made a distribution as he used to do in some of hisdistributions. One of the men of the Ansar said, 'By Allah, this is adistribution by which the Face of Allah is not intended.' I said, 'I willtell the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' So I went tohim while he was with some of his Companions and confined it to him. Thatwas hard for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and hisface changed colour and he became angry so that I wished that I had not toldhim. Then he said, 'Musa was tested by more than this and remained steadfast.'"<P><P><B>LXXII. The one who did not blame people to their faces</B><P>5750. Masruq related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace,did something and made an allowance for people to do.Some people refrained from it out of caution. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, heard about that and addressed the people. He praisedAllah and then said, 'What is wrong with some people who refrain from goingsomething I do out of prudence? By Allah, I know Allah better than they andhave a stronger fear of Him!'"<P>5751. 'Abdullah ibn Abi 'Utba, the client of Anas, related that Abu Sa'idal-Khudri said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wasmore modest than a virgin in her tent. When he saw something he disliked,we could see it in his face."<P><P><B>LXXIII. If someone calls his brother an unbeliever without grounds, thenhe himself is what he said</B><P>5752. Abu Salama related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If a man says to his brother,'O unbeliever,' then it goes back to one of them.'"<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Abu Salama from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace.<P>5753. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If any man saysto his brother, 'O unbeliever,' then it goes back to one of them.'"<P>5754. Abu Qilaba related from Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears by a religionother than Allah falsely is as he said. Whoever kills himself with somethingwill be punished by it in the Fire of Jahannam. Cursing a believer is likekilling him. If someone accuses a believer of unbelief, it is like killinghim."<P><P><B>LXXIV. The one who did not consider as a kafir the one who said that basedon an interpretation or out of ignorance</B><P>'Umar said about Hatib ibn Abi Balta'a, "He is a hypocrite." The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "What will tell you? PerhapsAllah has looked at the people of Badr and said, 'I have forgiven them.'"<P>5755. 'Amr ibn Dinar related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that Mu'adh ibn Jabalused to pray with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Thenhe went to his people and led them in the prayer and recited <I>Suratal-Baqara</I>. A man left and prayed a quick prayer on his own. Mu'adh heardabout that and said, "He is a hypocrite." The man heard about that and wentto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messengerof Allah, we are a people who work with our hands and irrigate with our camels.Yesterday Mu'adh led us in the prayer and recited al-Baqara, so I prayedon my own. He claims that I am a hypocrite.' The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Mu'adh, you a causer of trial!" three times."Recite <I>ash-Shams </I>(91) and <I>al-A'la </I>(87) or something similar[in length]."<P>5756. Humayd related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "If any of you swears, and says in hisoath, 'By al-Lat and al-'Uzza,' he should say, 'There is no god but Allah.'If anyone says to his companion, 'Come on I will make a bet with you,' heshould give <I>sadaqa</I>."<P>5757. Nafi' related that Ibn 'Umar found 'Umar ibn al-Khattab in a retinuewhile he was swearing by his father. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, called him, "Allah has forbidden you to swear byyour fathers! If someone swears, he should swear by Allah or remain silent."<P><P><B>LXXV. What is permitted when one is anger or severe for Allah's command</B><P>Allah says, <I>"O Prophet! Do jihad against the rejectors and the hypocritesand be harsh with them." </I>(9:73)<P>5758. Al-Qasim related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, visited me while there was a curtain which had images.His face changed colour and then he took the curtain and tore it down. TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The people withthe worst punishment of the Day of Rising will be those who make these images.'"<P>5759. Qays ibn Abi Hazim related that Abu Mas'ud said, "A man came to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I only failto go to the morning prayer because so-and-so makes the prayer long whenhe leads us in it." He said, 'I have never seen the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, as angry as he was in giving admonitionon that day. He said, 'O people! Some of you make people averse. Whoeverof you leads people in the prayer, should make it short. Among you are thosewho are ill, the old and those who has needs.'"<P>5760. Nafi' related that 'Abdullah said, "While the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was praying, he saw some phlegm in the qibla ofthe mosque. He scraped it with his hand and was angered. Then he said, 'Whenone of you is praying, Allah is in front of him, so he should not spit infront of him during the prayer.'"<P>5761. Yazid, the client of al-Munba'idh, related from Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani:"A man asked the Prophet about finding a lost article. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Publicise it for a year. Then notethe details of its container and secure it. Then make use of it, but giveit to its owner if he comes.' Then he said, 'Messenger of Allah, what abouta lost sheep?' and he said, 'Take it. It is for you, your brother or thewolf.' Then he said, 'Messenger of Allah, what about a lost camel?' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, became so angry that his cheeksbecame red, (or his face became red). He said, 'It has nothing to do withyou. It has its feet and its water until its owner finds it.'"<P>5762. Busr ibn Said related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made a small room from palmleaves or mats. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, came out and prayed in it. Some men came looking for him and cameand joined him in his prayer. They came one and night and were ready. TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was slow incoming out to them and so they raised their voices and threw pebbles at thedoor. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cameout to them angry and said, 'You continued to do this until I feared thatit would become obligatory for you. You must pray in your homes. A man'sbest prayer is the one he prays in his house with the exception of the obligatoryprayer.'"<P><P><B>LXXVI. Warning against anger</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "Those who avoid major wrong actions andindecencies and who, when they are angered, then forgive" </I>(42:37) and<I>"Those who give in times of both ease and hardship, those who controltheir rage and pardon other people. Allah loves good-doers." </I>(3:134)<P>5763. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The strong man isnot the one who throws people in wrestling. The strong man is the one whohas control of himself when he is angry."<P>5764. 'Adi ibn Thabit related that Sulayman ibn Surd said, "While we weresitting with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, two menwere quarrelling and one of them insulted his companion and his face becamered with anger. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'I know a word and if he says it, it will remove what he feels. He shouldsay, 'I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan.' They said to theman, 'Did you not hear what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, is saying?' He retorted, 'I am not mad!'"<P>5765. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that a man said to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Advise me." He said, "Do not getangry" and repeated that several times, saying, "Do not get angry."<P><P><B>LXXVII. Modesty</B><P>5766. It is related that Abu's-Sawwar al-'Adawi said, "I heard 'Imran ibnHusayn say that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Modesty only brings good.' Bushayr ibn Ka'b then said, 'It is written inbooks of wisdom that modesty brings about gravity. Modesty brings abouttranquillity.' 'Imran said to him, 'I relate to you from the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and you relate to me fromyour pages!'"<P>5767. Salim related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar: "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, passed by a man who was rebuking his brother forbeing overly modest, saying, 'You are so shy that I fear that it will harmyou. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Leave him be. Modesty is a branch of faith."<P>5768. Abu 'Abdullah ibn Abi 'Utba said that he heard Abu Sa'id say, "TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to more modest thana virgin in her tent."<P><P><B>LXXVIII. If you do not feel ashamed, then do whatever you wish</B><P>5769. Rib'i ibn Hirash related that Abu Mas'ud said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Part of what has reached people ofthe words of the earliest prophethood is: if you do not have modesty, thendo whatever you like.'"<P><P><B>LXXIX. One should be embarrassed about the truth in order to gainunderstanding in the <I>deen</I></B><P>5770. Zaynab bint Abi Salama related that Umm Salama said, "Umm Sulaym wentto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,'Messenger of Allah, Allah is not ashamed of the truth. Does a woman havea ghusl when she has a wet dream?' 'Yes,' he answered, 'when she sees liquid.'"<P>5771. Muharib ibn Dithar heard Ibn 'Umar say,"The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'The example of a believer is like a greentree. Its leaves do not fall and do not drop off.' They said, 'It issuch-and-such a tree. It is such-and-such a tree.' I wanted to say, "It isthe palm tree. I was young boy and was too shy. Then he said, 'It is thepalm tree.'"<P>Hafs ibn 'Asim related the like from Ibn 'Umar. He added, "I told 'Umar aboutit and he said, 'I would have preferred that you had said it to such-and-such.'"<P>5772. Thabit said that he heard Anas say, "A woman came to offer herself[in marriage] to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Sheasked, 'Do you have any need of me?' Anas's daughter said, 'What little modestyshe had!' Anas said, 'She was better than you. She offered herself to theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"<P><P><B>LXXX. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"Make things easy and do not make them difficult."</B><P>He used to like to make things light and easy for people.<P>5773. Sa'id ibn Abi Burda related from his father that his grandfather said,"When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, senthim and Mu'adh ibn Jabal, he said to them, "Make things easy and do not makethem difficult. Give them good news and do not make them feel aversion. Obeyone another." Abu Musa said, "Messenger of Allah, we are in a land wherethey make a drink from honey called <I>bit' </I>and a drink from barley called<I>mizr</I>." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace,said, "Every intoxicant in unlawful."<P>5774. Abu't-Tayyah said that he heard Anas say that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Make things easy and do not make themdifficult.

There was a man among us who had a differentopinion [to the people of the <I>Sunna</I>, i.e. he was a Kharijite]. Hebegan to say, 'Look at this old man! He left his prayer because of a horse!'Abu Barza came and said, 'Since I parted from the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, no one has rebuked me!'

Your wife has a right on you. I hopethat you will have a long life. It is enough for you to fast three days ofevery month. Every good action is multiplied by ten and so that will be likefasting all the time.' I made things hard and so they were made hard forme. I said, 'I can do more than that.' He said, 'Fast three days out of everyweek.' I made things harm and so they were made hard for me. I said, 'I cando more than that.'

They said, 'Messenger of Allah,it is a matter which we did not see.' He said, 'Then the Jews can clearthemselves by fifty men taking an oath.' They said, 'Messenger of Allah,they are people of the unbelievers!'

They will leave the deen likethe arrow passes through game. He looks at his arrowhead and there is nothingon it. Then he looks at the mount of its head and there is nothing on it.He will look at its shaft and there is nothing on it. Then he will look atits feathers and there will be nothing on them, for it has been too fastfor excrement and blood. They will emerge when there are parties among thepeople.

It is a hard business.Do you have any camels?. 'Yes,' he answered. He asked, 'Do you pay<I>zakat</I> on them?" He said, 'Yes.'

Do not revert to beingunbelievers after I have gone, cutting each other's throats."<P>An-Nadr reported that Shu'ba said, "<I>Wayhakum</I>" ("Mercy on you"). 'Umaribn Muhammad reported that his father said, "<I>Waylakum</I>".<P>5815. Qatada related from Anas that a man from the desert Arabs came to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger ofAllah, when will the Final Hour come?" He said, "Bother you! What have youprepared for it?" He said, "I have prepared nothing for it, except that Ilove Allah and His Messenger." He said, "You will be with those you love."Anas said, "We asked, 'And us as well?' He answered, 'Yes. That day we werevery happy indeed. A slave belonging to al-Mughira passed by and he was ofmy generation. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'If this one should live long, he will not become senile before the FinalHour comes.'"<P>Shu'ba has it in brief from Qatada who said, "I heard Anas report from theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace..."<P><P><B>XCVI.

Abu Wa'il related that Abu Musa said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was asked, 'What about a man who loves some peoplebut has not joined them?'" Abu Mu'awiya and Muhammad ibn 'Ubayd corroboratedit.<P>5819. Salim ibn Abi'l-Ja'd related from Anas ibn Malik that a man asked theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. "Messenger of Allah, whenwill the Final Hour come?" He said, "What have you prepared for it?" He answered,"I have not prepared for it a lot of prayer, fasting and <I>sadaqa</I>, butI love Allah and His Messenger." He said, "You will be with the one who love."<P><P><B>XCVII.

Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said to Ibn Sayyad, 'I have hidden something for you. What isit?' 'Smoke (<I>dukhkh</I>),' he answered.<P>5821. Salim ibn 'Abdullah related that Ibn 'Umar told him, "'Umar ibn Khattabwent with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a groupof his Companions to visit Ibn Sayyad. He found him playing with some childrenin the hills of Banu Maghala. Ibn Sayyad, who was approaching puberty, didnot notice them until the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,patted his back with his hand and then said, 'Do you testify that I am theMessenger of Allah?' Ibn Sayyad looked at him and said, 'I testify that youare the Messenger of the unlettered.' Ibn Sayyad then said to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Do you testify that I am the Messengerof Allah?' He refuted it and said, 'I have believed in Allah and His Messengers.'Then he said to him, What do you think?' Ibn Sayyad said, 'Both truthfulpeople and liars come to me.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'You are in a state of confusion.' Then the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'I am concealing somethingfrom you.' Ibn Sayyad said, 'It is just smoke.' He said, 'Shame on you! Donot go too far.' 'Umar said, 'Messenger of Allah, give me permission to cuthis head off.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'If it is him, you will not be able to get the better of him. If it is nothim, there is no point in killing him.'"<P>Salim said that he heard 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar say, "After that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Ubayy ibn Ka'b al-Ansariwent to the palm-grove where Ibn Sayyad was staying. When the Messenger ofAllah* entered, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, began to conceal himself behind some palm trunks, trying to hear somethingfrom Ibn Sayyad before he saw him. He was lying down on his bed in a sheetof his murmuring. Ibn Sayyad's mother saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, concealing himself among the palm trunks andshe said to Ibn Sayyad, 'Saf! (which was his name) This is Muhammad.' SoIbn Sayyad stopped. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'If she had left him, it would have been clear.'"<P>Salim also reported that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, stood up among the people and praised Allah as He deservesand then he mentioned the Dajjal and said, 'I warn you about him, and thereis no Prophet who did not warn his people about him. Nuh warned his peopleabout him, but I will say something to you which no Prophet has said to hispeople. You should know that he is one-eyed and that Allah is not one-eyed.'"<P>Abu 'Abdullah said, <I>"khasa'a"</I> is used towards a dog when you driveit away. <I>"Khasi'in" </I>(2:65) means "put far away".<P><P><B>XCVIII. A man saying, "Welcome"</B><P>'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidto Fatima, peace be upon her, "Welcome, my daughter."<P>Umm Hani' said.

Abu Jamra related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the delegation of thetribe of 'Abdu'l-Qays came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, he said, 'Welcome to the delegation who have come. May you notsuffer disgrace nor regret!' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, we are a tribeof Rabi'a, and Mudar is between us and you, so we can only come to you inthe sacred month. Give us some clear instructions by which we may enter Paradiseand which we can convey to those we left behind.' He said, 'Four and four.Establish the prayer, pay zakat. fast Ramadan, and give a fifth of the booty.Do not drink from the <I>dubba'</I>, <I>hantam</I>, <I>naqir</I> and<I>muzaffat</I> [different kinds of wine vessels]."<P><P><B>XCIX. Calling people by their fathers's names</B><P>5823. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, &nbsp;may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "A banner will be raised for the traitor onthe Day of Rising. It will be said, 'This is the treachery of so-and-so sonof so-and-so.'"<P>5824. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A banner will be raised forthe traitor on the Day of Rising. 'This is the treachery of so-and-so sonof so-and-so.'"<P><P><B>C. One should not say, "My self is digusted"</B><P>5825. 'Urwa related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "None of you should say, 'My self is disgusted(<I>khabuthat</I>),' but rather he should say, 'My self is annoyed(<I>laqisat</I>).'"<P>5826. Abu Umama ibn Sahl related from his father that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you should say, 'My self isdisgusted (<I>khabuthat</I>),' but rather he should say, 'My self is annoyed(<I>laqisat</I>).'"<P>'Uqayl corroborated it.<P><P><B>CI. Do not curse time</B><P>5827. Abu Salama reported from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah said, 'The sons of Adamcurse time, and I am time. Night and day are in My hand."<P>5828. Abu Salama reported from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not call the grape-vine(<I>'inab</I>) '<I>karm</I>' and do not say, 'The loss of time. Allah istime.'"<P>[<B>NOTE</B>: In the Jahiliyya they used to call the vine '<I>karm</I>' (whichcomes from the root meaning 'generous') and they also called the wine whichwas made from it '<I>karm</I> 'and thought that drinking it made one nobleand generous (<I>karam</I>). This is why they honoured (<I>karrama</I>) thosewho drank it. The Shari'a disliked this because it affirmed their delusionsabout wine.]<P><P><B>CII. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"<I>Karm</I> is the heart of the believer."</B><P>He said, "The one who is truly bankrupt is the one who is bankrupt on theDay of Rising," as he said, "The strong person is the one who controls himselfwhen he is angry."<P>He also said, "There is no king except Allah." He described Him as havingthe ultimate kingdom. He also mentioned kings and quoted, <I>"Kings, whenthey enter a city, lay waste to it." </I>(27:34)<P>5829. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab reported from Abu Hurayra that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "They say'<I>karm</I>', but '<I>karm</I>' is the heart of the believer."<P>[The believer is more entitled to the name because of the light of faithand taqwa in his heart.]<P><P><B>CIII. The words of a man, "May my father and mother be your ransom."</B><P>In it az-Zubayr reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>5830. 'Abdullah ibn Shaddad related that 'Ali said, "I did not hear the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say to anyone that theyshould be their ransom except for Sa'd. I heard him say, 'Shoot, may my fatherand mother be your ransom.' I think that it was in the Battle of Uhud."<P><P><B>CIV. A man saying, "May Allah make me your ransom"</B><P>Abu Bakr said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Mayour fathers and mothers be your ransom."<P>5831. Yahya ibn Abi Ishaq related from Anas ibn Malik that he and Abu Talhacame with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had Safiyya riding behind him onhis she-camel. When they had gone part of the way, the she-camel stumbledand the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his wife felloff. Abu Talha (he said, "I think he said.") leapt from his camel and cameto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying,'O Prophet of Allah! May Allah make me your ransom! Are you hurt at all?'He said, 'No, but see to the woman.' So Abu Talha threw a cloth over hisface and went towards her and threw his cloth over her, and the woman gotup. Then he saw them both onto their camel and they rode. They travelleduntil they could see Madina - or they were looking down over Madina. TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, '[We are] returning,repenting, worshipping, praising our Lord.' He continued to say it untilhe entered Madina."<P><P><B>CV. The names which Allah Almighty loves the most</B><P>5832. Ibn al-Munkadir related that Jabir said, "One of our men had a sonand named him al-Qasim. We said, 'We will not call you Abu'l-Qasim nor honouryou by that. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was informedand said, 'Name him 'Abdu'r-Rahman.'"<P><P><B>CVI. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;"Name yourselves with my name but do not use my <I>kunya</I>."</B><P>Anas said that, relating from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>5833. Salim related that Jabir said, "One of our men had a son and namedhim al-Qasim. They said, 'We will not give you that <I>kunya</I> until weask the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'Nameyourselves with my name but do not use my <I>kunya</I>.'"<P>5834. Ibn Sirin said from Abu Hurayra, "Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said. 'Name yourselves with my name but do not use my<I>kunya</I>.'"<P>5835. Ibn al-Munkadir related that Jabir said, "One of our men had a sonwhom he named al-Qasim. They said, 'We will not give you the <I>kunya</I>of Abu'l-Qasim and we will not delight you by doing so.' He went to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned that to him. He said,'Name your son 'Abdu'r-Rahman.'"<P><P><B>CVII. The Name al-Hazn (rough)</B><P>5836. Al-Musayyab related that his father went to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who asked, "What is your name?"He replied, "Hazn." He said, "You are Sahl (easy)." He said, "I will notchange a name with which my father named me." Ibn al-Musayyab said, "We havehad roughness in us ever since."<P>5837. Ibn al-Musayyab related this from his father from his grandfather.<P><P><B>CVIII. Changing a name to another name which is better than it</B><P>5838. Abu Hazim related that Sahl said, "When al-Mundhir ibn Abi Usayd wasborn, he was brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and he put him on his thigh while Abu Usayd was sitting there. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was occupied with something in frontof him and Abu Usayd told someone to take his son from his thigh. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished was he was doing and said,'Where is the boy?' Abu Usayd said, 'We sent him home, Messenger of Allah.'He asked, 'What is his name?' 'So-and-so,' he answered. He said, 'Ratherhis name is al-Mundhir.' and so he named him al-Mundhir from that day."<P>5839. Abu Rafi' related from Abu Hurayra that Zaynab's name had been Barra(pious) and it was said, "By that she declares herself pure." and so theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, renamed her Zaynab.<P>[This is said to be Zaynab bint Jahsh or Zaynab bint Abi Salama.]<P>5840. 'Abdu'l-Hamid ibn Jubayra ibn Shayba was reported to say. "I sat withSa'id ibn al-Musayyab and he related to me that his grandfather Hazm cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who asked, "Whatis your name?" He replied, "My name is Hazm." He said, 'Rather you are Sahl.'He said, 'I will not change a name with which my father named me.' Sahl ibnal-Musayyab said, 'We have had roughness (<I>huzuna</I>) in us ever since.'"<P><P><B>CIX. Those who named after the names of Prophets</B><P>Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, kissedIbrahim," i.e. his son.<P>5841. Isma'il said, "I asked Ibn Abi Awfa, 'Did you see Ibrahim, the sonof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' He said, 'He diedyoung. If there had been decreed that there be a Prophet after Muhammad,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, his son would have lived, but thereis no Prophet after him.'"<P>5842. 'Adi ibn Thabit related that he heard al-Bara' say, "When Ibrahim,peace be upon him, died, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'He has a wet-nurse in the Garden.'"<P>5843. Salim ibn Abi'l-Ja'd related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari saidthat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"Name yourselves with my name but not with my <I>kunya</I>. I am the divider(<I>qasim</I>) who divides between you." Anas related it from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>5844. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Name yourselves with my name but not withmy <I>kunya</I>. Whoever sees me in a dream has seen me. Shaytan does nottake on my form. Whoever deliberately lies about me should take his seatin the Fire."<P>5845. Abu Burda related that Abu Musa said, "I had a son and took him tothe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who named him Ibrahim.He rubbed his gums with a date and prayed for him to have blessing and thengave him back to me." He was the eldest son of Abu Musa.<P>5846. Ziyad ibn 'Ilaqa related that he heard al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba say, "Thesun was eclipsed on the day Ibrahim died."<P>Abu Bakr related it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>CX. Naming someone al-Walid</B><P>5847. Sa'id related that Abu Hurayra said, "When the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, raised his head from bowing, he said, 'O Prophet,save al-Walid ibn al-Walid, Salama ibn Hisham, 'Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'a, andthose who are victimised in Makka. O Allah, be harsh on Mudar. O Allah, imposeon them years like the years of Yusuf.'"<P><P><B>CXI. Whoever calls his friend and omits a letter from his name</B><P>Abu Hazim reported from Abu Hurayra, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said to me, 'Abu Hirr.'"<P>5848. Abu Salama ibn related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'A'ish, this is Jibril who gives you thegreeting.' I said, 'And on him peace and the mercy of Allah.'" She said,"He would see what we do not see."<P>5849. Abu Qilaba related that Anas said, "Umm Sulaym was with the baggagewhile Anjasha, the slave of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, was driving them. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Anjash! Drive the glass vessels gently!'"<P><P><B>CXII. Giving a child a <I>kunya</I> and giving someone a <I>kunya</I>before he has children</B><P>5850. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, was the best of people in character. I had a brother calledAbu 'Umayr. I think he had recently been weaned. When he was brought, theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would say, 'Abu 'Umayr,what happened with the little bird?' He had a little bird with which he usedto play. Once the time of prayer came while he was in our house. He commandthat the rug which was under him be swept and sprinkled and then he wouldstand and we would stand behind him and he would lead us in the prayer."<P><P><B>CXIII. Giving someone the <I>kunya</I> Abu Turab (father of dust), evenif someone has another <I>kunya</I></B><P>5851. Abu Hazim related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "The name which 'Ali mostloved was Abu Turab. He used to be happy when he was called that. It wasnone other than the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whonamed him that. One day 'Ali was angry with Fatima and went out and sleptby a wall in the mosque. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,came to look for him and someone said, 'He s sleeping by the wall.' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to him while 'Ali's back wascovered in dust. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, beganto wipe off the dust from his back, saying, 'Sit up, Abu Turab!'"<P><P><B>CXIV. The name which Allah most hates</B><P>5852. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The most ignoble name in thesight of Allah on the Day of Rising will be a man who calls himself 'theking of kings'."<P>5853. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra, "The most ignoble name in the sightof Allah." Sufyan said another time, "The most ignoble of names in the sightof Allah on the Day of Rising will be a man calling himself 'the king ofkings'" Sufyan said that someone else says that it means "Shahan Shah (Kingof Kings in Persian)."<P><P><B>CXV. The <I>kunya</I> of an idolater</B><P>5854. It is related from Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that Usama ibn Zayd reportedthat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rodea donkey with a cloth made in Fadak and Usama was riding behind him. He wentto visit Sa'd ibn 'Ubada in the Banu'l-Harith ibn al-Khazraj before the Battleof Badr. They went on and passed by a gathering which contained 'Abdullahibn Ubayy ibn Salul, and that was before 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy became Muslim.The gathering contained a mixture of Muslims, idolworshippers, pagans, andJews. The Muslims there included 'Abdullah ibn Rawaha. When the dust of thedonkey covered the gathering, 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy covered his nose with hiscloak and then said, "Don't cover us with dust!" The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, greeted them and then stopped, Hedismounted and invited them to Allah and recited the Qur'an to them. 'Abdullahibn Ubayy ibn Salul said, "O man! There is nothing better than what you sayif it is the truth. So do not annoy us with it in our gatherings. Returnto your mount and recount to whoever comes to you." 'Abdullah ibn Rawahasaid, "Indeed, Messenger of Allah! Bring it to us in our gatherings. We likethat!" So the Muslims, idolworshippers and Jews abused one another untilthey were practically fighting. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, kept on calming them down until they were quiet. Then the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mounted his animal and went untilhe visited Sa'd ibn 'Ubada. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said to him, "Sa'd, did you not hear what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullahibn Ubayy) said? He said such-and-such." Sa'd ibn 'Ubada said, "O Messengerof Allah, may my father be your ransom Pardon him and overlook it.By theOne who sent down the Book on you, Allah has brought the truth which He sentdown on you when the people of this town had agreed to crown him and bindhis head with a (royal) turban. When Allah refused that by the truth whichAllah gave you, he was vexed on that account. That is why he did what yousaw." So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,pardoned him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and hisCompanions used to pardon the idolworshippers and the People of the Bookas Allah commanded them and they endured harm. Allah, the Mighty and Exalted,said, <I>"You will hear many abusive words from those given the Book beforeyou and from those who worship idols," </I>(3:186) and Allah said,<I> "Manyof the People of the Book would love it if they could make you revert tobeing rejectors after you have believed..." </I>(2:109) The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, used to interpret this as meaning thathe should pardon them as long as Allah commanded that until Allah gave permissionregarding them. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, went on the Badr expedition, Allah killed the nobles of theunbelievers and the leaders of Quraysh and the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and his Companions returned victorious andwith booty with captives from the nobles of the nobles of the unbelieversand the leaders of Quraysh, then Ibn Ubayy ibn Salul and those of theidolworshippers and pagans with him, said, "This is a business which hasbeen victorious," and they gave allegiance to the Messenger, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, in Islam, and became Muslim."<P>5855. 'Abdullah ibn al-Harith ibn Nawfal related that 'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalibsaid, "Messenger of Allah, have you helped Abu Talib at all? He used to protectyou and become angry on your behalf." He said, "Yes, he is in the swallowestpart of the Fire. If it had not been for me, he would have been in the lowestrank of the Fire."<P><P><B>CXVI. Allusion, which is a recommended way to avoid lying</B><P>Ishaq said that he heard Anas say, "A son of Abu Talha died and he asked,'How is the boy?' Umm Sulaym answered, 'His breathing has stilled and I hopethat he is at rest.' He thought that she was telling the truth."<P>5856. Thabit al-Bunani reported that Anas ibn Malik said, "While the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on a journey, the driver ofthe camels was chanting and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'Gently, Anjasha. Mercy on you! Take care with the glass vessels.'"<P>5857. Abu Qilaba related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was on a journey and there was a slave called Anjashadriving the camels. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Go gently, Anjasha, while driving the glass vessels!'" Abu Qilabasaid that he meant the women.<P>It is related by Qatada that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, hada driver called Anjasha who had a good voice. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said to him, "Go gently, Anjasha, and do not breakthe glass vessels!'" Qatada said that he meant the weak women.<P>5858. Qatada related that Anas ibn Malik said, "There was an alarm in Madinaand the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rodea horse belonging to Abu Talha. He said, "We did not see anything. We foundit [the horse] like a sea."<P><P><B>CXVII. A man saying about something, "It is nothing," meaning that itis not true</B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said about (the inhabitants of) two graves, 'They are being torturedand not for anything great, but it is great."<P>5859. 'Urwa was heard to say that 'A'isha said, "Some people asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about soothsayers andthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said tothem, 'They have nothing.' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, sometimes theytell us something and then it turns out to be true.'
