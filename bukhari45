Book of the Decree (<I>Qadar</I>)</BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><P>6221. Zayd ibn Wahb related that 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who is the truthful confirmed one,said, 'The way that each of you is created is that you are gathered in yourmother's womb for forty days and then for a similar length of time as ablood-clot and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. ThenAllah sends an angel and orders him to write four things: his provision,life-span, and whether he will be wretched or happy. By Allah, one of you(or a man) can do the actions of someone destined for the Fire until thereis only an armspan between him and it, and then what is written will overtakehim and he will do the actions of someone destined for the Garden and willenter it. A man can do the actions of someone destined for the Garden untilthere is only an armspan between him and it, and then what is written willovertake him and he will do the actions of someone destined for the Fireand will enter it."<P>Adam said, <I>"'Illa' </I>instead of <I>'ghayr' </I>in 'only an armspan.'"<P>6222. 'Ubaydullah ibn Abi Bakr ibn Anas related from Anas ibn Malik thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah appointsan angel to every womb who says, 'O Lord! A sperm drop! O Lord A clot! OLord! A lump of flesh!' Then if Allah desires to complete His creation, Hedoes so and the angel asks, 'O Lord, is it to be male or female? Wretchedor happy? What is its provision? What is its life-span?' This is all decreedin the mother's womb."<P><P><B>I. The pen has dried with Allah's knowledge</B><P><I>"...whom Allah has misguided knowingly."</I> (45:23)<P>Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said to me, "The pen has become dry (after writing) what you will meet."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "'<I>They are the first to reach them'</I> (23:61) meansthat happiness has been decreed for them."<P>6223. Mutarrif ibn 'Abdullah ibn ash-Shikhkhir related that 'Imran ibn Husaynsaid, "A man said, 'Messenger of Allah, can the people of the Garden berecognised from the people of the Fire?' 'Yes,' he answered. He asked, 'Sowhy do those who act act?' He said, 'Everyone acts for that for which hewas created,' or 'that which was made easy for him.'"<P><P><B>II. Allah knows best what they would have done</B><P>6224. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was asked about the children of the idolatorsand he said, 'Allah knows best what they would have done.'"<P>6225. 'Ata' ibn Yazid reported that he heard Abu Hurayra say, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked about the offspringof idolators and he said, 'Allah knows best what they would have done.'"<P>6226. Hammam related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no child who is not born onthe natural form and then his parents make him Jewish or Christian, justas an animal gives birth to a whole animal. Do you expect it to be mutilateduntil you mutilate it?' They asked, "Messenger of Allah, what do you thinkabout those who die young?" He answered, "Allah has the best knowledge aboutwhat they would have done."<P><P><B>III. <I>"Allah's command is a pre-ordained decree." </I>(33:38)</B><P>6227. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A woman should not ask for hersister to be divorced so that she can enjoy her portion, but she should marry.She will have what is decreed for you."<P>6228. Abu 'Uthman related that Usama said, "I was with the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, with Sa'd, Ubayy ibn Ka'b and Mu'adh whena messenger came from one of his daughters came saying that her son was dying.He sent to her, 'Allah takes is His and what He gives is His. Everythinghas a fixed term with Him, so she should show fortitude and expect a reward.'"<P>6229. 'Abdullah ibn Muhayriz al-Jumahi reported that Abu Sa'id al-Khudrireported that while he was sitting with the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, a man of the Ansar came and said, 'Messenger of Allah,we have intercourse with captives but we want a good price for them, so whatdo you think about coitus interruptus?' He said, 'Do you do that? You shouldnot do that. There is no soul that Allah has written will exist, withoutit then coming into existence.'"<P>6230. Abu Wa'il related that Hudhayfa said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, addressed us in a <I>khutba</I> in which he didnot omit to mention anything until the time of the Final Hour. Whoever knowsis knows it, and whoever is ignorant of it is ignorant of it. Then I wouldsee something that I had forgotten, and I would recognise it as a man recognisesanother man when he has been absent from him and then he sees him and recogniseshim."<P>6231. 'Abdu'r-Rahman as-Sulami related that 'Ali said, "We were sitting withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who had a stick withwhich he began to make marking on the ground. He said, 'There is none ofyou but that his place in the Garden or his place in the Fire is writtenfor him.' A man of the people said, 'Messenger of Allah, shall we not relyon this?' He said, 'No. Act. Each is eased.' Then he recited, <I>'As forhim who gives out and has taqwa ...</I>' (92:5)"<P><P><B>IV. Actions depend on their seals</B><P>6232. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related that Abu Hurayra said, "We were presentat Khaybar with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said about a man who was one of those with him who claimed to be a Muslim,'This is one of the people of the Fire,' When the fighting started, the manfought fiercely, received several wounds and was rendered immobile. One ofthe Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cameand said, 'Messenger of Allah, did you see the one you reported was one ofthe people of the Fire? He fought fiercely in the Cause of Allah and hasreceived many wounds.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'And yet he is one of the people of the Fire.' Some of the Muslimswere unsure and while that man was like that, he felt such great pain fromthe wounds that he put his hand into his quiver and took out an arrow andkilled himself with it. Some Muslim men hurried to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allahhas confirmed what you said. So-and-so has committed suicide and killed himself.'the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Bilal,get up and announce: "Only a believer will enter the Garden. Allah may supportthis <I>deen</I> with an impious man."'"<P>6233. Abu Hazim related from Sahl: "There was a man who was one of the greatestof the Muslims in defending the Muslims in one of the expeditions which hewent on with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked and said, 'Whoever wantsto look at a man of the people of the Fire should look at this man.' Oneman of the people followed him and he continued like that, one of the boldestof people in fighting against the idolaters until he was wounded. Then hehastened his death by placing the hilt on his sword in the earth and pointat his breast and then he fell on it so that it emerged through his shoulders.The man went quickly to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and said, 'I testify that you are the Prophet!' He asked, 'Why is that?'He said, 'You said to so-and-so, "Whoever wants to look at a man of the peopleof the Fire should look at this man."' He was one of the boldest? of us indefending the Muslims and I knew that he would not die like that. When hewas wounded, he hastened his death and killed himself.' The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, then said, 'Someone can perform theactions of the people of the Fire when he is one of the people of the Garden,and he might perform the actions of the people of the Garden while he isone of the people of the Fire. Actions are according to their seals.'"<P><P><B>V. Someone making a vow about something which is decreed</B><P>6234. 'Abdullah ibn Murra related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, forbade vows and said, 'It does notrepel anything, and extracts something from the miser."<P>6235. Hammam ibn Munabbih from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Vowing does not bring anything to the sonof Adam which I have decreed for, but the decree meets him with what I havedecreed for him. By it I extract something from the miser."<P><P><B>VI. There is no power nor strength except by Allah</B><P>6236. Abu 'Uthman an-Nahdi related that Abu Musa said, "We were with theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and wheneverwe climbed up above a valley, we would say, 'There is no god but Allah andAllah is greater" with our voices raised. The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'O people! Be kind to yourselves! You are notcalling someone who is deaf or absent. He is with you, near and hearing.'Then he said, ''Abdullah ibn Qays, shall I teach you an expression whichis one of the treasures of the Garden? 'There is no power nor strength exceptby Allah.'"<P><P><B>VII. The one who is protected is the one whom Allah protects</B><P>'Asim (11;43) is a protector. Mujahid said that "<I>saddan</I>" (36:9) isbarring from the truth. They waver in misguidance." "<I>Dassaha</I>" (91:10):means he made it err.<P>6237. Abu Salama related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophe, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "No khalif is appointed but that hehas two close advisors: one commands him to do good and encourages him todo that, and the other commands him to evil and encourages him to do that.The one who is protected is the one that Allah protects."<P><P><B>VIII. <I>"There is a ban on any city We have destroyed; they will notreturn." </I>(21:95)</B><P><I>"None of your people are going to believe except for those who alreadyhave believed..." </I>(11:36)<P><I>"They will spawn nothing but more dissolute unbelievers."</I> (71:27)<P>Mansur ibn an-Nu'man reported from 'Ikrima that Ibn 'Abbas said,"'<I>Hirm</I>' in Abyssinian means 'it is incumbent.'"<P>6238. Tawus related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I did not see anything more likeminor sins than what Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Allah has written for the son of Adam a shareof fornication which he must commit. The fornication of the eyes is the lookand the fornication of the tongue is the speech. The self wishes and desiresand the private parts confirm all of this or deny it."<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace.<P><P><B>IX. <I>"We only appointed the vision We showed you and the Accursed Treein the Qur'an as a trial and temptation for the people." </I>(17:60)</B><P>6239. 'Ikrima related from Ibn 'Abbas about the words, <I>"We only appointedthe vision We showed you as a trial and temptation for the people" </I>(17:60),"It is the vision of the eye of what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was shown on the Night Journey to Jerusalem." hesaid, "The accursed tree in the Qur'an is the tree of Zaqqum."<P><P><B>X. Adam and Musa arguing in the presence of Allah</B><P>6240. Tawus related that he heard Abu Hurayra relate that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Adam and Musa argued, and Musasaid to him, 'Adam, you are our father and you expelled us from the Garden.'Adam said to him, 'Musa, Allah choose you for His word and wrote? for youwith His own hand. Do you blame me for a business which Allah decreed fortyyears before He created me?' So Adam argued against Musa and Musa arguedagainst Musa." He repeated it three times.<P>Another <I>isnad</I> with the like from al-A'raj from Abu Hurayra from theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>XI. None can hold back what Allah gives</B><P>6241. It is related that Warrad, the client of al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said,"Mu'awiya wrote to al-Mughira, 'Write for me something which you heard theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying after the prayer.'Al-Mughira dictated to me, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, say when he finished the prayer, "There is no god but Allahalone with no partner. O Allah, none can prevent what Allah gives and nonecan give what He withholds. The wealth of someone with wealth will not helphim with You.'"<P>Ibn Jurayj said that 'Abda reported to him that Warrad reported this to him."Then after that I came to Mu'awiya and heard him commanding people to saythat."<P><P><B>XII. The one who seeks refuge with Allah from consequences of misery andan evil decree.</B><P>The words of Allah, <I>"Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Daybreak, fromthe evil of what He has created..."</I> (113:1-2)<P>6242. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Seek refuge with Allah from affliction, theconsequences of hardship, an evil decree and the gloating of enemies."<P><P><B>XIII<I>. "Allah intervenes between a man and his heart"</I> (8:24)</B><P>6243. Salim related that 'Abdullah said, "Part of what the Prophet , mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, used to often say in making an oathwas 'No, by the Overturner of hearts."<P>6244. Salim related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said to Ibn Sawwad, 'I have concealed something fromyou.' He said, 'Adh-Dukh.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'Be quiet, You cannot exceed your fate.' 'Umar said, 'Give mepermission to strike his neck!' 'Leave him,' he answered. 'If it is him,you will not be able to do it. If it not him, then there is no good in yourkilling him.'"<P><P><B>XIV. <I>"Say: 'Nothing can happen to us except what Allah has ordainedfor us." </I>(9:51)</B><P>Mujahid said, "<I>Bi-fatinina</I>" (37:162) means misguided, those for whomAllah has written that they will burn in Hellfire."<P><I>"Qaddarra fa-hada" </I>(87:3): He decreed misery and happiness and guidedlivestock to their grazing pasture."<P>6245. Yahya ibn Ya'mar related that 'A'isha told him that she asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about the plague and hesaid, "It is a punishment which Allah sends against whomever He will. Allahhas made it a mercy for the believers. There is no one who is where the plagueoccurs and who remains in his land with steadfastness and in expectationof the reward, knowing that only what Allah has written for him will befallhim, but that he has the like of the reward of the martyr."<P><P><B>XV. <I>"We would not have been guided, had Allah not guided us."</I>(7:43)</B><P><I>"If only Allah had guided me, I would have had been among the godfearing."</I>(39:57)<P>6246. Abu Ishaq related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "I saw the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the Battle of the Ditch movingearth with us while he was saying:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  'If it had not been for You,  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we would not have been guided nor given <I>sadaqa</I>  nor fasted,  <P>  So send down tranquillity on us  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and make our feet firm when we meet [the enemy].  <P>  Those have wronged us,  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but we refuse if they desire to tempt us.  <P>  ____________________________________________</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><BIG><A NAME="oaths">10245. Books of Oaths and Vows</A></BIG></B><P><P>Allah Almighty says, <I>"Allah does not take you to task for your inadvertentoaths, but He will take you to task for oaths you make intentionally.Theexpiation in that case is to feed ten poor people with the average amountyou feed your family, or clothe them, or free a slave. Anyone without themeans to do so should fast three days. That is the expiation for breakingoaths when you have sworn them. Keep your oaths. In this way Allah makesHis Signs clear to you, so that hopefully you will be thankful." </I>(5:89)<P>6247. 'A'isha related that Abu Bakr never broke any of his oaths until Allahrevealed the expiation of oaths. Then he said, "If I take an oath about somethingand then see that someone else is better than it, I will do that which isbetter and expiate my oath."<P>6248. Al-Hasan related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Samura said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, ''Abdu'r-Rahman ibnSamura. Do not ask for leadership. If you are given it without asking forit, then you will be helped in it. If you are given it through asking forit, then it will be left up to you. If you make a vow and then see somethingother than it which is better than it, then do that which is better and expiateyour oath.'"<P>6249. Abu Burda related that his father, Abu Musa, said, "I went to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a group of Ash'arites to askhim to give us mounts. He said, 'By Allah, I will not give you mounts andI do not have anything which you can ride.' Then we stayed there as longas Allah wished us to stay and then three camels with white humps were broughtto him and he had us ride them. When we left, we &#150; or some of us &#150;said, 'By Allah, we will have no blessing! We went to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, to ask him for mounts and he swore that hewould not give us mounts and then he gave us mounts. Return to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and remind him.' We went to himand he said, 'I did not give you mounts. Allah gave you mounts. By Allah,Allah willing, I will never swear an oath and then see something better thanit but that I will expiate it and do that which is better (or do that willis better and expiate my oath.'"<P>6250. Hammam ibn Munabbih said that Abu Hurayra related that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "We are the last, but &nbsp;willbe the forerunners on the Day of Rising." The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "By Allah, if any of you insists onperforming an oath which will harm his family, he does a greater wrong actionin the sight of Allah than giving its expiation which Allah has imposed forit."<P>6251. 'Ikrima related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone insists on carryingout an oath about his family does a greater wrong. He should do what is good,"i.e. expiate it.<P><P><B>I. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"Yes, by Allah (<I>waymu'llah</I>)"</B><P>6252. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent an expedition and butUsama ibn Zayd in command of it. Some people criticised his leadership. TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and said,'If you attack your leadership, you attacked the leadership of his fatherbefore. By Allah, he was worthy of leadership. and he was one of the mostbeloved of people to me. This is one of the most beloved of people to meafter him.'"<P><P><B>II. What was the oath of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, like?</B><P>Sa'd said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Bythe One who has my soul in His hand.'"<P>Abu Qatada said, "Abu Bakr said in the presence of the Prophet, 'No, by Allah(<I>laaha Allah</I>).'"<P>It is said, "<I>Wallahu</I>, <I>billahi</I>, and <I>tallahi</I>."<P>6253. Salim related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The oath of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was, No, by the Overturner of hearts."<P>6254. 'Abdu'l-Malik related from Jabir ibn Samura that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "When Caesar dies, there will be noCaesar after him. When Chosroes dies, there will be no Chosroes after him.By the One who had my soul in His hand, you will spend their treasures inthe way of Allah."<P>6255. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When Chosroes dies,there will be no Chosroes after him. When Caesar dies, there will be no Caesarafter him. By the One who has the soul of Muhammad in His hand, you willspend their treasures in the way of Allah."<P>6256. 'A'isha related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "O community of Muhammad, by Allah, if you were to know whatI knew, they would weep much and laugh little."<P>6257. Abu 'Uqayl Zuhra ibn Ma'bad related that he heard his grandfather,'Abdullah ibn Hisham say, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, while he was holding the hand of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab.'Umar said to him, 'Messenger of Allah, you are dearer to me than anythingexcept my self.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'No, by the One who has my soul in His had, not until I am dearer to youthan your self.' 'Umar said to him, 'Now, by Allah, you are dearer to methan my self.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Now, 'Umar!'"<P>6258. Abu Hurayra and Zayd ibn Khalid reported that two men took a disputeto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and oneof them said, "Judge between us by the Book of Allah," and the other said,who had more understanding, said, "Yes, Messenger of Allah, judge betweenus by the Book of Allah and give me leave to speak." "Speak," he said. Hesaid, "My son is a labourer for this man (Malik said that <I>'asif</I> meansa labourer) and he committed fornication with his wife. They told me thatmy son must be stoned, and so I ransomed my son with a hundred sheep anda slave-girl of mine. Then I asked the people of knowledge and they toldme that my son must receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for a year andthat it is wife who is to be stoned." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "By the One who has my soul in His hand, Iwill judge between the two of you by the Book of Allah. The slave-girl andsheep must be returned to you." Then he gave his son a hundred lashes andexiled him for a year. He commanded Unays al-Aslami to go to the wife ofthe other man and that if she confessed, he was to stone her. She confessedand he stoned her.<P>6259. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr related from his father that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do you think that if thetribes of Aslam, Ghifar, Muzayna and Juhayna were better than Tamim, 'Amiribn Sa'sa'a. Ghatafan and Asad, they have failed and have lost?" "Yes," theyanswered. He said, "By the One who has my soul in His hand, they are betterthan them."<P>6260. 'Urwa related from Humayd as-Sa'idi that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, employed a collector. When he finishedhis collection, the collector came and said, "Messenger of Allah, this isfor you and this was given as a gift to me." He said, "Why did you not sitin the house of your father or mother to see whether a gift would come toyou or not?"<P>Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stoodup in the evening after the prayer and praised Allah as is proper for him,Then he said, "Following on from that, what is wrong with the agent we employed?He came to us and said, 'This is your work and this was given as a gift forme.' Why did he not sit in the house of his father or mother to see whethera gift would come to him or not? By the One who has my soul in His hand,none of you will take anything without right but that he will carry it onhis back on the Day of Rising, be it a camel which is grumbling, or a cowwhich is mooing, or a sheep which is bleating. I have conveyed it."<P>Abu Humayd said, "Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, raised his hands until we could see the whites of his armpits."Abu Humayd said that he heard that from Zayd ibn Thabit from the Prophet,so ask him.<P>6261. Hammam related from Abu Hurayra that Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "By the One who has the soul of Muhammad in hishand, if you knew what I knew, you would weep much and laugh little."<P>6262. Al-Ma'rur related that Abu Dharr said, "I went to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was saying in theshade of the Ka'ba, 'They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka'ba. Theyare the losers, by the Lord of the Ka'ba.' I said, 'What is the matter withme? Does he see something in me? What is the matter with me?' I sat besidehim while he was saying this. I could not remain silent and I was distressedas Allah wished.' I said, 'Who are they, may my father and mother be yourransom, Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'They are those with the most wealthexcept for the one who spends like this, like this and like this.'"<P>6263. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Sulayman said, 'I will go aroundtonight to ninety wives and each woman will produce a warrior who will fightin the way of Allah.' His companion angel said to him, 'Say, "Allah willing."'He did not say it and forgot. He went around to them and none of them gavebirth except a woman who had half a person. By the One who has the soul ofMuhammad in His hand, if he had said, 'Allah willing', they would all havefought in the Way of Allah as warriors.'"<P>6264. Abu'l-Ahwas related from Abu Ishaq that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "Apiece of silk was given to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and the people began to pass it around between them and admired itsbeauty and softness. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'Does it astonish you?' 'Yes, Messenger of Allah,' theyanswered. He said, 'By the One who has my soul in His hand, the handkerchiefof Sa'd in the Garden is better than it."<P>Shu'ba and Isra'il did not report from Abu Ishaq, "By the One who has mysoul in His hand."<P>6265. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr related that 'A'isha said, ""Hind bint 'Uqba ibnRabi'a said, 'Messenger of Allah, there was no person dwelling on the faceof the earth whose family I wished to see abased more than your family. Nowtoday that is person dwelling on the face of the earth whose family I wishedto see exalted more than your family.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'As well, by the One who has my soulin His hand.' She said, 'Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyan is a grasping man.Is there anything against me if I feed my children from what he has?' Hesaid, "No, but only when it is reasonable."<P>6266. 'Amr ibn Maymun was heard to relate that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said,"While the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was restinghis back against a tent of Yemeni leather, he said to his Companions, "Areyou pleased that you will be a quarter of the people of the Garden?' Theysaid, 'Yes.' He said, 'Are you pleased to be a third of the people of theGarden?' They said, 'Yes.' He said, 'By the One who has the soul of Muhammadin His hand, I hope that you will be half of the people of the Garden.'"<P>6267. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri thata man heard another man recite, <I>"Say: 'He is Allah, the One'..."</I> (112:1)&nbsp;and repeating it. In the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned that to him and itappeared as if the man thought that it was little. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "By the One who has my soulin His hand, it is equal to a third of the Qur'an."<P>6268. Qatada related that Anas ibn Malik heard the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, say, "Do your prostration and bowing fully.

Salim related that Ibn 'Umar said, "I heard 'Umar say, 'The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, "Allah forbidsyou to swear by your fathers." ''Umar said, 'By Allah, since I heard theMessenger of Allah, &nbsp;may Allah bless him and grant him peace, I havenot swore by them either directly or when quoting someone else."<P>Mujahid said that<I> "Or any remnant of knowledge"</I> (46:4) is transmittedknowledge.<P>It is corroborated by 'Uqayl, az-Zubaydi and Ishaq al-Kalbi from az-Zuhri.<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Ibn 'Umar who said, "The Prophet* heard 'Umar..."<P>6272. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar related, "I heard 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar say, 'TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do notswear by your fathers."'"<P>6273. It is related that Zahdam said, "We were with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari,and there was friendship between us and this tribe of Jarm. He was broughtsome food which contained chicken meat. There was present with him a manfrom the Banu Taym who was reddish as if he were one of the Greek clients.He was invited to the food but he said, 'I saw them eating something filthyand I swore that I would not eat them.' Abu Musa said, 'Come and I will informyou about that. I came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, among the group of the Ash'arites, asking him to give usmounts. He said, 'By Allah, I will not give you mounts, and I do not haveany mounts to give you.' Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was brought some camels as booty. He asked about usand said, 'Where are the Ash'arites?' He commanded for us five camels withwhite humps. When we left, we said, 'What have we done? The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, swore an oath that he wouldnot give us any mounts and then he gave us mounts. We are taking advantage?of Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forgettinghis oath. By Allah, we will never prosper!' So we returned to him and said,'We came to you and asked you to give us mounts and you swore that you wouldnot give us mounts. and that you had no mounts to give us.' He said, 'I amnot the one who gave you mounts, but Allah gave you mounts. By Allah, I willnever make an oath and then see something better than it without doing thething that is better and then doing expiation for it.'"<P><P><B>IV. One should not swear by al-Lat or al-'Uzza or idols</B><P>6274.

He threw it away and thensaid, "By Allah, I will never wear it again." So the people threw their ringsaway."<P><P><B>VI. Someone who swears by a religion other than the religion of Islam</B><P>The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swearsby al-Lat and al-'Uzza should say, 'There is no god but Allah.'"<P>He did not accuse him of unbelief.<P>6276. Abu Qilaba related from Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears by a religionother than the religion of Islam is as he said." He also said, "Whoever killshimself with something will be punished with it in the Fire of Jahannam.Cursing a believer is like killing him. If someone accuses a believer ofunbelief, that is like killing him."<P><P><B>VI. Do not say, "What Allah wills and you will." Can someone say, "I amby Allah and then by you"?</B><P>6277. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi 'Amra reported that Abu Hurayra heard the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Allah desired to test threeof the tribe of Israel and so he sent an angel. He went to the leper andsaid, 'My means are cut off and I can obtain none except by Allah and byyou,'" and he mentioned the <I>hadith</I>.<P><P><B>VII.

She sentto him adjuring him to come to her. He got up and we got up with him. Whenhe sat down, the child was brought to him and placed in his lap and the childwas shuddering. The eyes of Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, were flowing with tears and Sa'd said, 'Messenger of Allah, whatis this?' He said, 'This is an aspect of mercy which Allah has put in thehearts of His slaves. Allah is merciful to His slaves who are merciful.'"<P>6280. Ibn al-Musayyab related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Any Muslim who has threeof his children die will not be touched by the Fire except for the fulfillingof the oath."<P>6281.

Abu Wa'il related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "whoever swears a false oath in order to obtainsome of the property of a Muslim man (or his brother) will find Allah agreewith him when he meets him." Allah revealed its confirmation, <I>"Those whosell Allah's contract and their own oaths for a paltry price.</I>" (3:77)<P>In his hadith, Sulayman said, "Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays passed by and asked, 'Whatdid 'Abdullah relate to you?' They told him and al-Ash'ath said, "It wasrevealed about me and a companion of mine about a well in which we sharedownership.'"<P><P><B>XI. Swearing by the might of Allah, His attributes and His words</B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, usedto say, 'I seek refuge by Your might.'"<P>Abu Hurayra reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, "A man will remain between the Garden and the Fire, and will say,'O Lord, turn my face away from the Fire!

Enough!' and its parts will adhere to one another."<P>Shu'ba related it from Qatada.<P><P><B>XII. The words of a man "By the life of Allah(<I>la-'amru'llah</I>)!"</B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "By your life! By Your living!"<P>6285.

The Prophet said, 'Act, and there is no wrong.'about all those matters on that day, He was not asked about anything butthat he said, 'Act, and there is no wrong.'"<P>[These questions were about the incorrect order of actions (sacrifice, shavingthe head and tawaf) in the hajj.]<P>6289.

He said, 'You must go back and pray for you have notprayed. The third time he said, 'Teach me.' He said, 'When you stand forthe prayer, do wudu' properly, then face the qibla and say the takbir andthen recite something you know well from the Qur'an and then do ruku' untilyou are at rest in your ruku'. Then stand back up until you are completelyupright. Then go into sajda until you are at rest in your sajda. Then sitback until you are at rest in the sitting position.

They said, 'Youprayed such-and-such.' The he did two prostrations with them and then said,'These two prostrations are for the person who does not know whether he hasadded to his pray or decreased it. He should seek what is correct and thencomplete what remains and then perform two prostrations.'"<P>6295. Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I said to Ibn 'Abbas, 'Ubayy ibn Ka'b relatedto us that he heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, say, "He [Musa] said.<I> 'Do not take me to task because I forgot.Do not demand of me something which is too difficult.' </I>(18:73)" He saidthat the first excuse used by Musa was forgetfulness.'"<P>6296. Ash-Sha'bi related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib had a guest and orderedhis family to slaughter before he returned so that their guest could eat.They slaughtered before the prayer and mentioned that to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace.

I owned a well on the land of a cousin of mine. I went to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said to me, 'Yourevidence or his oath.' I said, 'Then he will take an oath for it, Messengerof Allah.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Whoever swears a legal oath and swear a false oath by which he deprivesa Muslim of his property will meet Allah on the Day of Rising and find Himangry with him.'"<P><P><B>XVII.

Abu Burda reported that Abu Musa said, "My companions sent me to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to ask for some mounts.He said, 'By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride.' I happened tomeet him when he was angry. When I met him again, he said, 'Go to your companionsand say, 'Allah - or Allah's Messenger , may Allah bless him and grant himpeace - will give you mounts to ride.'"<P>6301.

(24:11-21) All of themare revealed about my innocence. Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, who used to providemaintenance for Mistah ibn Uthatha because he was related to him, said, 'ByAllah, I will never provide anything for Mistah ever again after what hesaid about A'isha!' So Allah revealed, <I>''Those of you possessing affluenceand ample wealth should not make oaths that they will not give to their relativesand the very poor ..." </I>Abu Bakr said, 'Yes, by Allah, I want Allah toforgive me.' So he restored to Mistah what he had been giving him. He said,'By Allah, I will never divest him of it!'"<P>6302. Zahdam said, "We were with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari when he said, "I cameto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, witha group of Ash'aris and happened to come to him when he was angry and askedhim to give us mounts and he swore that he would not give us something toride. Then he said, 'By Allah, Allah willing, I will never swear an oathand then see something better than it but that I will expiate it and do thatwhich is better (or do that which is better and expiate my oath.'"<P><P><B>XVIII. If someone says, "By Allah, I will not speak today" and then praysor recites Qur'an, says, "Glory be to Allah," 'Allah is greater," Praisebelongs to Allah," or "There is no god but Allah," he is according to hisintention.</B><P>The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "The best of wordsare four: "Glory be to Allah, Praise belongs to Allah, There is no god butAllah, and Allah is greater."<P>Abu Sufyan said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wroteto Heraclius. 'Come to a word which is common to you and us.."<P>Mujahid said, <I>"the word of taqwa" </I>(48:26) is "There is no god butAllah."<P>6303.

Glory be to Allah, the Immense."<P>6305. Shaqiq related that 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said something and then I said something.He said, 'Whoever dies while attributing an equal to Allah will be made toenter the Garden,' and I said, 'Whoever dies and does not attribute an equalto Allah will admitted to the Garden.'"<P><P><B>XIX.

When someone swears that he will not drink nabidh and then drinkstila', sakar or juice, some people say that he has not broken his oath, andthey do not consider these to be nabidh</B><P>[Nabidh is an effusion made with dried dates, raisins or the likes whichis drunk before it becomes intoxicating.

Anas ibn Malik related, "I heard the voice of the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it was weak and I recognisedhunger in it. Do you have anything?' She said, 'Yes,' and produced some barleyloaves. She took a scarf of hers and wrapped up the bread in part of it andthen she put it under my garment and tied the other end of it round me. Thenshe sent me to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and I took it with me. I found the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, sitting in the mosque with some people. I stoodover them and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Did Abu Talha send you?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'For a meal?' I said,'Yes.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Get up.' Then he set off and I went on ahead of them until I came to AbuTalha and informed him. Abu Talha said, 'Umm Sulaym! The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has come with some people, and wedo not have anything to feed them.' She said, 'Allah and His Messenger knowbest.' Abu Talha went to meet the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, went forward with him until they both entered and the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Bring what youhave, Umm Sulaym.' So she brought that bread and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded it to be broken up andthen Umm Sulaym squeezed some ghee on it to flavour it.' Then the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said what Allah willedover it and then he said, 'Admit ten,' and he admitted them. They ate untilthey were full and then went out. Then he said, 'Admit ten' and he admittedthem. They ate until they were full and then went out. Then he said, 'Admitten' and he admitted them and so on until all the people had eaten and werefull, and there were seventy or eighty men."<P><P><B>XXII. Intention in oaths</B><P>6311. 'Alqama ibn Waqqas al-Laythi said, "I heard 'Umar ibn al-Khattab say,'I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,say, "Actions are but judged according to intentions. Every man has whathe intends. So whoever emigrates to Prophet and His Messenger, his emigrationis to Allah and His Messenger. Whoever emigrates to gain something of thisworld or to marry a woman, his emigration is for that to which he emigrated."<P><P><B>XXIII. When someone gives away his property because of a vow orrepentance</B><P>6312. 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik, who was one of Ka'b ibn Malik's sonswho guided him when he went blind, said, "I heard Ka'b ibn Malik say in theend of his account about, 'to the three who remained behind,' 'Part of myrepentance was that I divested myself of my property as <I>sadaqa</I> forAllah and His Messenger. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Keep some of your property. That would be better for you."'"<P><P><B>XXIV. When someone declares food unlawful [for himself]</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"O Prophet! Why do you make unlawfuul whatAllah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah isEver-Forgiving, Most Merciful."</I> (66:1)<P>He says, <I>"Do not make unlawful the good things Allah has made lawful foryou." </I>(5:87)<P>6313. 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr was heard to say that 'A'isha stated, "The Prophet,&nbsp;may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to stay with Zaynab bintJahsh and drink honey with her. Hafsa and I decided that if he came to eitherof us, she would say to him, 'I smell <I>maghafir</I> on you. You have eaten<I>maghafir</I> (a sweet gum with a foul smell).' He came to one of us andshe said that to him. He said, 'No, rather I have drunk honey with Zaynabbint Jahsh. I will do not so again.'" It was revealed "<I>O Prophet! Whydo you make unlawfuul what Allah has made lawful for you</I>? ... to ..<I>"If the two of you would only turn to Allah." </I>(66:1-4) addressed to 'A'ishaand Hafsa. <I>"The Prophet confided a certain matter to one of his wives"</I>(66:3), which was his words, "I have drunk honey."<P>Hisham said, "I will not do so again, and I have sworn it. Do not tell anyoneabout that."<P><P><B>XXV. Fulfilling vows</B><P>His words, <I>"They fulfil their vows." </I>(76:7)<P>6314. Sa'id ibn al-Harith related that he heard Ibn 'Umar say, "Were theynot forbidden to make vows? The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'A vow does not advance or delay. By the vow, something is extractedfrom a miser.'"<P>6315. 'Abdullah ibn Murra related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade vows and said, 'It doesnot repel anything, and extracts something from the miser.'"<P>6316. Al-A'raj related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The vow does not bring the son of Adamanything not decreed for him, but his vow may meet the decree which has beendecreed for him. By it Allah extracts from the miser and he gives Me whathe would not give but for his vow.'"<P><P><B>XXVI. The wrong action of the one who does not fulfil a vow</B><P>6317. Zahdam ibn Mudarrib said, "I heard 'Imran ibn Husayn relate that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The best of youis my generation, and then those who follow them, and then those who followthem.' 'Imran said, 'I do not know whether he mentioned two or three afterhis generation.' [He continued,] 'Then will come a people who make vows butdo not fulfil them, who are treacherous and not trustworthy, who give testimonywhen they are not asked for it, and plumpness will appear among them.'"<P><P><B>XXVII. A vow in Allah's obedience</B><P><I>"Whatever amount you spend or vow you make, Allah knows it. The wrongdoershave no helpers." </I>(2:270)<P>6318. Al-Qasim related that 'A'isha said that the Prophet*, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Whoever vows to obey Allah, should obey Him.Whoever vows to disobey Him, should not disobey Him."<P><P><B>XXVIII. When someone vowed or swore that he would not speak to anyonein the Jahiliyya and then became Muslim</B><P>6319. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar said, "Messenger of Allah.in the Jahiliyya, I vowed to do <I>i'tikaf </I> in the Masjid al-Haram forone night.' He said, "Fulfil your vow."<P><P><B>XXIX. Someone who dies with an unfulfilled vow</B><P>Ibn 'Umar commanded a woman whose mother had died having made a vow to prayin Quba': "Pray on her behalf."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said the like of that.<P>6320. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas reported that Sa'd ibn 'Ubada al-Ansari askedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;for a fatwa abouta vow which his mother made but then had died before fulfilling it. He gavehim a verdict that he should fulfil it on her behalf. That became a sunnaafterwards.<P>6321. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A man came to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "My sister made a vowto go on hajj and died." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "If she owed a debt, would you have settled it?" He answered, "Yes."He said, "Then settle it with Allah. He more right to be paid off."<P><P><B>XXX. A vow about something one does not own and a vow to disobey Allah</B><P>6322. Al-Qasim related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Whoever vows to obey Allah, should obey Him.Whoever vows to disobey Him, should not disobey Him."<P>6323. Thabit related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "Allah has no need of this person torturing himself,"when he saw him walking between his two sons."<P>Another isnad from Thabit from Anas.<P>6324. Tawus related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, saw a man doing tawaf of the Ka'ba tied with a rein[by which someone was leading him] or something else and he cut that.<P>6325. Tawus related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, passed by a man who was doing tawaf of the Ka'ba whileanother person was leading him by a nose ring in his nose. The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, cut it with his own hand and then commandedhim to lead him by the hand.<P>6326. 'Ikrima related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "While the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was giving a speech, he saw a man who wasstanding and asked about him. They said, "Abu Isra'il. He vowed that he willstand and not sit, not seek shade nor speak and will fast." The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Command him to speak, seekshade and sit, but he should complete his fast."<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from 'Ikrima from the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace.<P><P><B>XXXI. Someone who vows to fast for some days which coincide with the 'Idan-Nahr or 'Id al-Fitr</B><P>6327. Hakim ibn Abi Hurra al-Aslami said that he heard 'Abdullah ibn 'Umarbeing asked about a man who made a vow that he would fast every day and thenthat coincided with<I> 'Id an-Nah</I>r or <I>'Id al-Fitr</I>. He said, "<I>'Youhave a good example in the Messenger of Allah.'</I> (33:21) He did not fastthe day of Adha or Fitr and did not think that they should be fasted." [Or'we do not think'.)<P>6328. Ziyad ibn Jubayr said, "I was with Ibn 'Umar when a man asked him,'I have vowed to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday as long as I live and thisday coincides with the <I>'Id an-Nahr</I>.' Ibn 'Umar said, 'Allah has commandedthat vows be fulfilled and we were forbidden to fast the Day of Nahr.' Theman repeated the question and he gave him a similar answer, adding nothingmore."<P><P><B>XXXII. Can land, sheep, agriculture and belongings be included in oathsand vows?</B><P>Ibn 'Umar said that 'Umar said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, "I have got a piece of land and I have never had a more valuablepiece of land." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"If you wish, you can make a habous of it and give [its proceeds ] as sadaqa."<P>Abu Talha said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Thedearest of my property is Bayruha'," a garden which he owned opposite themosque."<P>6329. the client of Ibn Muti' related that Abu Hurayra said, "We went outwith the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, onthe Day of Khaybar and did not take as booty either gold nor silver. We onlytook some property, clothing and goods. A man of the Banu'd-Dubayb calledRifa'a ibn Zayd, gave the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, a slave called Mid'am. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace,made for Wadi al-Qura In Wadi al-Qura while Mid'amwas removing the saddle of the Messenger of Allah, a stray arrow came andhit him and killed him. The people said, 'Welcome to the Garden for him!'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'No,by the One who has my soul in His hand, the cloak which he took from thebooty on the Day of Khaybar before the distribution has been kindled intofire on him.' When the people heard that, one man brought one or two strapsto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who said,''One - or two - straps of fire.'"<P><P><FONT COLOR="Maroon"><B><BIG><A NAME="expiation">Chapter 87. Book of theExpiation of Oaths</A></BIG></B></FONT><P><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"The expiation in that case is to feed tenpoor people." </I>(5:89)<P>What the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded whenit was revealed<I>, "The expiation is fasting or sadaqa or sacrifice."</I>(2:196)<P>It is mentioned from Ibn 'Abbas 'Ata' and 'Ikrima, "Whenever 'or' is usedin the Qur'an, then the person has a choice. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, gave Ka'b a choice in expiation.<P>6330. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Layla related that Ka'b ibn 'Ujra said, "I wentto him,' i.e. the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'andhe said, 'Come near,' so I went near and he asked, 'Are your lice troublingyou?' 'Yes,' I answered. He said, 'The fidya is fasting, sadaqa or offeringa sacrifice."<P>It is related that Ayyub said, "It is fasting three days, sacrificing a sheepor feeding six poor people."<P><P><B>I. When is expiation obliged for rich and poor?</B><P>The words of Allah, <I>"Allah has made the expiation of your oaths obligatoryfor you. Allah is your Master &#150; He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."</I>(66:2)<P>6331. Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I amdestroyed!' He asked, 'What is your case?' He said, 'I had sex with my wifein Ramadan!' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Can you free a slave?' 'No,' he answered. He asked, 'Can you fast two successivemonths?' 'No,' he answered. He asked, 'Can you feed sixty poor people?' 'No,'he answered. He said, 'Sit down,' and he sat down. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was brought a large basket of dates (<I>'Araq</I>is a large measure), and he said, 'Take this and give it as sadaqa.'He asked, 'To someone poorer than us?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, laughed until his molars showed and said, 'Feed it to yourfamily.'"<P><P><B>II. Someone who helps another person in difficulties to do <I>kaffara</I>(expiation)</B><P>6332. Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I amdestroyed!' He asked, 'Why is that?' He said, 'I had sex with my wife inRamadan!' He said, 'Can you manage a slave?' 'No,' he answered. He asked,'Can you fast two successive months?' 'No,' he answered. He asked, 'Can youfeed sixty poor people?' 'No,' he answered. A man of the Ansar brought alarge basket (an <I>'araq,</I> a measure) containing dates. He said, 'Takethis and give it as sadaqa.' He said, 'To someone in more need than us, Messengerof Allah? By the One who sent you with the Truth, there is no household betweenthe two lava-beds &nbsp;[i.e. in Madina] needier than we are.' Then he said,'Go and feed it to your family.'"<P><P><B>III. Feeding ten poor people for kaffara, relatives or non-relatives.</B><P>6333. Humayd related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man came to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I am destroyed!' He asked,'What is your case?' He said, 'I had sex with my wife in Ramadan!' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Can you manage a slave?''No,' he answered. He asked, 'Can you fast two successive months?' 'No,'he answered. He asked, 'Can you feed sixty poor people?' 'I do not have themeans,' he answered. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was brought a basket of dates and said, 'Take this and give it as sadaqa.'He said, 'To one poorer than us? There is no one between the two lava bedspoorer than us,' Then he said, 'Take it and feed it to your family.'"<P><P><B>IV. The <I>sa'</I> of Madina and the <I>mudd</I> of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and its blessing. What the people of Madinainherited of that generation after generation.</B><P>6334. Al-Ju'ayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid said,"The sa' in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was a mudd and two-thirds by your mudd today. It was increased in the timeof 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz."<P>6335. Malik related that Nafi' said, "Ibn 'Umar used to pay the zakat ofRamadan (zakat al-fitr) using the original mudd of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and he also used the mudd of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for expiating the oath.<P>Abu Qutayba said, "Malik said to us, 'Our mudd is larger than your mudd.We do not see any superiority except in the mudd of the Prophet.' Malik saidto me, 'If a ruler came to you and set a mudd smaller than the mudd of theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, what would you use to payit?' I answered, 'We would pay by the mudd of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. He said, 'Do you not see that the business revertsback to the mudd of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?'"<P>6336. Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Talha related from Anas ibn Malik that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'O Allah,bless them in their measure, their sa' and their mudd.'"<P><P><B>V. The words of the Almighty, <I>"or to free a slave"</I> (5:89) and whichslave is best</B><P>6337. Sa'id ibn Marjana related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone frees a Muslim slave, Allahwill free a limb of his body from the Fire for every evil limb of his, evenhis private parts for his private parts."<P><P><B>VI. Freeing a mudabbar, umm walad and mukatib for expiation. Freeing abastard.</B><P>Tawus said, "A mudabbar and umm walad satisfy that."<P>[A <I>mudabbar</I> is the slace who is to be set free when his master dies.A umm walad is a slavegirl who has born her master's child. She cannot besold and becomes free when he dies. A mukatib is a slave who has a contractto buy his freedom in instalments.]<P>6338. 'Amr related from Jabir that an Ansari man made a slave of his a<I>mudabbar</I> and he had no property except for the slave. The Prophetheard about that and said, 'Who will buy him for me?" Nu'aym ibn an-Nahhambought him for 300 dirhams."<P>I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, "It was a Coptic slave who died the sameyear."<P><P><B>VII. When someone frees a slave jointly owned with someone else</B><P><B>VIII. When someone frees a slave for expiation, who has the wala' of theslave?</B><P>[This means he or she becomes the heir of the freed slave in the absenceof those entitled to inherit.]<P>6339. Al-Aswad related that 'A'isha wanted to buy Barira and the ownersstipulated that they would have the wala'. She mentioned that to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, "Buy her. the wala'belongs to the one who sets free."<P><P><B>IX. Saying 'Allah willing' when making an oath</B><P>6340. Abu Burda ibn Abi Musa related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "I wentto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a group ofAsh'arites to ask him to give us mounts. He said, 'By Allah, I will not giveyou mounts and I do not have anything which you can ride,' Then we stayedthere as long as Allah wished us to stay and then three camels with whitehumps were brought to him and he had us ride them. When we left, we &#150;or some of us &#150; said, 'By Allah, we will have no blessing! We went tothe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to ask him for mountsand he swore that he would not give us mounts and then he gave us mounts.'"Abu Musa said, "We went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and mentioned that to him and he said, 'I did not give you mounts.Allah gave you mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, I will never swear an oathand then see something better than it but that I will do that which is betterand expiate my oath."<P>Hammad said, "But that I will expiate my oath and do that which is better,"or "I will do that which is better and expiate my oath."<P>6341. Tawus related that Abu Hurayra said, "Sulayman said, 'I will go aroundtonight to ninety wives and each woman will produce a warrior who will fightin the way of Allah.' His companion angel said to him, 'Say, "Allah willing."'He forgot and went around to them and none of them gave birth except a womanwho had half a boy." Abu Hurayra said, "If he had said, 'Allah willing,'he would not have broken his oath and would have achieved his need."<P>One he said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "If he had added the except (Allah willing)."<P>Al-A'raj related the like of the hadith from Abu Hurayra.<P><P><B>X. Expiation before and after breaking an oath</B><P>6342. It is related that Zahdam al-Jarmi said, "We were with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari,and there was friendship and mutual favours between us and this tribe ofJarm. He was brought some food which contained chicken meat. Among thosepresent was a man from the Banu Taym who was reddish as if he were one ofthe Greek clients. He did not approach the good and Abu Musa said to him,'Come over. I have seen the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, eating this.' He said, 'I saw them eating something filthy andI swore that I would never eat that.' Abu Musa said, 'Come over and I willinform you about that. We went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, in the group of the Ash'arites, asking him to giveus mounts. He was dividing up some of the livestock of the <I>zakat</I>.(Ayyub said, 'I think that he said that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was angry.') He said, 'By Allah, I will not give youmounts, and I do not have any mounts to give you.' We left and then the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought some camelsas booty. He said, 'Where are those Ash'arites?' He commanded for us fivecamels with white humps. When we left, I said to my companions, 'We wentto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to ask for mountsand He swore that he would not give us any mounts and then he sent for usgave us mounts. The Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we are take advantage of Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forgetting his oath, wewill never prosper! Let us go back to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and remind him of his oath.' So we returned to himand said, 'Messenger of Allah, we came to you and asked you to give us mountsand you swore that you would not give us mounts and then you gave us mounts.We thought (or we recognised?) that you forgot your oath.' He said, 'Go,Allah gave you mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, I will never make an oathand then see something better than it without doing the thing that is betterand then doing expiation for it.'"<P>Hammad ibn Zayd corroborate it from Ayyub from Abu Qilaba and al-Qasim ibn'Asim al-Kalbi.<P>Another isnad of this from Zahdam.<P>Another isnad from Zahdam.<P>6343. Al-Hasan related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Samura that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not ask forcommand. If you are given it without asking for it, you will be helped init. If you are given it after asking for it, you will be left to it. If youswear an oath and then see something better than it, then do what is betterand expiate your oath.'<P>Ashhal corroborates it from Ibn 'Awn.<P>Yunus, Simak ibn 'Atiyya, Simak ibn Harb, Humayd, Qatada, Mansur, Hishamand ar-Rabi' corroborated it.<P><P>  <HR><P ALIGN=Center><B><BIG><A HREF="bukhcont.html">Return to Contents</A></BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><BIG><B><A HREF="index.html">Return to Home Page</A></B></BIG><P><P><P><P><P></BODY></HTML>
