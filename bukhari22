<P>
<P>
<B>I: Preconditions which are permitted in Islam, provisions and contracts</B>
<P>
2564. It is related from Marwan and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama from the Companions
of the Messenger of Allah, "When Suhayl ibn 'Amr wrote the document on that
day, one of the preconditions which Suhayl ibn 'Amr stipulated from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was: "If anyone comes to you, even
if he has your <I>deen</I>, you will return him to us and not come between
us and him.' The believers disliked that and resented it. Suhayl refused
to accept anything but that, so the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, wrote it with him on that basis. On that day he returned Abu Jandal
to his father, Suhayl ibn 'Amr. Any man who came to him he returned in that
period, even if he was a Muslim. Believing women came as emigrants, and Umm
Kulthum bint 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt was one of those who came to them on that
day.She was a young girl. Her people came to ask the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, to return her to them, but he did not return her
to them since Allah had revealed about them, <I>'When believing women come
to you as emigrants, submit them to a test. Allah has best knowledge of their
faith. If you know they are believers, do not return them to the rejectors.They
are not lawful for the rejectors nor are the rejectors lawful for them.'
</I>(60:10)"
<P>
It is reported from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to examine them by this <I>ayat</I>, <I>"O
you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, submit them
to a test</I>. ... to ..<I>.Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful."</I> (60:10-12)
<P>
'A'isha said, "Whoever of them acknowledged this precondition, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would say to her, 'I have
taken a contract of allegiance from you.' These are the words he used to
say and, by Allah, he never touched the hand of a woman in the contract of
allegiance, and he only made the contract of allegiance with them by his
words."
<P>
2565. It is related that Jarir was heard to say, "I offered allegiance to
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he imposed
a condition on me: 'Give good counsel to every Muslim.'"
<P>
2566. It is related that Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I offered allegiance
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the
condition that I would perform the prayer, pay the <I>zakat</I>, and offer
sincere counsel to every Muslim."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: When palm-trees are sold after they have been pollinated</B>
<P>
2567. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone sells palm-trees
which have been pollinated, their fruits belong to the seller unless the
buyer makes a stipulation about their inclusion."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Preconditions in Sales</B>
<P>
2568. It is related that 'A'isha reported that Barira came to her to seek
her help in her freedom-contract (<I>kitaba</I>) and she had not paid any
of her <I>kitaba</I>. 'A'isha said to her, "Go back to your people. If they
like, I will pay off your <I>kitaba</I> for you and your <I>wala' </I>will
then belong to me. I will do that.' Barira mentioned that to her people,
but they rejected it. They said, "If she wishes to do it seeking a reward
for you, let her do it and yo<I>ur wala</I>' will belong to us." She mentioned
that to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said to her, "Buy her and set her free. The <I>wala'</I> belongs to
the one who sets free."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: When the seller makes a condition of having the use of the animal's
back to a certain place, that is permitted</B>
<P>
2569. It is related from Jabir that he was travelling on a camel of his which
had become tired. "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
passed and struck it and made supplication for it. Then it went in an
unparalleled manner. Then he said, 'Sell it for an <I>awqiyya</I>.' I said,
'No.' Then he said, 'Sell it for an <I>awqiyya</I>.' So I sold it to him
and I made a condition that it carry me to my family. When we reached Madina,
I brought him the camel and he paid me its price and then I left. He sent
after me, I will not take your camel. Take your camel, That is a gift for
you.'"
<P>
Jabir said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
let me use its back to ride back to Madina."
<P>
From Mughira, he said, "I sold it provided that I could use its back until
I reached Madina."
<P>
'Ata' and others have, "You have its back as far as Madina."
<P>
From Jabir, "The precondition of using its back to Madina."
<P>
From Jabir, "You have its back until you return."
<P>
From Jabir, "We let you use its back as far as Madina."
<P>
From Jabir, "Use it to reach your family."
<P>
From Jabir, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, bought
it for an <I>awqiyya</I>."
<P>
Zayd ibn Aslam corroborates it from Jabir. Ibn Jurayj said from 'Ata' and
others from Jabir, "Take it for four dinars." This is an awiqyya when the
dinar is reckoned is reckoned as ten dirhams. Mughira from ash-Sha'bi did
not make its price clear from Jabir, nor Ibn al-Munkadir and Abu'z-Zubayr
from Jabir.
<P>
From Jabir is, "An <I>awqiyya</I> of gold."
<P>
From Jabir is, "A hundred dirhams."
<P>
From Jabir, "He bought it on the road to Tabuk. I reckon that he said, 'For
four awqiyyas.'"
<P>
From Jabir, "He bought it for ten dinars."
<P>
The words of ash-Sha'bi about it being for an <I>awqiyya</I> is in most and
the precondition is more frequent and I consider it to be sounder." Abu 'Abdullah
said that.
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Preconditions in agreements</B>
<P>
2570. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Ansar said to the Prophet,
'Divide the date-palms between us and our brothers.' He said, 'No.' The Ansar
said, 'Look after them and we will share the fruits with you.' They [the
Muhajirun] said, 'We hear and obey.'"
<P>
2571. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave Khaybar to the Jews provided
that they work it and cultivate and [in return] they would have half of what
it produced."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Preconditions about the bride-price in the marriage contract</B>
<P>
'Umar said, "Rights are in accord with preconditions, and you have what you
stipulate."
<P>
Al-Miswar said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
mention an in-law of his and praised him as an in-law and said he was good.
He said, 'When he spoke to me, he spoke the truth to me. When he made me
a promise, he kept it to me.'"
<P>
2572. It is related that 'Uqba ibn 'Amir said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The most binding of the
preconditions which you should fulfil are those by which private parts &nbsp;are
made lawful."
<P>
[Meaning the preconditions stipulated in a marriage contract.]
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Preconditions in share-cropping</B>
<P>
2573. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij was heard to say, "Among the Ansar,
we did the most work in the fields. We used to rent the land. Sometimes that
land would produce and sometimes it would not produce, so we were forbidden
to do that, but not forbidden from [letting] it for silver."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Preconditions which are not permitted in marriage</B>
<P>
2574. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade townsmen selling on behalf of men
of the desert, and [said] 'Do not bid against each other, bidding to raise
the price. A man should not make a increase a bid to override the sale of
his brother nor make a marriage proposal overriding the proposal of his brother.
A woman should not ask for the divorce of her sister so that she can get
hold of what her sister possesses."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Preconditions which are not permitted in <I>hudud</I></B>
<P>
2575. It is related that Abu Hurayra and Zayd ibn Khalif al-Juhani said,
"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, I ask you by Allah, to judge for
me by the Book of Allah.' The other opponent, who had more understanding
than him, stood up and said, 'Yes, judge between us by the Book of Allah.
Give me permission to speak.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'Speak.' He said, 'My son works for this man and
committed fornication with his wife. I was told that my son must be stoned,
and so I ransomed my son with a hundred sheep and a slave-girl. Then I asked
the people of knowledge and they informed me, "Your son must receive a hundred
lashes and be exiled for a year and this woman must be stoned."' The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'My the One in whose
hand is my soul, I will judge between the two of you by the Book of Allah.
The slave-girl and sheep must be returned and your son must receive a hundred
lashes and be exiled for a year. Unays, go to the wife of this man and if
she confesses, stone her.'" He said, "He went to her and she confessed and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded
that she be stoned."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Conditions permitted in the <I>mukatab</I> if he agrees to be sold
provided that he will be set free</B>
<P>
2576. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Barira came to me while she was a
<I>mukataba</I> and said, 'Umm al-Mu'minin, buy me. My people are going to
sell me, and you can free me.'" She said, "Yes." Barira went on, "My people
will only sell me on the condition that they keep my <I>wala'.</I>" She said,
"I have no need of you." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
heard that - or it reached him - and he said, "What is the problem of Barira?"
He said, "Buy her and set her free and give them the condition they want."
She said, "I bought her and set her free and gave her people the condition
of her <I>wala'</I>." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "The <I>wala' </I>belongs to the one who sets free, even if a hundred
preconditions are made."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Preconditions in divorce</B>
<P>
Ibn al-Musayyab, al-Hasan and 'Ata' said, "If he mentions the divorce first
or afterwards, he must abide by the condition he made."
<P>
[i.e. When he says something like, "If you enter the house, you are divorced"
or "You are divorced if you enter the house."]
<P>
2577. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, forbade meeting caravans, a Muhajir selling on behalf
of a man of the desert, a woman making a precondition of the divorce of her
sister, a man overbidding the sale of his brother, and he forbade bidding
against one another to raise the price and also leaving animals unmilked
[for days to make it appear that the animal has a lot of milk]."
<P>
It was corroborated by Mu'adh and 'Abdu's-Samad from Shu'ba. Ghundar and
'Abdu'r-Rahman said, "It is prohibited (passive tense)." Adam said, "We were
forbidden." An-Nadr and Hajjaj ibn Minhal said, "He forbade."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Verbal preconditions with people</B>
<P>
2578. It is related that Ubayy ibn Ka'b said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Musa is the Messenger of Allah,'
and he mentioned the <I>hadith</I> and where [al-Khidr] said,<I> 'Did I not
say that you would not be able to bear with me?'</I> (18:72) The first thing
was by forgetfulness; the second time he made a precondition, and the third
time was deliberate. He said,<I> 'Do not take me to task because I forgot.
Do not demand of me something too difficult.'&nbsp;So they continued until
they met a youngster whom he killed. </I>... <I>So they continued </I>. .
<I>.They found a wall there about to fall down and he built it up.'
</I>(18:73-77)" Ibn 'Abbas recited it [in a <I>shadhdh</I> reading], "Before
them was a king."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Preconditions in the <I>wala'</I></B>
<P>
2579. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Barira came to me and said, 'My people
have given me a freedom-contract (<I>kitaba</I>) for nine <I>awqiyas</I>,
one <I>awqiya</I> per year. Can you help me?' She said, 'If your people like,
I will count it out for them (in full) and your <I>wala' </I>will then belong
to me. I will do that.' Barira went to her people, told them but they rejected
it. She came from them when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was sitting there. She said, 'I proposed that to them and
they refused unless they can keep the <I>wala'</I>.' The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was listening and 'A'isha told the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, all about it. He said, 'Take her
and make it conditional on receiving the <I>wala'</I>. The <I>wala' </I>belongs
to the one who sets free.' 'A'isha did that and then the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up among the people and praised
and glorified Allah and then said, 'Why is it that some men make conditions
which are not in the Book of Allah? Any condition which is not in the Book
of Allah is invalid even if it is stipulated a hundred times. The decision
of Allah is more binding and the condition of Allah is firmer. The <I>wala'
</I>belongs to the one who sets free.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: When a precondition is made in the sharecropping: "If I wish, I can
expel you"</B>
<P>
2580. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "When the people of Khaybar dislocated
the joints of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, 'Umar stood up to speak and said, 'The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, employed the
Jews of Khaybar over their property and said, "We confirm you as long as
Allah confirms you." 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar went out to his property there and
they attacked him in the night and dislocated its hands and feet. You have
no enemy there but them and they are our enemies and those we suspect. I
think that they should be expelled.' When 'Umar had decided on that, one
of the Banu Abu'l-Huqayq came and said, 'Amir al-Mu'minin! Will you expel
us when Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, confirmed us and
employed us over property and granted us that condition [of residing there]?'
'Umar said, 'Do you think that I have forgotten what the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said? "How will it be for you when
you are expelled from Khaybar and your she-camel will travel with you night
after night?"' He said, 'That was a little joke from Abu'l-Qasim.' He said,
'You lie, enemy of Allah!' So 'Umar expelled them and gave them the price
of the fruits they had in money, camels, and goods in the forms of camel
saddles and ropes, etc."
<P>
Another <I>isnad</I> from 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, in summary.
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Conditions in <I>jihad</I> and making peace with the people of war,
and writing down the conditions</B>
<P>
2581. It is related from al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and Marwan, the <I>hadith</I>
of each supporting the other's, who said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, set out at the time of al-Hudaybiyya. When
they had gone part of the way, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Khalid ibn al-Walid is at al-Ghamim with the vanguard of
the Quraysh cavalry, so go to the right.' By Allah, Khalid was not aware
of them until there was the dust of the army appeared. .Then he galloped
back to warn Quraysh. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
proceeded until he was at ath-Thaniyya from where they could go down to them
and then his camel knelt with him. The people said, 'Go! go!' It stayed put.
They said, 'Al-Qaswa' has become headstrong. Al-Qaswa' has become headstrong.'
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Al-Qaswa' is
not headstrong, and that is not her nature. But the One who held back the
Elephant has held her back. Then he said, 'By the One in whose hand is my
soul, if they ask for anything by which they show respect for the sacred
things of Allah, I will grant it to them.' Then he scolded the camel and
she got up."
<P>
He said, "He turned aside from them until he stopped at the furthest part
of al-Hudaybiyya at a pit containing a small amount of water. The people
kept taking small amounts from it, and they did not leave it until there
was none of it left. So the people complained of thirst to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He removed an arrow from
his quiver and then commanded that they put it in the pit. By Allah, it continued
to flow for them and quench their thirst until they left it. While they were
like that, Budayl ibn Warqa' al-Khuza'i arrived with a group of people from
Khuza'a. They were the confidents and advisors of the Messenger of Allah
from the people of Tihama. Budayl said, 'I left Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy and 'Amir
ibn Lu'ayy who have camped at the water-holes of al-Hudaybiyya. They have
are milk camels and camels with young with them. They will fight you and
bar you from the House.'
<P>
"'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'We did not come to fight anyone, but we came to perform <I>'umra</I>. War
has weakened Quraysh and caused them harm, so if they wish, I will conclude
a truce with them in which they will leave me and the people alone. If I
am victorious, then they can enter what people have entered if they so wish.
Or, if not, they will have had a respite from war. If they refuse, then,
by the One in whose hand my soul is, I will fight them for the sake of this
business of mine until I am killed. Let Allah carry out His command.' Budayl
said, 'I will convey to them what you say.'"
<P>
He said, "He went until he came to Quraysh and said, 'We have come to you
from this man and we have heard what he said. If you wish us to present it
to you, we will do so.' Their foolish ones said, 'We have no need for you
to inform us of anything!' Those of them with good sense said, 'Tell us what
you heard him say.' He said, 'I heard him say such-and-such, and such-and-such,'
and he recounted to them what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, had said. 'Urwa ibn Mas'ud got up and said, 'O people! Are you
not like a father [to me]?' They answered, 'Yes, indeed.' He said, 'Am I
not like a son [to you]?' They answerted, 'Yes indeed.' He said, 'Do you
suspect me at all?' They answerted, 'No.' He said, 'Do you not know that
I summoned for war the people of 'Ukaz, and when they refused me, I came
to you with my family and children and those who obeyed me?' They replied,
'Yes indeed.' He said, 'This man has offered you a sensible plan. Accept
it and let me go to him.' They said, 'Go to him.' He went to him and began
to speak to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said the like of what he had said
to Budayl. At that 'Urwa said, 'O Muhammad, do you mean to eradicate your
people? Have you heard of anyone of the Arabs who eradicated his people before
you? If the other happens, by Allah, I do not see notables here, but rather
I see a motley lot of people who will actually flee and desert you.' Abu
Bakr said to him, 'Suck al-Lat's nipples! Would we flee from him and desert
him!' He asked, 'Who is this?' They said, 'Abu Bakr.' He said, 'By the One
who has my soul in His hand, were it not for a favour I owe you and for which
I have not repaid you, I would have answered you back!'"
<P>
He said, "He began to talk to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and when he talked, he took hold of his beard. Al-Mughira ibn
Shu'ba was standing by the head of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, with a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever 'Urwa reached his
hand toward the beard of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
he would strike his hand with the hilt of the sword. He said to him, 'Keep
your hand away from the beard of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace!' 'Urwa lifted his head and asked, 'Who is this?'
They replied, 'Al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba.' He said, 'Treacherous one! Am I not
striving [to remedy] your treachery?' Al-Mughira had accompanied some people
in the <I>Jahiliyya</I> and he killed them and took their money. Then he
came [to Madina] and became Muslim. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'As for his Islam, I accept it. As for the money,
I will have nothing to do with it.'
<P>
"Then 'Urwa began to scan the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, with his eyes. He said, 'By Allah, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would not spit but that
it landed in the palm of one of their men and he would rub his hand and skin
with it. If he gave a command, they hastened to do it. When he did<I>
wudu'</I>, they would practically fight over his left-over <I>wudu' </I>water.
When they spoke, they lowered their voices in his presence and none of them
would fix his gaze on him out of respect for him.' 'Urwa returned to his
companions and said, 'O people! By Allah, I have visited kings, and I have
visited Caesar, Chosroes and the Negus, and by Allah, I have not seen a king
whose people respect him as the Companions of Muhammad respect Muhammad.
He would not spit but that it landed in the palm of one of their men and
he would rub his hand and skin with it. If he gave a command, they hastened
to do it. When he did <I>wudu'</I>, they would practically fight over his
left-over <I>wudu' </I>water. When they spoke, they lowered their voices
in his presence and none of them would fix his gaze on him out of respect
for him. By Allah, he He has offered you a sensible plan, so accept it.'
<P>
"A man of the Banu Kinana said, 'Let me go to him.' They said, 'Go to him.'
When he was in sight of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and his Companions, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'This is so-and-so. He is one of the people who have esteem
for sacrificial camels. Drive them in front of him.' They were driven in
front of him and the people met him saying the <I>talbiya</I>. When he saw
that, he said, 'Glory be to Allah! It is not proper to bar these people from
the House!' When he returned to his companions, he said, 'I have seen the
sacrificial camels which are garlanded and marked. I do not think that these
people should be barred from the House.'
<P>
"A man among them called Mikraz ibn Hafs caught up and said, 'Let me go to
him.' They said, 'Go to him.' When he was in sight of them, the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'This is Mikraz. He is a shameless
man.' He began to speak to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and while he was speaking to him, Suhayl ibn 'Amr arrived."
<P>
Ma'mar related from Ayyub from 'Ikrima, "When Suhayl ibn 'Amr came, the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Your business has become
easy for you.'" Ma'mar said that az-Zuhri said in his hadith, "Suhayl ibn
'Amr came and said, 'Write a document between us and you.' So the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, summoned the scribe and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'In the name of Allah, the
All-Merciful, the Most Mericful.' Suhayl said, 'By Allah, I do not know what
"the All-Merciful" is. Rather write, "In Your name, O Allah," as you used
to write.' The Muslims said, 'By Allah, we will only write, "In the name
of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful!"' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Write: 'In Your name, O Allah."' Then he
said, 'This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has agreed." Suhayl
said, 'By Allah, if we had known that you were the Messenger of Allah, we
would not have barred you from the House nor fought you. Rather write: "Muhammad
son of 'Abdullah."' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'By Allah, I am the Messenger of Allah, even if you deny
me. Write: "Muhammad son of 'Abdullah."''
<P>
Az-Zuhri said, "That is because of his words, 'If they ask for anything by
which they show respect for the sacred things of Allah, I will grant it to
them.'"
<P>
"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, "On condition
that you let us go to the House and do <I>tawaf</I> of it.' Suhayl said,
'By Allah, the Arabs will not say of us that we were forced to submit. Rather
that will that place in the coming year.' So he wrote. Suhayl said, 'On the
condition that if any of our men comes to you, even if he has your religion,
you will return him to us.' The Muslims said, 'Glory be to Allah! How can
someone who has come as a Muslim be returned to the idolaters!' At that moment
Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl ibn 'Amr arrived dragging his chains, having left the
bottom part of Makka. He then threw himself down in the midst of the Muslims.
Suhayl said, 'This, O Muhammad, is the first term of the agreement with you
- that you return him to me.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'We have not finished the document yet.' He said, 'By Allah,
I will not make peace with you on any conditions ever!' The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Endorse it for me.' He said,
'I will not endorse it for you.' He said, 'Do it.' He said, 'I will not do
it.' Mikraz said, 'We endorse it for you.' Abu Jandal said, 'O company of
Muslims! Am I to be returned to the idolaters when I have come as a Muslim!
Do you not see what I have suffered?' He had been severely tortured for Allah."
<P>
He said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, 'I went to the Prophet of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Are you not truly the Prophet
of Allah?' He replied, 'Yes indeed.' I said, Do we not have the truth while
our enemy have the false?' He answered, 'Yes indeed.' I said, 'Then why do
we concede humbleness in our <I>deen</I>?' He said, 'I am the Messenger of
Allah and I do not disobey Him. He will make me victorious.' I asked, 'Did
you not tell us that we would go to the House and do <I>tawaf</I> of it?'
He said, 'Yes, but did I inform you that we would go to it this year?'" 'I
said, 'No.' He said, 'You will go to it and do <I>tawaf</I> of it.'"
<P>
'Umar said, "I went to Abu Bakr and said, 'O Abu Bakr! Is this one not truly
the Prophet of Allah?' He replied, 'Certainly.' I asked, 'Do we not have
the truth while our enemy has the false?' He replied, 'Yes indeed.' I said,
'Then why do we concede humbleness in our <I>deen</I>?' He said, 'O man!
He is the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
does not disobey his Lord and He will help him to victory. Hold to his command.
By Allah, he is based on the truth' I said, 'Did he not tell us that we would
go to the House and do <I>tawaf</I> of it?' He said, 'Yes, but did he inform
you that we would go to it this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'You will go
to it and do <I>tawaf</I> of it.'"
<P>
Az-Zuhri said, "'Umar said, 'I did many good deeds to make up for that.'
<P>
He said, "When the agreeing on the document was finished, the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to his Companions, 'Get
up and sacrifice and then shave your heads.'" He said, "By Allah, not a man
of them got up until he had said that three times. When none of them got
up, he went to Umm Salama and mentioned to her what he had encountered from
the people. Umm Salama said, 'O Prophet of Allah, do you want that done?
Then go out without saying a word to anyone until you have sacrificed your
camels and then summon your barber and have him shave your head.' So he went
out without speaking to anyone until he had done that. He sacrificed his
camels and summoned his barber who shaved his head. When they saw that, they
got up and slaughtered their camels and shaved one another's heads so that
they were practically fighting one out of sorrow. Then some believing women
came to him, and Allah Almighty sent down: '<I>O you who believe! When believing
women come to you as emigrants, submit them to a test</I>- to -<I> Do not
hold to any marriage ties with women who reject." </I>(60:10) On that day
'Umar divorced two wives of his who were idolaters. Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan
married one of them and Safwan ibn Umayya married the other.
<P>
"When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, returned
to Madina. Abu Basir, a man of Quryash who was a Muslim, came to him. They
(the Makkans] sent two men to fetch him and they said, 'In accordance with
the treaty which you have given us.' So he handed him over to the two men.
They took him as far as Dhu'l-Hulayfa and there they stopped to eat some
dates which they had. Abu Basir said to one of the two men, 'By Allah, O
so-and-so, I see that this sword of yours is excellent!' The other unsheathed
it and said, 'Yes indeed. By Allah, it is excellent! I have tested it and
tested it again.' Abu Basir said, 'Let me have a look at it.' So he gave
it to him, and Abu Basir struck him until he was stone dead. The other man
fled until he reached Madina and entered the mosque running. When the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw him, he said, 'I see
this man is terrified.' When he reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, he said, 'By Allah, he has killed my companion, and
would have killed me as well!' Abu Basir came and said, 'Prophet of Allah,
by Allah, Allah has let you fulfil your agreement. You returned me to them.
Then Allah saved me from them.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Woe to his mother! What a war-sparker if only he had
supporters!' When [Abu Basir] heard that, he knew that he would return him
to them again, so he went out until he came the coast of the sea."
<P>
He said, "Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl got free of them and joined Abu Basir. Whenever
a man of Quraysh became Muslim, he would only go out and join Abu Basir until
there were a band of them together. By Allah, whenever they heard about a
caravan belonging to Quraysh leaving for Syria, they would stop it and kill
them and take their property. So Quraysh sent to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace,&nbsp;entreating him by Allah and kinship to send
word [to Abu Basir] and that whoever came to him [the Prophet] would be safe.
So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent word to them
and Allah Almighty sent down, <I>'It is He who held their hands back from
you, and your hands from them in the valley of Makka, after giving you the
upper hand over them. Allah sees what you do... </I>to ... <I>the fanatical
rage of the Days of Ignorance .' </I>(48:24-26) Their fanatical rage was
that they did not affirm that he was the Prophet of Allah and did not affirm,
'In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful,' and came between
them and the House."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "<I>Ma'arra</I> is the cause of the scabies,
<I>tazayyalu</I> means "to distinguish". The zeal of people is making protection
inviolable. 'I defended the protected place so that it would not be entered.'"
<P>
2582. It is reported from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to test the women. It also reached us
that when Allah Almighty sent down that they should return to the idolaters
what they had spent on those of their wives who had emigrated and judged
that the Muslims should not keep the guardianship of unbelieving women, 'Umar
divorced two wives, Qurayba bint Abi Umayya and the daughter of Jarwal
al-Khuza'i. Mu'awiya married Qurayba and Abu Jahm married the other woman.
When the unbelievers refused to agree to pay what the Muslims had spent on
their wives, Allah Almighty sent down<I>, "If any of your wives rejoin the
rejectors, you should have compensation. So repay to those whose wives have
gone the dowry they paid out." </I>(60:11) <I>'Aqb </I>is what the Muslims
paid [of dowry] to the unbeliever whose wife had emigrated. He commanded
that a Muslim whose wife had departed be paid what he had spent out of the
dowry of the wives of the unbelievers who had emigrated. We do not know of
any of the women who emigrated who apostasised after she had believed.
<P>
It reached us that Abu Bakr ibn Asid ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a
believing emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas ibn Shariq wrote to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asking him for Abu Basir - and he
mentioned the <I>hadith</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Preconditions in loans</B>
<P>
2583. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, mentioned a man who had asked one of the tribe
of Israel to lend him a thousand dinars and he gave it to him for a specified
term."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar and 'Ata' said, "It is permitted to stipulate a specific term in
a loan."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: The <I>Mukatab</I>, and preconditions which are contrary to the
Book of Allah are not lawful</B>
<P>
Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said that there can be preconditions mutually agreed
between them in the <I>muktatab</I>.
<P>
Ibn 'Umar or 'Umar said, "Every precondition which is contrary to the Book
of Allah is invalid, even if a hundred such preconditions are made."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "It is said that &nbsp;it is reported from both of them:
'Umar and Ibn 'Umar."
<P>
2584. It is related that 'A'isha said that Barira came to her to ask her
for help in her <I>kitaba</I>. She said, "If you like, I will pay your people
and the <I>wala'</I> will be mine." When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came, she mentioned that and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Buy her and set her free.
The <I>wala' </I>belongs to the one who sets free." Then the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up on the minbar and
said, "Why is it that some men make conditions which are not in the Book
of Allah? Any condition which is not in the Book of Allah is invalid even
if it is stipulated a hundred times."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Preconditions which are permitted and exemptions made in the
settlement. Preconditions which are common between people. When someone says,
"A hundred less one or two."</B>
<P>
Ibn Sirin said that a man said to his hirer, "Prepare your riding animal.
If I do not travel with you on such-and-such a day, then you will have a
hundred dirhams." He did not leave. Shurayh said, "If someone imposes a condition
on himself of his own free well without being forced, it remains binding
on him."
<P>
Ayyub reported from Ibn Sirin that a man sold some food and the buyer said,
"If I do not come to you on Wednesday, there is no sale between you and me."
The buyer did not come, so Shurayh said to the buyer, "You have broken your
promise," and gave judgement against him.
<P>
2585. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah has ninety-nine names, a hundred
less one. Whoever knows them all will enter the Garden."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Preconditions in the <I>waqfs</I></B>
<P>
2586. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab got some land
in Khaybar and he went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, to ask for his advice about it. He said, "O Messenger of Allah, I
have got some land in Khaybar, and I have got no property more precious to
me than it. What do you command about it?" He said, "If you wish, you can
make its capital a <I>waqf</I> and you can give its proceeds as
<I>sadaqa</I>." He said, "'Umar gave it as <I>sadaqa</I> provided that it
would not be sold or given away or inherited. Its proceeds would begiven
in <I>sadaqa</I> to the poor, relatives, freeing slaves, in the Way of Allah,
for travellers, and guests. The trustee does nothing wrong if he consumes
some of it in a correct and reasonable manner and feeds people without storing
up."
<P>
He said, "Ibn Sirin related it and said that &nbsp;with the expression, 'without
amassing wealth'."

<P>
<P>
<B>I: Wills and the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, "The written will of a man should be with him." </B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "It is prescribed for you, when death approaches
one of you and if he has some goods to leave, to make a will in favour of
his parents and relatives, correctly and fairly: a duty for all godfearing
people. Then if anyone alters it after hearing it, the crime is on the part
of those who alter it. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. But if someone
fears bias or wrongdoing on the part of the person making the will, and puts
things right between the people involved, in that case he has not committed
any crime. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </I>(2:180-182)
<I>Janaf</I> means partiality. <I>Mutaj&acirc;nif</I> (5:3) means partial.
<P>
2587. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "It is not right for a Muslim
man who has anything to bequeath to spend two nights with having a written
will in his possession."
<P>
Muhammad ibn Muslim corroborated it from 'Amr from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
2588. It is related from 'Amr ibn al-Harith, the brother-in-law of the Messenger
of Allah, the brother of Juwayriyya bint al-Harith, "When the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, he left neither dirham
nor dinar nor slave nor slavegirl nor anything other than his white mule
which he used to ride, his weapons, and some land that he made <I>sadaqa</I>
for travellers."
<P>
2589. It is related from Talha ibn Musarrif, "I asked 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa
whether the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made a will.
He said, 'No.' I said, 'So how was the will prescribed for people (or were
they prescribed to make the will)?' He said, 'He bequeathed the Book of Allah.'"
<P>
2590. It is related from al-Aswad that it was mentioned in the presence of
'A'isha that 'Ali was appointed by will. She said, "When did he appoint him?
He was resting against my chest (or she said, "in my lap") and called for
a basin and then he went limp in my lap and I was not aware that he had died,
so when did he appoint him?"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: It is better to leave one heirs wealthy than to make them beg from
people</B>
<P>
2591. It is related that Sa'd ibn Abu Waqqas said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came to visit me when I was ill in Makka -
(and he did not like to die in the land from which he had emigrated) - and
said he said, 'May Allah have mercy on Ibn 'Afra'.' I said, 'Messenger of
Allah, can I will away all my property?' He said, 'No.' I asked, 'A half?'
'No,' he answered. I said, 'A third?' He said, 'A third, but a third is a
lot. It is better to leave your heirs wealthy than to make them beg from
people with their hands. Whatever you spend on maintenance is <I>sadaqa</I>,
even the morsel you put in your wife's mouth. Perhaps Allah may lengthen
your life so that some people benefit by you and others are harmed by you."
At that time he only had one daughter.
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Willing away a third</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "It is only permitted to will away a third."
<P>
Allah Almighty says, <I>"So judge between them by what Allah has sent down."
</I>(5:49)
<P>
2592. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "People should reduce it to a fourth
because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'A third, and a third is a lot - or substantial.'"
<P>
2593. It is related that Sa'd said, "The Prophet visited me when I was will.
I said, 'Messenger of Allah, ask Allah not to make me die in the land I left.'
He said, 'Perhaps Allah will lengthen your life and benefit some people through
you.' I said, 'I want to make a will and I only have a daughter.' I asked,
'Shall I will away a half?' He said, 'A half is too much.' I said, 'A third,
and a third is a lot - or substantial.'" He said, "People used to will away
a third as they were permitted to do that."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The one making the will saying to his executor, "Look after my son,"
and what the executor is permitted to claim</B>
<P>
2594. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "'Utba ibn
Abi Waqqas had made his brother, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas give an undertaking,
saying, 'The son of the slavegirl of Zam'a is mine, so take him with you.'
In the year of the Conquest, Sa'd took him and said, 'My brother's son who
gave me an undertaking about him.' 'Abd ibn Zam'a got up and said, 'My brother
and the son of my father's slavegirl. He was born on his bed.' They took
the case to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and Sa'd said, 'Messenger of Allah, my brother. He gave me an undertaking
about him.' 'Abd ibn Zam'a said, 'My brother and the son of my father's
slavegirl.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'He is yours, 'Abd ibn Zam'a. The child belongs to the bed and stones
belong to the adulterer.' Then he told Sawda bint Zam'a, 'Veil yourself from
him,' since he saw that he resembled 'Utba. He did not see her until he died."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: When the sick person makes a clear indication with his head, that is
permitted</B>
<P>
2595. It is related from Anas that a Jew crushed the head a girl between
two stones and she was asked, "Who did this to do? So-and-so? So-and-so?"
until the Jew was named. She made a gesture with her. He was brought and
kept until he confessed and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, ordered that his head be crushed with stones.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: No bequest to an heir</B>
<P>
2596. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "It used to be that property belongs
to the child and the parents only inherited through a will, and then Allah
abrogated what He willed of that and assigned the male the portion of two
females and assigned each of the parents a sixth and appointed for the wife
an eighth and a fourth, and for the husband a half and a fourth."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: <I>Sadaqa</I> at the time of death</B>
<P>
2597. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man asked the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Messenger of Allah, which <I>sadaqa</I>
is best?' He replied, 'That you give <I>sadaqa</I> while you are healthy
yet covetous, in fear of poverty and desiring wealth. Do not put it off until
death is near and you say, "So-and-so should have this much and so-and-so
this much,"' when it already belongs to someone else."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"after any bequest you make or any
debts"</I> (4:11)</B>
<P>
It is mentioned that Shurayh, 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, Tawus, 'Ata', and
Ibn Udhayna permitted a sick person to acknowledge a debt.
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "The truest <I>sadaqa</I> that a man gives is that on the
last day of [his life in] this world and the first day of the Next world."
<P>
Ibrahim and al-Hakam said, "If he absolves an heir from a debt, he is absolved."
<P>
Rafi' ibn Khudayj left a will that his wife, al-Fazariyya, should not have
removed those things on which her door had closed [i.e. the contents of her
house belonged to her.]
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "When someone is dying and tells his slave, 'You are free,'
that is valid."
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi said, "When the woman says when she is dying, 'My husband has
paid me [what he owed me] and I have received it," that acknowledge is valid.
Some people* say, 'The affirmation of a dying person is not permitted because
the heirs might suspect it. Then they employ <I>istihsan**</I> and say, 'It
is permitted for him to affirm trusts, goods, and partnership.' The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Beware of suspicion. Suspicion
is the falsest form of speech.'"
<P>
[<FONT COLOR="Navy">*i.e. Abu Hanifa and his peoples.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Navy">** <I>istihsan</I>: juristic preference, setting aside
the result of analogy for something considered better.</FONT>]
<P>
The property of Muslims is not lawful [to other than the owner] by the words
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "The sign of the
hypocrisy is that when you give him a trust, he betrays it." Allah Almighty
says, <I>"Allah commands you to return to their owners the things you hold
on trust ." </I>(4:58) He did not specify an heir or anyone else. This
<I>hadith</I> contains 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr reporting from the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
2598. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There are three signs of a hypocrite: whenever
he speaks, he lies; whenever he is trusted, he betrays his trust; and whenever
he makes a promise, he breaks it."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Interpretation of the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"after any bequest
you make or any debts"</I> (4:11)</B>
<P>
It is mentioned that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
settled debts before bequests.
<P>
His words, <I>"Allah commands you to return to their owners the things you
hold on trust ." </I>(4:58)
<P>
It returning trusts takes prioriry over voluntary bequests. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no <I>sadaqa</I>
except from someone who is wealthy."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "The slave cannot make a bequest without his owner's permission.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'A slave is a
shepherd of his master's property.'"
<P>
2599. It is related that Hakim ibn Hizam said, "I asked the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he gave to me, and then
I asked him and then he gave to me. Then he said to me, 'O Hakim, this wealth
is green and sweet. Whoever takes it with a generous soul will be blessed
in it. Whoever takes it with avarice is not blessed in it. He is like the
one who eats and is not filled. The upper hand is better than the lower hand.'"
Hakim said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, by the One who sent you with the
truth, I will never take anything from anyone after you until I leave this
world!' Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him the stipend but he refused
to take any of it. Then 'Umar summoned him to give it to him but he refused
to take it. He said, 'O company of Muslims! I offered him his due which Allah
has allotted him from this booty and he refuses to take it.'" Hakim did not
take anything from the people after the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, until he died, may Allah have mercy on him.
<P>
2600. It is related from Ibn 'Umar who said that he heard the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "All of you are shepherds.
Each of you is responsible for his flock. An imam is a shepherd and is
responsible for his flock. A man is a shepherd in respect of his family and
is responsible for his flock. A woman is a shepherd in respect of her husband's
house and is responsible for her flock. A servant is a shepherd in respect
of his master's property and is responsible for his flock." He said, "I think
that he said, "A man is a shepherd in respect of his father's property."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: When someone makes a <I>waqf</I> or bequest for his relatives, and
who constitutes the relatives</B>
<P>
Thabit reported from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said to Abu Talha, "Assign it to your poor relatives," and he
assigned it to Hassan and Ubayy ibn Ka'b.
<P>
From Anas in a similar <I>hadith</I> to that of Thabit it is reported that
he said, "Assign it to your poor kin." Anas said, "He assigned it to Hassan
and Ubayy ibn Ka'b, who were closer to him than me. The kinship of Hassan
and Ubayy to Abu Talha was that his name was Zayd ibn Sahl ibn al-Aswad ibn
Haram ibn 'Amr ibn Zayd Manat ibn 'Adi ibn 'Amr ibn Malik ibn an-Najjar,
and Hassan was the son of Thabit ibn al-Mundhir ibn Haram, and so they both
have Haram, who is the grandfather. Haram was the son of 'Amr ibn Zayd Manat
ibn 'Adi ibn 'Amr ibn Malik ibn an-Najjar, so Hassan, Abu Talha and Ubayy
are joined in the sixth ancestor to 'Amr ibn Malik, who is Ubayy ibn Ka'b
ibn Qays ibn 'Ubayd ibn Zayd ibn Mu'awiya ibn 'Amr ibn Malik ibn an-Najjar.
So 'Amr ibn Malik is an ancestor of both Hassan, Abu Talha and Ubayy.
<P>
One of them* said, "If he makes a bequest on behalf of his kin, they must
go back to a common Muslim ancestor."
<P>
[*Abu Yusuf]
<P>
2601. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said to Abu Talha, "I think that you should assign it to your
relatives." Abu Talha said, "I will do it, Messenger of Allah," and Abu Talha
divided it between his relatives and cousins."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the <I>ayat </I>was sent down, <I>'Warn your near
relatives,"</I> (26:214) the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
began to call, "O Banu Fihr! O Banu 'Adi!' to the subtribes of Quraysh.
<P>
Abu Hurayra said, "When '<I>Warn your near relatives</I>', was sent down,
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'O company of
Quraysh!'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Are women and children included among relatives?</B>
<P>
2602. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "When Allah, the Mighty and Exalted,
sent down '<I>Warn your near relatives</I>', the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up and said, 'O company of Quraysh!
(or words to that effect) Purchase your selves! I cannot help you against
Allah in any way. O Banu 'Abd Manaf! I cannot help you against Allah in any
way. O 'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib! I cannot help you against Allah in any
way. O Safiyya, aunt of the Messenger of Allah! I cannot help you against
Allah in any way. O Fatima daughter of Muhammad! Ask me what you wish of
my property, but I cannot help you against Allah in any way.'"
<P>
Asbagh corroborated it from Ibn Wahb from Yunus from Ibn Shihab.
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Can the one who sets up a <I>waqf</I> benefit from his
<I>waqf</I>?</B>
<P>
'Umar stipulated that there is no harm in its trustee eating from it. The
founder of the <I>waqf</I> or someone else can act as its trustee. It is
like that with someone who designates sacrificial camels or something else
for Allah - he can use it as others use it, even if he had not stipulated
that.
<P>
2603. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, saw a man driving a sacrificial camel and said, "Ride it." He
said, "Messenger of Allah, it is a sacrificial camel." He said on the third
or fourth time, "Ride it, confound you (or bother you).
<P>
2604. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, saw a man driving a sacrificial camel and said, "Ride
it." He said, "Messenger of Allah, it is a sacrificial camel." He said, "Ride
it, confound you" the second or third time.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: When someone makes a <I>waqf</I> of something before he has given
to someone else, that is permitted</B>
<P>
That is because 'Umar created a <I>waqf</I> and said, "There is no objection
if its trustee eats," and he did not specify whether its trustee was 'Umar
or someone else.
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Abu Talha,
"I think you should assign it for relatives," and he said, "I will do it"
and divided it between his relatives and cousins.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: When he says, "My house is <I>sadaqa</I> for Allah" and does not
specify that it is for the poor or others, that is permitted, and it is placed
with the relatives, or however he likes</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Abu Talha when
he said, "The property I love the most is Bayraha' and it is <I>sadaqa</I>
for Allah." So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, permitted
that.
<P>
One of them* said, "It is not permitted until he makes it clear whom it is
for," but the first is sounder.
<P>
[*ash-Shafi'i]
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: When he says, "My land - or my garden - is <I>sadaqa</I> on behalf
of my mother," it is permitted, even if he does not specify the beneficiary</B>
<P>
<P>
2605. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the mother of Sa'd ibn 'Ubada died
in his absence. He said, "Messenger of Allah, my mother has died in my absence.
Will it help her at all if I give <I>sadaqa</I> on her behalf?" He said,
"Yes." He said, "Then I testify that my two gardens of al-Mikhraf are
<I>sadaqa</I> for her."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: When someone gives <I>sadaqa</I> or makes a <I>waqf</I> of part of
his property, or part of his slaves, or his animals, that is permitted</B>
<P>
2606. It is related that Ka'b ibn Malik was heard to say, "I said, 'Messenger
of Allah, part of my repentance is that I give all my property as
<I>sadaqa</I> to Allah and to His Messenger.' He said, 'Keep part of your
property. That is better for you.' I said, 'I will keep my share at Khaybar."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: The one who gives <I>sadaqa</I> to his guardian and then his guardian
returns it to him</B>
<P>
2607. It is related that Anas said, "When it was sent down, <I>'You will
not attain true goodness until you give of what you love,'</I> (3:92) Abu
Talha came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allah, may He be blessed and exalted! says
in His Book, "<I>You will not attain true goodness until you give of what
you love</I>." The property I love the best is Bayruha.'" He said, "It was
a garden, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to enter it and enjoy its shade drink its water. He said, 'It is
<I>sadaqa</I> for Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, and His Messenger. I hope
for its goodness and I hope that it will be stored up for me. Messenger of
Allah, dispose of it in whatever way Allah shows you is best.' The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Excellent, Abu
Talha! That is a profitable property. We accept it from you and return it
to you. Designate it for your relatives." Abu Talha gave it as <I>sadaqa</I>
to his relatives." He said, "They included Ubayy and Hassan." He said, "Hassan
sold his share of it to Mu'awiya. It was said to him, 'Do you sell the
<I>sadaqa</I> of Abu Talha?' He replied, 'Why should I not sell a<I> sa'
</I>of dates for a <I>sa' </I>of dirhams?'" He said, "That garden was in
the location of the fortress of the Banu Hudayla which Mu'awiya built."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"If other relatives or orphans
or poor people attend the sharing-out, provide for them out of it.</I>"
(4:8)</B>
<P>
2608. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Some people claim that this
<I>ayat</I> was abrogated. No, by Allah, it was not abrogated, but it is
part of what people attach little importance to. There are two guardians:
there is the guardian who inherits, and that is the one who provides [for
them], and there is the guardian who does not inherit. That is the one who
should speak kindly and say, 'I do not own it so that I can give to you.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: It is recommended to give <I>sadaqa</I> on behalf of someone who
dies suddenly and to carry out the vows of the deceased</B>
<P>
2609. It is related from 'A'isha that a man said to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, "My mother died suddenly and I thought that
if she had spoken, she would have given <I>sadaqa</I>. Shall I give
<I>sadaqa</I> for her?" He said, "Yes, give sadaqa for her."
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#v1">2610.</A> It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that Sa'd
ibn 'Ubada asked for the decision of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, saying, "My mother died having made a vow." He said,
"Carry it out for her."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: Witnesses in a <I>waqf</I> and <I>sadaqa</I></B>
<P>
2611. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the mother of Sa'd ibn 'Ubada, the
brother of the Banu Sa'ida, died in his absence. He went to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger of Allah, my
mother has died in my absence. Will it help her at all if I give
<I>sadaqa</I> on her behalf?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Then I testify that
my two gardens of al-Mikhraf are <I>sadaqa</I> for her."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: The words of Allah Almighty:</B>
<P>
<I>"Give orphans their property, and do not substitute bad things for good.
Do not assimilate their property into your own. Doing that is a serious crime.
If you are afraid of not behaving justly towards orphans, then marry other
permissible women." </I>(4:2-3)
<P>
2612. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr asked 'A'isha about, "<I>If
you are afraid of not behaving justly towards orphans, then marry other
permissible women</I>," and she said, "It is the orphan girl in the care
of her guardian. He desires her beauty and property and wants to marry her
for less than the custom of women like her. They were forbidden to marry
them until they were just to them in giving them their full dowry. [Otherwise,]
they were commanded to marry women besides them."
<P>
'A'isha said, "Then after that people asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, for a statement and Allah, the Mighty and
Exalted, sent down, <I>'They will ask you for a definitive ruling about women.
Say, "Allah gives you a definitive ruling about them."' </I>(4:127)" She
said, "Allah made it clear in this <I>ayat</I> that if the orphan girl has
beauty and wealth, they would desire to marry her and not give her the full
amount of dowry according to her custom. If she is not desirable as she has
little beauty and money, they would leave her and seek other women. He said,
'As they left her when they did not desire her, so they cannot marry her
when they desire her unless they are just to him by paying her the full dowry
and giving her her due.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: The words of Allah Almighty, "Keep a close check on orphans until
they reach a marriageable age, then if you perceive that they have sound
judgement hand over their property to them. Do not consume it extravagantly
and precipitately before they come of age. Those who are wealthy should abstain
from it altogether. Those who are poor should use it sensibly and correctly.
When you hand over their property to them ensure that there are witnesses
on their behalf. Allah is enough as a Reckoner. Men receive a share of what
their parents and relatives leave and women receive a share of what their
parents and relatives leave, a fixed share, no matter whether it is a little
or a lot." (4:6-7)</B>
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: What the executor can do with the orphan's property and what he
can consume from it according to his work</B>
<P>
2613. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar gave as <I>sadaqa</I> some
property that he had in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. It was called Thamgh and consisted of date-palms.
'Umar said, "O Messenger of Allah, I have obtained some property, and it
is precious to me. I want to give it as <I>sadaqa</I>." The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Give its capital as <I>sadaqa</I>
provided that it would not be sold or given away or inherited. Its proceeds
should be spent.' So 'Umar gave it as <I>sadaqa</I> and that <I>sadaqa</I>
was in the way of Allah for freeing slaves, the poor, guests, travellers,
and relatives. There nothing wrong if its trustee consumes some of it in
a correct and reasonable manner or feeds his friend without storing up.'"
<P>
2614. It is related that 'A'isha said that <I>"Those who are wealthy should
abstain from it altogether. Those who are poor should use it sensibly and
correctly" </I>was sent down about the guardian of the orphan that if he
were needly, he could take from the property according to his financial situation
in a reasonable manner.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"People who consume the property
of orphans wrongfullyconsume nothing in their bellies except fire. They will
roast in a Searing Blaze." </I>(4:10)</B>
<P>
2615. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Avoid the seven fatal sins." They asked, "Messenger
of Allah, what are they?" He answered, "Associating with Allah, sorcery,
killing a soul which Allah has forbidden except by legal right, consuming
usury, consuming the property of an orphan, fleeing on the day of battle
and slandering unthinking chaste believing women."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: The words of Allah Almighty:</B>
<P>
<I>"They will ask you about the property of orphans. Say, 'Managing it in
their best interests is best.' If you mix your property with theirs, they
are your brothers. Allah knows a squanderer from a good manager. Had Allah
wanted, He could have been hard on you. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise."</I>
(2:220) "To be hard on" is "to make difficult and constrict." <I>"'Anat"</I>
(19:111) means "to humble.'
<P>
It is related from Nafi', "Ibn 'Umar did not refuse to be anyone's executor."
<P>
That which Ibn Sirin liked best regarding the orphan's property was that
his advisors and guardians gather to him and investigate what was best for
him.
<P>
Tawus said, "When he was asked about anything regarding the business of the
orphans, he would recite, 'Allah knows the man who means mischief from the
man who means good.'"
<P>
'Ata' said about orphans, "The guardian spends on the young and old, each
one according to his share."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: Employing the orphan on a journey and at home if that is in his
best interests. The mother and her husband should look after the orphan</B>
<P>
2616. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came to Madina and did not have a servant. Abu Talha
took my hand and took me to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace. He said, 'O Messenger of Allah, Anas is a clever boy, so
take him for a servant.'" He said, "I served him on journeys and at home,
and he never said to me about something I had done, 'Why did you do this
like that?,' nor about something I had done, 'Why did you not do this?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: When land is made a <I>waqf</I> without its borders being stipulated,
that is allowed, and it is the same with <I>sadaqa</I></B>
<P>
2617. It is related from that Anas ibn Malik said, "Abu Talha had more property
in palm trees than any of the Ansar in Madina. His favourite property was
Bayruha' which was opposite the mosque. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to enter it and drink its sweet water."
Anas said, "When this <I>ayat</I> was sent down: '<I>You will not attain
true goodness until you give of what you love</I>,' Abu Talha stood up and
said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allah says, "<I>You will not attain true goodness
until you give of what you love</I>." The property I love the best is Bayruha'.
It is <I>sadaqa</I> for Allah whose goodness I hope for and I hope that it
will be stored up for me with Allah. Dispose of it in whatever way Allah
shows you.' He said, 'Excellent! That is a profitable property. (or a property
with good return - Ibn Maslama was unsure.) I think that you should give
it to your relatives.' Abu Talha said, 'I will do that, Messenger of Allah!'
So Abu Talha divided it among his relatives and cousins."
<P>
Malik has <I>"ra'ih" </I>(rather than <I>rabih</I>).
<P>
2618. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that a man said to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "My mother has died. Will it help
her if I give <I>sadaqa</I> on her behalf?" He answered, "Yes." He said,
"I have Mikhraf and I testify to you that I have given it as <I>sadaqa</I>
on her behalf."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: When a group make a <I>waqf</I> of a shared land, that is
permitted</B>
<P>
2619. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, commanded that the mosque be built and said, 'O Banu'n-Najjar!
Name me a price for this garden of yours.' They said, 'No, by Allah. We ask
no price for it except from Allah.'
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: How the waqf is written</B>
<P>
2620. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "'Umar got some land in Khaybar
and he went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
said, "O Messenger of Allah, I have got some land in Khaybar, and I have
got no property more precious to me than it. What do you command about it?"
He said, "If you wish, you can make its capital a <I>waqf</I> and you can
give it as <I>sadaqa</I>." He said, "'Umar gave it as <I>sadaqa</I> provided
that it would not be sold or given away or inherited. Its was for the poor,
relatives, slaves, in the way of Allah, for guests, and travellers. Its trustee
does nothing wrong if he consumes some of it in a correct and reasonable
manner or feeds his friend without storing up."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: The <I>waqf</I> for the wealthy, the poor, and guest</B>s
<P>
2621. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar found some property in Khaybar
and came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told
him and he said, "If you wish, you can make it <I>sadaqa</I>," and he made
it <I>sadaqa</I> for the poor, the needy, relatives and guests.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXI: The <I>waqf</I> of land for a mosque</B>
<P>
2622. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that when the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to Madina, he ordered the mosque
[be built] and said, "O Banu'n-Najjar! Name me a price for this garden of
yours." They said, "No, by Allah. We ask no price for it except from Allah."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXII: The <I>waqf</I> of riding animals, horses, goods and money</B>
<P>
Az-Zuhri [was asked] about the one who assigns a thousand dinars for the
way of Allah and gives it to a slave of his who is a merchant to trade with
and stipulates its profit is <I>sadaqa</I> for the poor and relatives: "Can
the man consume any of the profit of that thousand, even if he did not assign
its profit as <I>sadaqa</I> for the poor? " He said that he cannot consume
any of it.
<P>
2623. It is related from Ibn 'Umar gave away (a mount) a horse in the way
of Allah. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
had given it to him so that he could mount a man on it. 'Umar was informed
that he had put it up for sale. He asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, about buying it and he said, "Do not buy it.
Do not take back your <I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIII: Paying the administrator of a <I>waqf</I></B>
<P>
2624. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "My heirs do not distribute a dinar.
What I leave after the expenses of my wives and the payment of my agent is
<I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
2625. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar put a condition in his
<I>waqf</I> that its executor could eat and feed his friend without storing
up any property.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: When land or well is made a <I>waqf</I> and he stipulates for himself
the same use of the water as that which is assigned to the Muslims</B>
<P>
Anas made a waqf of a house and used to stay there when he went there.
<P>
Az-Zubayr gave his house as <I>sadaqa</I> and said that any of his daughters
who was divorced should live there without causing harm to others or harm
to her. If she was free of need by virtue of having a husband, then she had
no right to stay there.
<P>
Ibn 'Umar assigned his portion of the house of 'Umar to be lived in by those
of the family of 'Abdullah &nbsp;who were in need.
<P>
2626. It is related that when 'Uthman was under siege, he looked down on
them and said, "I ask you by Allah, and I ask none but the Companions of
the Prophet, do you not know that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever digs the well of Ruma will have the
Garden'? I dug it. Do you not know that he said, 'Whoever provisions the
Army of Hardship will have the Garden'?' I provisioned it." He said, "They
confirmed what he said."
<P>
'Umar said in his <I>waqf</I>, "There is no objection if its trustee consumes
some of it." The <I>waqf</I> can be managed by the one who makes it or by
someone else can tend it. The expression used includes both.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: When the one making the <I>waqf</I> says, "We do not ask its price
except from Allah," that is permitted.</B>
<P>
2627. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "O Banu'n-Najjar! Name me a price for this garden of yours."
They said, "No, by Allah. We ask no price for it except from Allah."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVI: The words of Allah Almighty:</B>
<P>
<I>"O you who believe! When one of you is near to death and makes a will,
two just men from among you should act as witnesses; or, if you are travelling
when the misfortune of death occurs, two men from other than yourselves.
You should detain them after the prayer and, if you are doubtful, they should
swear by Allah: 'We will not sell it for any price, even to a near relative,
and we will not conceal the testimony of Allah. If we did we would indeed
be among the wrongdoers.' If it then comes to light that the two of them
have merited the allegation of wrongdoing, two others who have the most right
to do so should take their place and swear by Allah: 'Our testimony is truer
than their testimony. We have not committed perjury. If we had we would indeed
be among the wrongdoers.' That makes it more likely that they will give their
evidence properly or be afraid that their oaths will be refuted by subsequent
oaths. Show fear of Allah and listen carefully. Allah does not guide degenerate
people." </I>(5:106-108) "'<I>Uthura</I>" is to be shown<I>. "A'tharna</I>"
is "We showed" (18:21)
<P>
2628. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A man went out from the Banu Sahm
with Tamim ad-Dari and 'Adi ibn Badda' and the Sahmi man died in a land where
there were no Muslims. When they brought his effects, they [the relatives]
noticed the absence of a silver goblet with gold engraving. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made them take an oath.
Then the goblet was found in Makka and they said, 'We bought it from Tamim
and 'Adi.' Two of the relatives of the deceased got up and swore, 'Our testimony
is truer than their testimony. The goblet belonged to their companion.'"
He stated, "It was about them that this <I>ayat</I> was sent down: '<I>O
you who believe! When one of you is near to death and makes a will, two just
men from among you should act as witnesses</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: The executor settling the debts of the deceased without the presence
of the heirs</B>
<P>
2629. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari that his father was
marytred at Uhud and left six daughters and also left debts. "When the time
for harvesting the dates came, I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, you know that
my father was martyred at Uhud and left many debts. I wish that the creditors
would see you.' He said, 'Go and put each type of date in a heap.' I did
that. Then I called him. When they saw him, they immediately bombarded me
with their claims at that moment. When he saw what they were doing, he walked
around the largest heap three times and then sat at it. Then he said, 'Summon
your companions.' He continued to weigh out for them until Allah settled
the account of my father. By Allah, I would have been pleased if Allah has
just settled my father's account and I had not returned with a single date
to my sisters. By Allah, the heaps were all whole, and I looked at the heap
where the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
been and it was as if it had not been decreased by a single date!"
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "<I>Ughr&ucirc; b&icirc; </I>means they pressed me, as
in <I>"We stirred up enmity and hatred between them."</I> (5:14)
