<B>I: The creation of Adam, may the blessings of Allah be upon him, and his
offspring</B>
<P>
"<I>Salsal</I>" (15:26) is clay mixed with sand, like the potter's mixture.
It is said to be fetid, meaning that it has a fetid smell and one says "the
door creaks (<I>sarr</I>) and creaks (<I>sarsara</I>) when it is closed,
and it is like <I>kabkaba</I> meaning <I>kabba</I>.<I> "She carried"
</I>(7:189) is that the pregnancy continued until full term. <I>"An la tasjidu"
</I>(7:12) is &nbsp;"to prostrate to".
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"When your Lord said to the angels:
'I am putting a khalif on the earth." </I>(2:30)</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that <I>"but has a guardian over it"</I> (86:4) means that
there is a protector over it.<I> "Fi kabad" </I>(90:4) is in the hardship
of creation. "<I>Riyash</I>" (7:26) is property. Someone else said that
<I>rayy&acirc;sh</I> and <I>r&icirc;sh</I> are the same, and it is what is
apparent of clothing.<I> "That you ejaculate" </I>(56:58) is sperm in the
woman's womb.
<P>
Mujahid said that <I>"Surely He has the power to return him (to life)"
</I>(86:8) is the drop in decomposition.
<P>
Everything He created is even, and the heaven is even, while the odd
(<I>witr</I>) is Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.
<P>
<I>"Fi ahsan taqwin"</I> (95:4) is in the best creation, and <I>"lowest of
the low"</I> (95:5) except those who believe. <I>"Khusr"</I> (103:2) is
misguidance. Then He excepted the one who believed. <I>"L&acirc;zib"
</I>(37:11) is clinging. <I>"Creating you" </I>(56:61) is in any creation
which We wish. <I>"We proclaim Your praise" </I>(2:37) is "We venerate You."
<P>
Abu'l-'Aliyya said, <I>"Then Adam &nbsp;received some words from his Lord"</I>
(2:37) is the words,<I> "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves." </I>(7:23)
<I>"He made them slip" </I>(2:36) is that He made them err. <I>"Yatassannahu"
</I>(2:259) means "to be altered". <I>"Asin" </I>(47:15) means "changed"
and <I>masn&ucirc;n </I>means "changed". <I>"Hama'" </I>(15:26) is the plural
of <I>hama'a</I>, which is clay that has been changed. <I>"Yakhsif&acirc;n"
</I>(7:22) means to take bunches of leaves from the Garden and to put the
leaves together. <I>"Saw&acirc;tuhum&acirc;"</I> (7:22) is an allusion to
their private parts. <I>"Enjoyment for a time" </I>(7:24) is from nowuntil
the Day of Rising.<I> "h&icirc;n"</I> among the Arabs can be from an hour
to an unlimited amount of time, <I>Qab&icirc;lihi" </I>(7:27) is his tribe
which he is from.
<P>
3148. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Adam was created and his height was sixty cubits.
Then He said, 'Go and greet those angels and listen to how they greet you.
It will be your greeting and the greeting of your offspring.' He said, 'Peace
be upon you,' and they said, 'Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah,'
and they added, 'and the mercy of Allah.' Everyone who ends the Garden will
be in form of Adam. People have been getting shorter until now."
<P>
3149. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The first group to enter the Garden
will be like the moon on the night of the full moon, then those who follow
them will be like the brightest planet in light. They will not need to urinate
or defecate or spit nor blow their noses. Their combs will be golden and
and their perspiration will be like musk. Their braziers will burn fragrant
aloes-wood. Their wives will be the houris, They will all have the same stature
and their their form will be that of their father Adam, sixty cubits in the
sky."
<P>
3150. It is related from Umm Salama that Umm Sulaym said, "Messenger of Allah,
Allah is not shy about the truth. Does a woman have do a <I>ghusl</I> when
she has a wet dream?" He said, "Yes, when she has a visible discharge." Umm
Salama laughed and said, "Do women have wet dreams?" He asked, "Why does
her child resemble her?"
<P>
3151. It is related that Anas said, "When 'Abdullah ibn Salam heard of the
arrival of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
in Madina, he went to him and said, 'I will ask you about three things which
only a Prophet knows. What is the first sign of the Hour? What is the first
food that the people of the Garden will eat? And for what reason does a child
resemble his father and for what reason does he resemble his maternal uncles?'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Jibril
has just informed me about them.'" He said that 'Abdullah said, "That is
the enemy of the Jews among the angels."
<P>
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The
first sign of the Hour will be a fire which will gather people from the east
to the west. The first food that the people of the Garden will eat will be
the extra bit of the liver of the fish. As for the child's resemblance, when
the man has intercourse with the woman and his discharge is first, it will
resemble him. If she has a discharge first, then it will resemble her." He
said, "I testify that you are the Messenger of Allah." Then he said, "O Messenger
of Allah, the Jews are a calumnious people. If they know about my Islam before
you ask them about me, they will slander me in your presence. The Jews came
and 'Abdullah went into the house. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "What kind of man is 'Abdullah ibn Salam among
you?" They said, "The most knowledgeable of us, and the son of the most
knowledgeable of us, and the best of us and the son of the best of us." The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "What
would you think if 'Abdullah were to become Muslim?" They said, "We seek
refuge with Allah from that!" 'Abdullah came out to them and said, "I testify
that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger
of Allah." They said, "The worst of us and the son of the worst of us," and
began to disparage him.
<P>
3152. The like of it is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. He said, "Were it not for the tribe of Israel,
meat would not decay, and where it not for Hawwa', wives would not betray
their husbands."
<P>
3153. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Treat women well. Woman was created
from a rib. The most crooked part of the rib is the top part. If you try
to straighten it, you will break it. If you leave it, it remains crooked.
So treat women well."
<P>
3154. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, who is the truthful confirmed one, said, 'The
way that each of you is created is that you are gathered in your mother's
womb for forty days and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot
and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then Allah sends
an angel with four commandments: to write down his actions, his life-span,
his provision, and whether you will be wretched or happy. Then the spirit
is breathed into him. So a man can do the the actions of someone destined
for the Fire until there is only an armspan between him and it, and then
what is written will overtake him and he will do the actions of someone destined
for the Garden and enter the Garden. A man can do the actions of someone
destined for the Garden until there is only an armspan between him and it,
and then what is written will overtake him and he will do the actions of
someone destined for the Fire and enter the Fire.'"
<P>
3155. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Allah appoints an angel to the womb who says,
'O Lord! A sperm drop! O Lord A clot! O Lord! A lump of flesh! ' Then if
He desires to complete His creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord! Is it to be
male? O Lord! Or is it female? O Lord! Wretched or happy? What is its provision?
What is its life-span?' This is all decreed in the mother's womb."
<P>
3156. It is related from Anas that Allah will say to the person who has the
least punishment in the Fire, "If you were to have everything in the earth,
would you ransom yourself with it?" He will answer, "Yes." He will say, "I
asked you for less than this when you were in the loins of Adam: not to associate
with Me, but you refused to do anything but associate."
<P>
3157. It is related that 'Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "No self is unjustly killed without
responsibility for it falling on the elder son of Adam because he was the
first to make a sunna of murder."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Spirits are assembled armies</B>
<P>
3158. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, 'Spirits are assembled armies. Those who are
know one another are friendly to one another, and those who do not know one
another disagree.'"
<P>
Yahya ibn Ayyub said that Yahya ibn Sa'id related this.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The words of Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, <I>"We sent Noah to his
People"</I> (11:25)</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that <I>"badi'-r-ra'y" </I>(11:27) means what appears to
us. <I>"Iqli'i" </I>(11:44) is to refrain. <I>"The oven boiled </I>" (11:40)
means that water gushed up. 'Ikrima said that it is the surface of the earth.
Mujahid said that al-Judi (11:44) is a mountain in Mesopotamia. <I>"Da'b"
</I>(40:31) is "like the state."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The words of Allah Almighty, "We sent Noah to his People: 'Warn your
people before a painful punishment comes to them ...." </B>(71:1 to the end
of the sura)
<P>
<I>"Recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his people, 'O my people!
If my standing here and reminding you of Allah's Signs has become too much
for you to bear, know that I have put my trust in Allah. So decide, you and
your gods, on what you want to do and be open about it. Do with me whatever
you decide and do not keep me waiting. If you turn your backs, I have not
asked you for any wage. My wage is with Allah alone. I am commanded to be
one of the Muslims.'"</I> (10:71-72)
<P>
3159. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, stood up among the people and praised Allah
as He deserved and then mentioned the Dajjal. He said, 'I warn you of him,
and there is no Prophet who has not warned his people of him. Nuh warned
his people, but I say to you about him something which no Allah has said
to his people. You should know that he is one-eyed, and that Allah is not
one-eyed.'"
<P>
3160. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Shall I inform you of something
about the Dajjal of which no Prophet has informed his community? He is one-eyed.
He will bring with him likenesses of the Garden and the Fire. What he says
is the Garden is, in fact, the Fire.I warn you as Nuh warned his people."
<P>
3161. It is related that Abu Sa'id said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Nuh and his community will be
brought and Allah Almighty will say, 'Did you convey it?' He will say, 'Yes,
O Lord.' He will say to his commmunity, 'Did he convey it to you?' They will
reply, 'No, no Prophet came to us.' He will say to Nuh, 'Who will testify
on your behalf?' He will say, 'Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and his community.' So he will testify that he conveyed it. That is
His words, may His mention be exalted!: <I>'Hence We have made you a middlemost
community, so that you may act as witnesses against mankind,' </I>(2:143)"
The "middlemost" is fair.
<P>
3162. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "We were with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, responding to an invitation.
He picked up the leg, which he liked, and ate some of it. He said, 'I will
be the master of people on the Day of Rising. Do you know what that will
entail? Allah will gather the first and the last on the same plain so that
an observer will be able to see them, and some people will say, 'Do you not
see what a state you are in and what has come to you? Why do you not look
for someone to intercede with your Lord on your behalf?' Some people will
say, 'Your father Adam!' They will come to him and say, 'O Adam! You are
the father of mankind. Allah created you with His hand and breathed some
of His spirit into you and He ordered the angels to prostrate to you. He
made you dwell in the Garden. Will you not intercede with your Lord on our
behalf? Do you not see what we are suffering and what has happened to us?'
He will say, 'My Lord is angry today with such anger as has never existed
before nor will again. He forbade me the Tree and I disobeyed. O my soul!
My soul! My soul! Go to someone else. Go to Nuh.'
<P>
"They will go to Nuh and say, 'O Nuh! You are the first of the Messengers
to be sent to the people of the earth and Allah called you a thankful slave.
Do you not see what we are suffering and what has happened to us?' Will you
not intercede with your Lord on our behalf?' He will say, 'My Lord is angry
today with such anger as has never existed before nor will again. O my soul!
My soul! My soul! Go to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'
They will come to me and I will prostrate under the Throne. It will be said,
'O Muhammad! Lift your head. Intercede and your intercession will be granted,
Ask and you will be given.'"
<P>
Muhammad ibn 'Ubayd said, "I do not remember the rest of it."
<P>
3163. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, recited<I>, "But is there any rememberer there?"
</I>(54:15) as in the normal reading.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Chapter</B>
<P>
<I>"And Ilyas was one of the Messengers. When he said to his people, 'Will
you not be godfearing? Do you call on Baal and abandon the Best of Creators?
Allah is your Lord and Lord of your forefathers, the earlier peoples.' They
denied him and so they will be among the arraigned. Except for Allah's chosen
slaves. We left the later people saying of him, Peace be upon the family
of Yasin!' That is how We recompense all good-doers. He truly was one of
Our believing slaves." </I>(37:123-132)
<P>
It is mentioned from Ibn Mas'ud and Ibn 'Abbas that Ilyas was Idris.
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Concerning Idris, peace be upon him</B>
<P>
He is the grandfather of Nuh's father, and it is said that he was the grandfather
of Nuh, peace be upon them both
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "We raised him up to a high place."</I> (19:57)
<P>
3164. It is related that Anas said that Abu Dharr used to relate that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "During
the time that I was in Makka, the roof of my house was opened up and Jibril
descended and opened up my breast, washing it with Zamzam water. Then he
brought a gold basin filled with wisdom and belief. He poured it into my
breast and then closed it. Then he took my hand and took me up to the lowest
heaven. When I reached the lowest heaven, Jibril said to the keeper of the
heaven, 'Open!' He asked, 'Who is this?' He replied, 'This is Jibril.' He
asked, 'Is anyone with you?' He said, 'Yes, Muhammad is with me.' He asked,
'Has he been sent for?' He said, 'Yes, so open!.'
<P>
"When the way opened we climbed above the lowest heaven and found a man sitting
there, with people on his right and people on his left. When he looked to
his right, he laughed, and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said,
'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet and virtuous son.' I said to Jibril, 'Who
is this?' He said, 'This is Adam and these people on his right and his left
are the souls of his descendants. The people on the right are the people
of the Garden and the people who are on his left are the people of the Fire.
When he looks to his right, he laughs and when he looks to his left, he weeps.'
Then he took me up to the second heaven and said to its keeper, 'Open.' Its
keeper said to him the same as the first one had said and then made the way
open."
<P>
Anas said that he (the Prophet) mentioned that in the heavens he found Adam,
Idris, Musa, 'Isa, and Ibrahim, blessings be upon them. He did not specify
their positions, except for mentioning that he found Adam in the lowest heaven
and Ibrahim in the sixth heaven.
<P>
Anas said, "When Jibril together with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, passed by Idris, he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet
and virtuous brother!' I said, 'Who is this?' He said, 'This is Idris.' Then
I passed by Musa and he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet and virtuous
brother!' I asked, 'Who is this?' He replied, 'This is Musa.' Then I passed
by 'Isa and he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous brother and virtuous Prophet!'
I said, 'Who is this?' He answered, 'This is 'Isa.' Then I passed by Ibrahim
and he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet and virtuous son!' I said,
'Who is this?' He said, 'This is Ibrahim.'"
<P>
It is reported that Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Habba al-Ansari used to say that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Then I was taken
up until I appeared on a high plateau where I heard the scratching of pens."
<P>
Ibn Hazm and Anas ibn Malik said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Allah prescribed fifty prayers for my community and
I returned with that until I passed by Musa. He said, 'What has Allah prescribed
to you for your community?' I said, 'He has prescribed fifty prayers.`" He
said, 'Go back to your Lord. Your community will not be able to manage that.'
He made me go back and He reduced it to half. Then I returned to Musa and
I said, 'He reduced them to half.' He said, 'Go back to your Lord. Your community
will not be able to manage that.' I returned and He halved them again and
I returned to him. He said, 'Go back to your Lord. Your community will not
be able to manage that.' I returned to Him and He said, "'They are five and
they are fifty. My word does not change.' I went back to Musa and he said,
'Return to your Lord. I said, 'I am too embarassed before my Lord.' Then
he took me on until he brought me to the Lote-tree of the Boundary which
was covered in colours which I did not recognise. Then I was brought into
the Garden and in it were strings of pearls and its earth was made of musk."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"And to 'Ad their brother Hud who
said, 'O my people, worship Allah!'" </I>(7:65) and His words<I>, "When he
warned his people by the sand-dunes </I>&#150; to His words -<I> Thus do
We repay the people of the evil-doers!"</I> (46:21-25)</B>
<P>
In it is 'A'isha from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
The words of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, <I>"'Ad were destroyed by a
savage howling wind." </I>Ibn 'Uyayna said that it was too strong for its
guardian angels<I>. "Allah subjected them to it for seven whole nights and
eight whole days without a break. You could see the people flattened in their
homes just like the hollow stumps of uprooted palms. Do you see any remnant
of them left?"</I>(69:6-8)
<P>
3165. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "I was helped to victory by the east wind and
'Ad was destroyed by the west wind."
<P>
3166.It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "'Ali sent the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, a piece of gold and he divided between two
people: al-Aqra' ibn Habis al-Hanzali al-Mujashi'i, 'Utba ibn Badr al-Fazari,
Zayd at-Ta'i (then one of the Banu Nabhan), and 'Alqama ibn 'Ulatha al-'Amiri
(then of the Banu Kilab). Quraysh and the Ansar became angry and said, 'He
gives to the chiefs of Najd and leaves us out!' He said, 'I am reconciling
them.' Then a man with sunken eyes, high cheeks, raised forehead, thick beard
and shaven head came forward said, 'Fear Allah, O Muhammad!' He said, 'Who
would obey Allah if I were to disobey Him? When Allah has entrusted me over
the people of the earth, do you not trust me?' A man - whom I think was Khalid
ibn al-Walid - asked to kill him, but he prevented him. When he turned away,
he said, 'Among the offspring of this one - or among the descendants of this
one - will be a people who will recite the Qur'an, but it will not go beyond
their throats. They will leave the <I>deen</I> like the arrow passes through
game, They will kill the people of Islam and leave the idolaters alone. If
I were to reach them, then I would kill them as 'Ad was killed.'"
<P>
3167. It is related from 'Abdullah said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recite, <I>'But is there any rememberer
there?"</I>'" (54:15)
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: The story of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog)</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "They will ask you about Dhu'l-Qarnayn. Say:
'I will relate an account of him to you. We gave him power and authority
on the earth and granted him a way to everything. So he followed a way</I>
- to His words - <I>'Bring me ingots of iron!' </I>(one is a <I>zubra</I>,
They are pieces) <I>Then, when he had made it level between the two high
mountain-sides. </I>(Ibn 'Abbas says that it is two mountains. <I>Saddayn</I>
are two mountains and <I>kharjan</I> is payment.) He said, 'Blow (with your
bellows)<I>" When he had made it a red hot fire, he said, 'Bring me molten
brass to pour on it.</I>' (This is said to lead or &nbsp;iron or brass. Ibn
'Abbas said that it is copper.) <I>They were, therefore, unable to climb
over it</I> (to get over it. <I>Asta'a</I> is Form X <I>(istaf'ala</I>) from
'to have the power for <I>(t&acirc;'</I>) That is why it takes the
<I>fatha</I> as <I>asta'a, yast&icirc;</I>', although some say
<I>astat&acirc;', yastat&icirc;'</I>) or to dig through it.) <I>He said,
'This is a mercy from my Lord: But when my Lord's promise comes about, He
will crush it flat (</I> so that it is flat on the earth. The camel which
is <I>dakka' </I>is the one with no hump, and the term applies to the earth
similarly so that it is the solid and thick earth.)<I> The promise of my
Lord is surely true.' We will abandon them, that Day, to pound against each
other in surging waves." </I>(18:83-99)
<P>
And <I>"When Yajuj and Majuj are let loose and rush down from every slope."
</I>(21:96)
<P>
Qatada said that "<I>hadab</I>" is a hill. A man said to the Prophet*, "I
have seen the mountain which is like the lined cloak." He said, "You have
seen it."
<P>
<A HREF="muw19.html#g22">3168</A>. It is related from Zaynab bint Jahsh is
that once the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came in to
her while he was upset and said, "There is no god but Allah. Woe to the Arabs
from an evil which is drawing near! An opening has been made in the wall
of Ya'juj and Ma'juj like this," and he made a circle with his thumb and
forefinger." Zaynab bint Jahsh said, "I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, will
we be destroyed when the righteous are among us?' He said, 'Yes, if there
is a lot of wickedness.'"
<P>
3169. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "An opening has been made in the wall of Ya'juj
and Ma'juj like this," and he made his hand represent ninety.
<P>
3170. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty will say, 'O Adam!'
He will say, 'At Your service and obedience, and good is in Your hand.' He
will say, 'Bring out the people of the Fire.' He will say, 'How many are
the people of the Fire?' He will say, 'Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of
every thousand.' At that time the child will become white-haired and <I>'every
pregnant woman will abort the contents of her womb, and you will think people
drunk when they are not drunk, it is just that the punishment of Allah is
so severe.' </I>(22:2) They said, 'O Messenger of Allah! Who is that one!'
He said, 'Rejoice, there is one man from among you and one thousand from
Ya'juj and Ma'juj.' Then he said, 'By the One who has my soul in His hand,
I hope that you will be a quarter of the people of the Garden.' We said,
'Allah is greater!' He said, 'I hope that you will be a third of the people
of the Garden.' We said, 'Allah is greater!' He said, 'I hope that you will
be half of the people of the Garden.' We said, 'Allah is greater!' He said,
' Among people you are only like a black hair on the hide of a white ox,
or like a white hair on the hide of a black ox.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Allah took Ibrahim as an intimate
friend"</I> (4:125) and His words, <I>"Ibrahim was in himself a nation,
exemplary, obedient to Allah," </I>(16:125) and His words,<I> "Ibrahim was
tender-hearted and forbearing."</I> (9:114)</B>
<P>
Abu Maysara said that <I>rah&icirc;m</I> is an Abyssinian word.
<P>
3171. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "You will be gathered to Allah Almighty barefoot,
naked and uncircumcised.<I> 'As We originated the first creation so We will
regenerate it. It is a promise binding on Us. That is what We will do.'
</I>(21: 103) The first of creatures to be clothed on the Day of Rising will
be Ibrahim. People of my community will come and will be taken to the left.
I will say, 'O Lord, my Companions! my Companions!' and it will be said,
'They never stopped turning back on their heels from the time you left them.'
I will say the same as the righteous slave ('Isa) said, <I>''I was a witness
against them as long as I remained among them" </I>to <I>"You are the Almighty,
the All-Wise.' </I>(5:117-118)"
<P>
3172. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him

of Rising, and darkness and dust will be on the face of Azar. Ibrahim will
say to him, 'Did I not tell you not to disobey me?' His father will say,
'Today I will not disobey you.' Ibrahim will say, 'O Lord, You promised me
that You would not disagrace me on the Day when they are raised up! What
disgrace is greater than that of my father being far from mercy!' Allah Almighty
will say, 'I have made the Garden unlawful for the unbelievers.' Then it
will be said, 'O Ibrahim! What is under your feet?' He will look and there
will be a blood-stained hyena which will be taken by the legs and thrown
into the Fire."

3173. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, entered the House and in it he found an image of Ibrahim
and an image of Maryam. He stated, 'What is wrong with them? They have heard
that angels do not enter a house with an image. This is Ibrahim depicted
and why is he practising divination with arrows?'"
<P>
3174. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that when the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, saw the pictures in the House, he did not enter
it until he had commanded that they be effaced. He saw Ibrahim and Isma'il
holding divining arrows in their hands. He said, "Allah curse them! By Allah,
they know that neither of them ever used divining arrows."

3175. It is related from Abu Hurayra that it was asked, "Messenger of Allah,

Allah." They said, "This is not what we meant." He said, "Yusuf, the Prophet
of Allah, son of a Prophet of Allah, son of a Prophet of Allah, son of the
Friend of Allah." They said, "This is not what we meant either." He said,
"Is it then about the Arabs that you asking? The best of them in the Time
of Ignorance is the best of them in Islam when they have knowledge (of the
<I>deen</I>)."

and took me to a tall man who was so tall that I almost could not see his
head. It was Ibrahim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
3177. It is related that Mujahid said that he heard Ibn 'Abbas when they
mentioned that the Dajjal has "<I>Kafir</I>" (unbeliever) or
"<I>Kaf-Fa'-Ra</I>'" written between his eyes.' He, "I did not hear that,
but I did hear him say, 'As for Ibrahim, look at your Companion, and Musa
had curly hair and brownish skin. He used to ride a red camel with reins
of fibre. It is as if I could visualise Musa descending into the valley.'"
<P>
3178. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was
circumcised with an adz when he was eighty."
<P>
"With an adz" is related from Abu'z-Zinad. It is corroborated by 'Ajlan from
Abu Hurayra. Muhammad ibn Amr related it from Abu Salama
<P>
3179. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Ibrahim only lied three times."
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra that said, "Ibrahim, peace be upon him, only
told three lies, two were for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic,
when He said, 'I am sick' and 'The bigges tof them did it.'" He said, "While
he was with Sara, he went by one of the tyrants who was told, 'Here is a
man with a woman who was one of the most beautiful. He sent a message to
him to ask about her, 'Who is this woman?' He said, 'My sister.' He went
to Sara and said, 'O Sara, there are no believers on the earth except me
and you. This one has asked me and I have told him that you are my sister.
Do not contradict what I have said.' He sent for her and when she went to
him, he tried to take hold of her with his hand and he had a seizure. He
said, 'Pray to Allah and I will not harm you.' She prayed to Allah and he
was released and then he tried to take her a second time and had a similar
seizure, or worse still. He said, 'Pray to Allah and I will not harm you.'
She prayed to Allah and he was released. He summoned one his chamberlains
and said, 'By Allah, you have not brought me a human being. You have only
brought me a devil!' He gave her Hajar as a servant. She returned to him
while he was praying and he made a questioning gesture. She said, 'Allah
has turned foiled the scheme of the unbeliever or the reprobate and given
Hajar as a servant'"

himself?' He answered, 'It is not as you say, <I>"Do</I> <I>not mix up their
faith with &nbsp;any wrongdoin'</I>" is <I>shirk</I>. Have you not heard

of Rising Allah will gather the first and the last on the same plain so that
a speaker make them hear and an observer will be able to see them. The sun
will be brought near to them' - and he mentioned the <I>hadith</I> of
intercession - 'They will go to Ibrahim and say, 'O Ibrahim! You are the
Prophet of Allah and His close friend among the people of the earth. Intercede
with your Lord on our behalf,' and he will mention his lies and say, "O my
soul! My soul! My soul! Go to Musa."'"

3183. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "May Allah have mercy on the mother of Isma'il.
If she had not hastened, Zamzam would have become a running stream."
<P>
3184. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "That is not how Ibn 'Abbas
related it to me. He said, 'Ibrahim brought the mother of Isma'il and her
son, Isma'il, whom she was nursing, and she had a water-skin with her.' He
did not make it marfu'. 'Then Ibrahim took her and her son Isma'il...'"
<P>
3185. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The first woman to use a girdle
was the mother of Isma'il. She used a girdle to hide her tracks from Sara.
Then Ibrahim brought her and her son, Isma'il, whom she was nursing and put
her near the House by a tall tree above Zamzam in the upper part of the mosque.
At that time no one lived in Makka and there was no water there. He put them
there and left with her a bag with some dates in it and a waterskin with
some water in it. Then Ibrahim returned the way he had come. Isma'il's mother
followed him and said, 'O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this
valley in which there are no people or anything else?' She said that to him
several times but he did not turn to her. She said to him, 'Has Allah commanded
you to do this?' He answered, 'Yes.' She said, 'Then He will not let us come
to harm,' and went back. Ibrahim went on until he reached ath-Thaniyya where
they could not see him. He turned to face the House and then made a supplication
with these words. He raised his hands and said,<I> 'O our Lord, I have settled
some of my offspring in an uncultivated valley </I>. . .to . . <I>.so that
hopefully they may will thankful.' </I>(14:37-39) Isma'il's mother began
to suckle him and drink from the water until the water in the skin had run
out. She was thirsty and her son was thirsty. She looked at him twisting
about" - or he said, "rolling on the ground" - "and then walked away, not
wanting to look at him. Safa was the nearest hill to her and she climbed
up it and then looked around the valley to see if there was anyone there.
She could not see anyone and descended from Safa until she reached the valley.
Then she lifted the edge of her skirt and ran as an overwrought person runs
until she had crossed the valley. Then she came to Marwa and stood on it
and looked to see whether there was anyone there. She could not see anyone.
She did that seven times." Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "That is why people run between them." "Then,
on Marwa, when she looked she heard a voice and said, 'Listen!' trying to
hear. Then she listened and heard and said, 'I have heard if You possess
any relief.' Suddenly there was an angel at the site of Zamzam. He struck
the ground with his heel - or his wing - until water appeared. She made a
container with her hands, like this, and began to scoop up the water into
her waterskin and it bubbled up each time she scooped."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "May Allah have mercy on the mother of Isma'il. If she had left Zamzam"
- or he said, "If she had not scooped up the water" - "Zamzam would have
begun as a running stream." He said, "She drank and suckled her son and the
angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid of perishing. This boy and his father
will build a house here for Allah. Allah will not let its people perish.
The house was higher than the land around it, like on a hill to which floods
come and then go to the right and left of it. She remained like that until
a group of the Jurhum, or people from a clan of Jurhum, coming by way of
Kada' alighted at the bottom of Makka and saw birds circling round and said,
'These birds are circling around water. We are familiar with this valley
and there is no water in it.' They sent one or two scouts and when they found
the water, they returned and told them. They advanced and found Isma'il's
mother at the water. They said, 'Will you give us permission to alight here
with you?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to the water.' They said,
'Yes.'"
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "This happened to Isma'il's mother because she desired human companionship.
They alighted and sent for their families and settled there with them so
that they became people with houses. The boy grew up and learned Arabic from
them. As a youth, he was the dearest and most admired of them. When he came
of age, he married a woman from among them. Isma'il's mother died and Ibrahim
came after Isma'il had married to look for something he had left behind.
He did not find Isma'il at home. He asked his wife about him and she said,
'He has gone out to look for food for us.' Then he asked about their life
and circumstances. She said, 'We are in a very bad way. We are suffering
constriction and hardship,' and she complained to him. He said, 'When your
husband comes, greet him from me and tell him to change his door lintel.'
When Isma'il came, it was as if he sensed something and he said, 'Did someone
come?' She said, 'Yes, such-and-such an old man came and he asked about you
and I told him. He asked me about our life and I told him that we were suffering
difficulty and hardship.' He said, 'Did he give you any advice?' She said,
'Yes. He told me to give you greetings and to say: "Change the lintel of
your door."' He said, 'That was my father and he has commanded that I separate
from you. Go back to your family.' So he divorced her and married another
woman from them. Ibrahim remained away from them as long as Allah wished
and then he visited them again and did not find him at home. He visited his
wife and asked about him and she said, 'He has gone out looking for food
for us.' He said, 'How are you?' and he asked her about their life and
circumstances. She said, 'We are well,' and she praised Allah Almighty. He
said, 'What is your food?' She said, 'Meat.' He said, 'What is your drink?'
She said, 'Water.' He said, 'O Allah, bless them in their meat and water.'"
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "At that time
they did not have grain. If they had had it, he would have prayed for them
in respect of it as well." He said, "This is why no one except the people
of Makka can manage with these two alone when they do not agree with other
people.'"
<P>
"He said, 'When your husband comes, give him the greeting and tell him to
strengthen the lintel of his door.' When Isma'il came, he said, 'Did someone
come to you?' She said, 'Yes, an old man of handsome appearance came to us,'
and she praised him. 'He asked me about you and I told him and he asked me
how our life was and I told him that we were well.' He said, 'Did he give
you any advice?' She said, 'Yes, he gave you the greeting and told you to
strengthen the lintel of your door.' He said, 'That was my father. You are
the lintel. He told me to keep you.' Then he remained away from them for
as long as Allah wished. Then he came after that one day while Isma'il was
sharpening his arrows under a large tree near Zamzam. When he saw him, he
went to him and did as a father does with a son and a son with a father.
He said, 'Isma'il, Allah has given me a command.' He said, 'Do what Allah
has commanded you.' He said, 'Will you help me.'.He said, 'I will help you.'
He said, 'Allah has commanded me to build a house here,' and he pointed at
a mound which was higher than the surrounding land. In that place he laid
the foundations of the House. Isma'il began to bring stones and Ibrahim laid
them until the structure reached a certain height. Then he brought a stone
and placed it for him and he stood on it, building, while Isma'il passed
up the stones to him. They were saying, <I>'Our Lord! Accept this from us:
for You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.'</I>" (2:127) He said, "They
went on building until they had gone around the House saying<I>, 'Our Lord!
Accept this from us: for You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</I>'"
<P>
3185. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When Ibrahim and his wife had
the differences they had, he went out with Isma'il and Isma'il's mother with
a waterskin, containing some water. Isma'il's mother began to drink from
the waterskin and suckled her child until he reached Makka where he placed
her under a large tree. Then Ibrahim left to return to his family. Isma'il's
mother followed him until they reached Kada', when she called out behind
him, 'O Ibrahim! With whom are you leaving us?' He said, 'With Allah.' She
said, 'I am satisfied with Allah,' and she went back and began to drink from
the waterskin and nurse her child until the water was finished. She said,
'If I go and look perhaps I will find someone.'" He said, "She went and climbed
Safa and looked and looked to see whether she could find someone, but she
did not see anyone. When she reached the valley, she ran and came to Marwa.
She did that several times. Then she said, 'I should go and see what is happening
with the child.' She went and looked and there he was in the same condition
as if he was gasping at the brink of death. She could not contain herself
and said, 'If I go and look perhaps I will find someone.' She went and climbed
Safa and looked and looked but did not see anyone, until she had done that
seven times. Then she had just said, 'I should go and look and see what is
happening with him,' when she heard a voice. She said, 'Help me, if You possess
any good!' Then Jibril appeared and dug his heel into the earth ( he said,
"Like this with his heel.") and water began to spring up. Isma'il's mother
was astonished and began to dig."
<P>
He said that Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"If she had left it, it would have been flowing water." He said, "She began
to drink the water and give her milk to her child." He said, "Some people
of the Jurhum passed through the bottom of the valley and saw birds there
and did not recognise that, They said, 'These birds are only where there
is water.' They sent a messenger and looked and there was water. They went
to them and informed them. They went to her and said, 'Mother of Isma'il,
will you give us permission to be with you - or live with you?' Her son grew
up and marriage one of their women. Then it occurred to Ibrahim and he said
to his wife, 'I will see my descendants.'"
<P>
He said, "He came and greeted and said, 'Where is Isma'il?' His wife said,
'He has gone hunting.' He said, 'When he comes, tell him to change his door
lintel.' When he came, she told him He said, 'You are that. Go to your family.'"
<P>
Then he said, Then a thought occurred to Ibrahim and he told his wife, 'I
will see my descendants.'"
<P>
He said, "He came and greeted and asked, 'Where is Isma'il?' His wife replied,
'He has gone hunting.' She said, 'Will you not alight and eat and drink?'
He asked, 'What is your food and what is your drink?' She said, 'Our food
is meat and our drink is water.' He said, 'O Allah, bless them in their food
and drink.'" He said that Abu'l-Qasim said, "That is the blessing of the
supplication of Ibrahim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
Then he said, "Then a thought again occurred to Ibrahim and he said to his
wife, 'I will see my descendants.' So he came while Isma'il was sharpening
his arrows behind Zamzam. When he saw him, he went to him and did as a father
does with a son and a son with a father. He said, 'Isma'il, your Lord has
given me a command. to buils Him a house' He said, 'Obey your Lord.' He said,
'He has commanded that you help me do it.'.He said, 'Then I will do so,'
or words to that effect." He said, "They got up and Ibrahim began to build
while Isma'il was passing him the stones, aand they were saying, '<I>Our
Lord! Accept this from us: for You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</I>.'"
(2:127) He said, "When the building was high and the old man was too weak
to shift the stones, he stood on the rock of the Maqam, and he continued
to the pass the stones to him, while they were saying, '<I>Our Lord! Accept
this from us: for You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</I>'"

was the first mosque built on the earth?' He replied, 'The Masjid
al-Haram.'&nbsp;'I said, 'Then which one?' He answered, 'The Masjid al-Aqsa.'
I asked, 'How long was there between them?' He said, 'Forty years.' Then
he said, 'Whenever the prayer comes when you are there at its time, pray
it. There is excellence in it [in doing it at its time].'"

He said, 'If it had not been that your people were only recently unbelievers,
I would have done that.'"

'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "'A'isha heard this from the Messenger of Allah,

Allah." They said, "This is not what we meant." He said, "Yusuf, the Prophet
of Allah, son of a Prophet of Allah, son of a Prophet of Allah, son of the
Friend of Allah." They said, "This is not what we meant either." He said,
"Is it then about the origins of the Arabs that you asking? The best of them
in the Time of Ignorance is the best of them in Islam when they have knowledge
(of the <I>deen</I>)."

he will weep." He repeated what he had said and she repeated what she had
said. Shu'ba said that he said on the third or fourth time, "You are the
companions of Yusuf! Tell Abu Bakr!"
<P>
3205. It is related that Abu Musa said that the Prophet, may Allah bless

people in prayer. 'A'isha said that Abu Bakr was a certain sort of man (i.e.
tender-hearted). He said that like of what he had and said and she also said
the like. He said, "Tell Abu Bakr, companions of Yusuf!" So Abu Bakr led

to a certain person!"' She said, 'I said, "Why?" She said, "He has mentioned
the tale." 'A'isha said, "What tale?" and she told her. She said, "Have Abu
Bakr and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
heard it?" She said, "Yes." She fainted and went she came around, she had
a fever and was shaking. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
came and said, "What is this?" I said, "A fever which she has got on account
a tale which is being talked about." She sat up and said, "If Allah, even
if I were to swear to you, you would not believe me. Even I were to offer
an excuse, you would not excuse me. My example is like that of Ya'qub and
his sons. <I>'It is Allah alone who is my Help in face of the event that
you describe.' </I>(12:18)" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, left and then Allah sent down what He sent down and informed her.
She said, "Praise belongs to Allah, but no praise to anyone else."'"
<P>
3209. It is related that 'Urwa asked 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, "What do you think about His words,
<I>'Then when the Messengers despaired and thought themselves denied.'</I>
(12:110) Or did they think that they were denied? She said, "Indeed their
people actually denied them." I said, "By Allah, they were certain that their
people had denied them, and it was not a suspicion?" She said, "O 'Urayya
(little 'Urwa), they were certain of that. I said, "Or perhaps they thought
that they denied?" She said, "I seek refuge with Allah! The Messengers do
not suspect their Lord! This <I>ayat</I>," she said, "is about the followers
of the Messengers who believed in their Lord and affirmed Him. The affliction
lasted long for them and victory was delayed for them so that they gave up
hope of those of their people who denied them and suspected that their followers
had denied. Then the help of Allah came."

Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show me Yourself so that I may look
at You! ' He said, 'You will not see Me, but look at the mountain. If it
remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.' But when His Lord manifested
Himself to the mountain, He crushed it flat and Musa fell unconscious to
the ground. When he regained consciousness he said, 'Glory be to You! I turn
in repentance to You and I am the first of the believers!'" </I>(7:142-143)

<B>XXVIII: The story of al-Khidr with Musa, peace be upon both of them</B>
<P>
3219. Ibn 'Abbas transmitted that he and Hurr ibn Qays ibn Hisn al-Fazari
argued about Musa's companion. Ibn 'Abbas said that it was Khidr. Ubayy ibn
Ka'b passed by them and Ibn 'Abbas called him over and said, "My companion
and I are arguing about the companion of Musa whom Musa asked to meet. Did
you hear the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mention him?"
He said, "Yes, I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, say, 'While Musa was in a gathering of the Banu Isra'il, a man
came to him and said, "Do you know of anyone who has more knowledge than
you?" Musa said that he did not and then Allah revealed to Musa, "Indeed,
Our slave Khidr has." Musa asked the way to find him and Allah gave him the
fish as a sign and told Musa that wherever the fish was lost, he should return
to that place and he would find Khidr there. He followed the track of the
fish into the sea. Then Musa's servant said to him, <I>"Do you see what has
happened? When we went to find shelter at the rock, I forgot the fish. No
one made me forget to remember it except Shaytan." </I>[Musa said,] <I>"This
is the very thing that we were looking for!" So, following their footsteps,
they retraced their route</I>.(18:63-64) Then they found Khidr. [What happened
further] Allah relates their affair in His Book.'"
<P>
3220. It is relate that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I said to Ibn 'Abbas, "Nawf
al-Bikali claims that Musa, the companion of al-Khidr was not Musa of the
tribe of Israel, but was another Musa.' He said, 'The enemy of Allah has
lied! Ubayy ibn Ka'b related to me from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, &nbsp;"Musa was speaking among the tribe of Israel when
he was asked, 'Which person has the most knowledge.' He said, 'I do.' Allah
rebuked him because he did not ascribe knowledge to Him. He said to him,
'Yes there is - a slave of Mine at the meeting of the two seas knows more
than you.' He said, 'O Lord! Who will let me see him?' (Sufyan said, 'O Lord,
how can I meet him?' He said, 'Take a fish and put it in a basket. When you
lose the fish, he will be there. (He might have said, 'He will be at that
place.') So he took a fish and put it in a basket and then went with his
servant, Yusha' ibn Nun, until they came to the rock and laid down their
heads. Musa slept, and the fish moved and came out and fell into the sea,
<I>'and found its way into the sea in an amazing way.' </I>Allah keep the
water from flowing over the fish and it became like an arch. (He said, 'An
arch like this.') They continued to walk for the rest of the night and the
following day until in the morning he said to his boy, <I>'Bring us our morning
meal. This journey of ours has made us very tired.' </I>Musa did not fell
tired until he has gone beyond the place that Allah had commanded. His boy
said to him, '<I>Do you see what has happened? When we went to find shelter
at the rock, I forgot the fish. No one made me forget to remember it except
Shaytan</I>. It <I>found its way into the sea in an amazing way.'</I> So
the fish had taken a course which had amazed them. Musa said to him, "<I>This
is the very thing that we were looking for!" So, following their footsteps,
they retraced their route</I>' until they reached the rock. There was a man
covered in a garment. Musa greeted him and he returned the greeting and said,
'How is the greeting in your land?' He said, 'I am Musa.' He said, 'Musa
of the tribe of Israel?' He replied, 'Yes, I have come to you so that <I>you
might teach me some of the right guidance which you have been taught.</I>'
He said, 'O Musa, I have a knowledge from the knowledge of Allah which He
has taught me and you do not know, and you have a knowledge from the Allah
of Allah which He has taught you and I do not know,' He asked, <I>'May I
follow you?' </I>He said,<I> 'You will not be able to bear with me. How indeed
could you bear patiently something you have not encompassed in your knowledge?'
Musa said, 'You will find me patient, if Allah wills, and I will not disobey
you in any matter.'</I>
<P>
"''They continued to walk along the seacoast and they passed by a ship. They
asked them to carry them and they recognised al-Khidr and carried them for
free. When they had embarked in the ship, a sparrow came and alighted on
the edge of the ship and dipped its beck into the sea once or twice. Al-Khidr
said to Musa, 'O Musa, my knowledge and your knowledge have only decreased
the knowledge of Allah the like of what this sparrow has decreased the sea
with its beck.' Then he took an axe and removed a plank.'" He said, "Musa
did not notice until he had pulled up the plank with the adze. Musa said
to him, 'What have you done? Some people carry us for free and <I>you stave
it in so that its owners will be drowned? It is truly a dreadful thing that
you have done! He said, 'Did I not say that you would not be able to bear
with me?' He said, 'Do not take me to task because I forgot. Do not demand
of me something too difficult.'</I> So the first was due to forgetfulness
on the part of Musa.
<P>
"'"When they left the sea, they passed by a boy who was playing with the
children. Al-Khidr grabbed his head and plucked it with his hand like this.
(Sufyan made a gesture with the fingers of his hand as if he were plucking
something.) Musa said to him,<I> 'Have you killed a boy who has done no wrong,
without it being in retaliation for someone else? It is truly an appalling
thing that you have done!' He answered, 'Did I not say to you that you would
not be able to bear with me?' He said, 'If I ask you about anything after
this, then you should no longer keep me company. You will have had excuse
enough from me.'</I> So they continued until they reached the inhabitants
of a town. They asked them for food but they refused them hospitality. They
found a wall there about to fall down." He made a gesture with his hand like
this. (Sufyan indicated that he touched his something upwards, and I only
heard Sufayn mention 'about to fall' once.) He said, 'We come to some people
who do not feed us or give us hospitality, and you deliberately go to their
wall. <I>'If you had wanted, you could have taken a wage for that!' He answered,
'This is the parting of the ways between me and you. I will let you know
the explanation of those things about which you were not able to be
patient.'"</I>

than me related it from 'Amr. I heard it from him two or three times, and
I memorised it from him."

crawling on their buttocks, saying, 'A grain in a hair.'"

3223. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Musa was a modest man who covered himself.
He did not show any of his skin out of his modesty. Some of the tribe of
Israel hurt him and said, 'He only covers himself like this because of some
defect on his skin - either leprosy, scrotal hernia or some other defect.
Allah wanted to clear Musa of what they said about him. One day he retired
alone and placed his garment on a stone and then bathed. When he finished,
he went to his clothes to take them, and the stone ran off with it. Musa
took a stick and went after the stone, 'My clothes, O stone! My clothes,
O stone!' until he reached a group of the tribe of Israel and they saw him
naked and the best of what Allah has created and He cleared him of what they
were saying. The stone stopped and he took his clothes and put them on and
began to hit the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has three,
four or five marks from the beating. That is His words,<I> 'O you who believe,
do not be like those who abused Musa. Allah absolved him of what they said
and he was highly honoured with Allah.' </I>(33:69)"

inform the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!' He became angry
so that I could see the anger in his face. Then he said, 'May Allah have
mercy on Musa! He was abused more than this and he was patient.'"

<B>XXXI: The death of Musa and his mention after it</B>
<P>
3226. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The angel of death was sent to
Musa, peace be upon him. When he came, Musa gave him a black eye so he returned
to his Lord and said, 'You sent me to a slave who does not want to die.'
Allah restored his eye and said, "Go back and tell him to put his hand on
the back of an ox and he will live a year for every hair that his hand covers."
Musa said, 'O Lord, then what?' He said, 'Then death.' He said, 'Let it be
now, then.'" He said, "He asked Allah to be brought within a stone's throw
of the Holy Land." Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If I were there, I would show you his
grave beside the road near the red sand-dune.'"
<P>
The like of it is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace.
<P>
3227. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "A Muslim man and a Jewish man
insulted one another. The Muslim said, 'By the One who chose Muhammad over
all the worlds,' in an oath that he made and the Jew said, 'By the One who
chose Musa over all the worlds.' At that, the Muslim raised his hand and
slapped the Jew's face. So the Jew went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and told him about the affair of him and the Muslim.
He said, 'Do not prefer me over Musa. On the Day of Rising, people will faint,
and I will be the first to regain consciousness, and there will be Musa grasping
the Throne. I do not know whether he will be among those who fainted and
came to before me, or if he was one of those that Allah excepted.'"
<P>
3228. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Adam and Musa argued, and Musa said
to him, 'You are Adam whom He expelled from the Garden because of your mistake.'
Adam said, 'You are Musa whom Allah chose for His messages and direct words
and then you blame me for something which was decreed for me before I was
created?'" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said twice, "So Adam overcame Musa in the argument."
<P>
3229. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him

deeds and rescue me from the wrongdoing people.' And Maryam, the daughter
of &Ocirc;Imran, who guarded her chastity and We breathed Our Life Breath
into her and she confirmed the Words of her Lord and His Book and was one
of the obedient."</I> (66:11-12)</B>
<P>
3230. It is related from Abu Musa &#163; that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Many men have been prefect, but
the only perfect women are Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh, and Maryam, daughter
of 'Imran. The excellence of 'A'isha over the women is like the excellence
of tharid* over other types of food."

He said that "<I>dhihri</I>" means that you take a beast of burden with you

heard him and got up and slapped his face. He said, 'Do you say, "By the
One who chose Musa over mankind," when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and

I have protection and a pledge, so what business does so-and-so have in slapping
my face?' He said, 'Did you slap his face?' He mentioned it to him and the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, became angry so that it
could be seen in his face. Then he said, 'Do not make preference between
the Prophets of Allah. The Trumpet will be blown, and everyone who is in
the heavens and everyone who is the earth will swoon, except whomever Allah
wills. Then it will be blown a second time and I will be the first to be
raised. There Musa will be holding to the Throne. I will not known whether
his swooning on the Day of the Mount was enough or whether he was raised

Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him,
"You are the one who said, By Allah, I will fast all day and pray all night
for as long as I live.'?" I replied, "I said that." He said, "You will not
be able to do it. So fast and break the fast, and pray and sleep. Fast three
days of the month and since every good action is multiplied by ten that will
be like fasting all the time." I said, "I can do more than that." He said,
"Then fast one day and break the fast for two days.' I stated, "I can do
more than that." He said, "Then fast one day and break the fast the next.
That is the fast of Da'ud, peace be upon him, and it is the best fast." I
said, "I can do more than that." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "There is nothing better than that.'"

'Yes.' He said, 'If you do that, it will make your eyes weak and your self
tired. Fast for three days of each month. That is fasting the entire year

when a wolf came and took away the child of one of them. She said to her
companion, 'It has taken your child.' The other said, 'On the contrary it
has taken your child.' They took the dispute to Da'ud and he decided on behalf

<P>
3250. It is related from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The excellence of 'A'isha over the
women is like the excellence of <I>tharid</I> over other types of food. Many
men have been prefect, but the only perfect women are Asiya, the wife of
Pharaoh, and Maryam, daughter of 'Imran."
<P>
3251. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "The women of Quraysh are the
best of the women of those who ride camels. They are the most tender to children
and the most careful with their husbands' property.'" Abu Hurayra said after
this, "Maryam bint 'Imran never rode a camel."

<B>XLVII: CHAPTER: </B>
<P>
<I>"O People of the Book! Do not go to excess concerning your deen. Say nothing
but the truth about Allah. The Messiah, 'Isa son of Maryam, was only the
Messenger of Allah and His Word, which He cast into Maryam, and a Spirit
from Him. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. Do not say, 'Three.' It
is better that you stop. Allah is only One God. He is too Glorious to have
a son! Everything in the heavens and everything in the earth belongs to Him.
Allah is enough as a Guardian."</I> (4:171)
<P>
Abu 'Ubayd said that<I> "His word"</I> is "Be" and it is. Someone else said
that <I>"a Spirit from Him"</I> is that He gave him life and gave him a
spirit<I>, "Say not 'Three'".</I>
<P>
3252. It is related from 'Ubada that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Whoever testifies that there is no god but Allah
alone with no partner and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger and that
'Isa is the slave of Allah and His Messenger and a word which He cast into
Maryam and a spirit from Him and that the Garden is real and the Fire is
real will enter the Garden whatever his actions."
<P>
It is related from Junada that he added, "And he can enter by whichever of
the eight doors of the Garden he wishes."

<B>XLVIII: <I>"Mention Maryam in the Book, when she withdrew from her people."
</I>(19:16)</B>
<P>
"<I>Nabadhn&acirc;</I>" (37:145) is "We cast to him". Here it is "she withdrew."
<I>Eastern</I>" to that which is towards the east. "<I>Fa- aj&acirc;'ah&acirc;"
</I>(19:23) is Form IV of <I>j&acirc;'</I>. It is said that it means: "compelled

means far, and "<I>fariyyan</I>" (19:27) means enormous, terrible.

Ibn 'Abbas said that "<I>nisyan</I>" (19:23) is "I was nothing." Someone
else that that it is something insignificant.

<P>
3253. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Only three people talked in their cradles: 'Isa
son of Maryam and a man among the tribe of Israel called Jurayj. His mother
came to him while he was praying and called him. He said, 'Shall I answer
or shall I pray?' She said, 'O Allah, do not let him die without having looked
into the face of a prostitute!' While Jurayj was in his hermitage, a woman
displayed herself to him or spoke to him, but he refused. So she went to
a shepherd and offered herself to him. She gave birth to a child and said,
'It is from Jurayj.' They went to him and demolished his hermitage, forced
him down, and began to abuse him. He did wudu' and prayed and then went to
the child and said, 'Boy, who is your father?' The boy said, 'The shepherd.'
They said, 'We will build you a hermitage of gold.' He said, 'No, only from
clay.' While a child of the tribe of Israel was feeding from its mother,
a man of good appearance passed by riding. She said, 'O Allah, make my son
like this man.' He left the breast and turned to look at the rider and said,
'O Allah, do not make me like him.' Then he turned back to the breast and
began to feed." Abu Hurayra said, "It is as if I could see the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, describing his feeding
by putting his forefinger in his mouth and sucking it." "Then a slavegirl
was brought by and she said, 'O Allah, do not make my son like her!' He stopped
feeding and looked at her and said, 'O Allah, make me like her.' She said,
'Why is that?' He said, "The rider was one of the tyrants and they say that
this slave-girl stole and committed fornication, but she did not do it.'"
<P>
Another <I>isnad</I>.
<P>
3254. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said on the Night he made the Journey, he
said, 'I met Musa,' and he described him, 'There is a man - and I reckon
that he said - a tall man with straight hair, like one of them men Shanu'a,'
and he said, 'I met 'Isa,' and he described him, 'a man of medium height,
reddish complexion, as if he had just come out of bath. I saw Ibrahim, and
I am the one of his descendants who most resembles him. He said, 'Then I
was brought two vessels, one containing milk and the other wine. It was said,
'Drink whichever one you wish.' I took the milk and drank it. It was said,
'You have taken the natural form (or you have got the natural form). If you
had taken the wine, your community would have erred.
<P>
3255. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "I saw 'Isa, Musa and Ibrahim. 'Isa was reddish
with curly hair and a broad chest. As for Musa, he was brown-skinned and
corpulent, with straight hair, as if he were one of the men of az-Zutt."
<P>
3256. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "One day among the people the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned the False Messiah and
said, 'Prophet is not one-eyed, but the False Messiah is one-eyed in the
right eye and his eye looks like a swollen grape. While I was sleeping at
the Ka'ba, I dreamt of a man with brownish skin, like the best brownish skin
among men, and his hair came between his shoulders, and his hair was straight
and water was dripping from his head. He had his hands on the shoulders of
two men, and was doing <I>tawaf</I> of the House. I said, "Who is this?"
They said, "This is the Messiah the son of Maryam." Then behind him I saw
a man with very curly hair and blind in the right eye. He most closely resembled
Ibn Qatan. He had his hands on the shoulders of a man who was doing
<I>tawaf</I> of the House. I said, "Who is this?" They said, "The false
Messiah."'"
<P>
'Ubaydullah corroborated it from Nafi'.
<P>
3257. It is related from Salim that his father said, "No, by Allah. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not say that 'Isa
was reddish, but he said, 'While I was asleep doing tawaf of the Ka'ba, there
was a man with brownish skin and straight hair who was walking between two
men, water dripping from his head, or with water flowing from his head. I
said, "Who is this?" They said, "The son of Maryam." Then I turned around
and there was a reddish corpulent man with curly hair and blind in his right
eye, and his eye was like a swollen grape. I said, "Who is this?" They said,
"This is the Dajjal." The person who most resembles him in Ibn Qatan.'"
<P>
Az-Zuhri said that he was a man of Khuza'a who died in the time of the
<I>Jahiliyya</I>.
<P>
3258. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'I am the closest of people
to the son of Maryam. The Prophets are paternal brothers, and there has been
no Prophet between me and him.'"
<P>
3259. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I am the closest of people to
'Isa son of Maryam in this world and the Next. The Prophets are paternal
brothers. Their mothers vary. but their <I>deen</I> is the same."
<P>
Another isnad from Abu Hurayra who said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said..."
<P>
3260. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "'Isa son of Maryam saw a man stealing and said
to him, 'Have you stolen?' He said, 'No, by Allah whom there is no god but
Him.' 'Isa said, 'I believe in Allah and say my lies lie.'"
<P>
3261. It is related that 'Umar said on the minbar, "I heard the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Do not be excessive in praising
me, as the Christians praised the son of Maryam. I am His slave. Say, "the
slave of Allah and His Messenger."'"
<P>
3262. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When a man teaches his slavegirl
manners and does it well and teaches her and does it well and then sets her
free and marries her, he will have two rewards. When he believes in 'Isa
and then believes in me, he will have two rewards. A slave who fears his
Lord and obeys his masters will have two rewards."
<P>
3263. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas who said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "You will be gathered barefoot,
naked and uncircumcised. Then he recited <I>'As We originated the first creation
so We will regenerate it. It is a promise binding on Us. That is what We
will do.</I>' (21:103) The first of creatures to be clothed on the Day of
Rising will be Ibrahim. Men of my community will be taken to the right and
to the left. I will say, 'My Companions!' and it will be said, 'They never
stopped turning back on their heels from the time you left them.' I will
say the same as the righteous slave, 'Isa son of Maryam said, <I>'I was a
witness against them as long as I remained among them,' </I>to <I>'You are
the Almighty, the All-Wise.' </I>(5:117-118)"
<P>
Qabisa said that they are the apostates who apostasized during the time of
Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr fought them.
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIX: The descent of 'Isa son Maryam, peace be upon them both</B>
<P>
3264. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "By the One who has my soul in His hand,
the time is soon coming when the son of Maryam will descend among you as
a just judge. He will break the crosses, kill the pigs and remove the
<I>jizya</I>-tax. There will be so much money that there will be no takers
for it, and a single prostration will be better than this world and what
it contains." Then Abu Hurayra said, "Recite if you like, <I>'There is not
one of the People of the Book who will not believe in him before he dies;
and on the Day of Rising, he will be a witness against them.' </I>(4:159)"
<P>
3265. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "How will you be when the son of Maryam
descends among you and is your Imam from among you?"
<P>
Al-Awza'i corroborated it.
<P>
<P>
<B>L: What has been mentioned about the Tribe of Israel</B>
<P>
3266. It is related that Rib'i ibn Hirash that 'Uqba ibn 'Amr said to Hudhayfa,
"Will you not relate to me what you heard from the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace?" He said, "I heard him say, 'The Dajjal
will emerge accompanied by water and fire. What appears to the people as
water will in fact be fire that burns, and what appears to the people as
fire will in fact be cold water. Anyone among you who meets him, should plunge
into what appears to him as fire, for it will in fact be cold water.'"
<P>
Hudhayfa said, "There was a man in the people before you to whom the angel
came to take his soul. He was asked, 'Have you done any good?' He said, 'Not
that I know.' He was told, 'Look.' He said, 'I do not know of anything except
that I used to sell to people in this world and I would make allowances for
them. I would give the wealthy time to pay and make allowances for those
in difficulties.' Allah admitted him to the Garden."
<P>
He said, "I heard him say, "There was a man to whom death came and when he
despaired of life, he ordered his family, 'When I am dead, gathered a great
pile of firewood for me and kindle it into a fire until it consumes my flesh
and reches my bones and burns them. Then take them and pulverise them. Then
wait for a windy day and scatter over the sea.' They did that and Allah gathered
him and said to him, 'Why did you do that?' He said, 'Out of fear of You.'
So Allah forgave him."
<P>
'Uqba ibn 'Amr said, "I heard him say that and "he was a grave-robber."
<P>
3267. It is related that 'A'isha and Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was dying, he began pulling
his <I>khamisa</I> (blanket) over his face but when he felt suffocated by
it, he removed it from his face and at that point he said, 'May the curse
of Allah be upon the Jews and the Christians who took the graves of their
Prophets as places of worship.' He was warning against what they had done."
<P>
3268. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The tribe of Israel used to be ruled by the Prophets.
Whenever a Prophet died, another Prophet would succeed him. There is no Prophet
after me, but after me there will be khalifs, and there will be many of them."
They said, "What do you command us?" He said, "Give full allegiance to the
first and then the next and then give them their rights and ask Allah for
that which is due to you. Allah will question them about that which they
were put in charge of."
<P>
3269. It is related from Abu Sa'id that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "You will follow the customs of those before you
hand by hand and arm by arm to such an extent that if they were to go into
the the hole of a lizard, you would go there." We said, "O Messenger of Allah,
is it the Jews and the Christians?" He said, "Who else?"
<P>
3270. It is related that Anas said, "The people mentioned the fire and the
bell, recollecting the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was instructed
to say the phrases of the <I>adhan</I> twice and those of the <I>iqama</I>
once only."
<P>
3271. It is related from 'A'isha that she used to dislike for someone praying
to put his hand on his waist, "Saying the Jews do it."
<P>
Shu'ba corroborated it from al-A'mash.
<P>
3272. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Your term in relation to the term of
the nations which have passed is what is between the 'Asr prayer and sunset.
The example of you, and that of the the Jews and the Christians is like that
of a man who employed some workers. He said, 'Who will work for me until
midday for a qirat each?' The Jews worked until midday for a qirat each.
Then he said, 'Who will work for me from midday to the <I>'Asr </I>prayer
for a qirat each?' Then the Christians worked from midday to the <I>'Asr
</I>prayer for a qirat each. Then he said, 'Who will work for me from <I>'Asr
</I>until sunset for two qirats?' Then you are those who work from the <I>'Asr
</I>prayer to sunset for two qirats each, so you have a double wage. The
Jews and Christians got angry and said, 'We did more work but get less pay!'
He said, 'Have I wronged you at all regarding anything which was due to you?'
They said, 'No.' He said, 'That is my bounty which I give to whomever I wish.'"
<P>
3273. It is related that 'Umar was heard to say, "May Allah fight so-and-so!
Does he not know that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'May Allah curse the Jews! Fat was made unlawful for them
and they melted it and sold it.'" 
<P>
3274. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Transmit from me, even if
it is only an <I>ayat</I>, and you may relate from the tribe of Israel without
harm. Anyone who deliberately tells a lie regarding me will take his seat
in the Fire." 
<P>
3275. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Jews and Christians do not
dye, so do the opposite of them." 
<P>
[This means to dye white hair.]
<P>
3276. It is related from Jundub (in this mosque and we did not forget nor
fear that Jundub would lie) that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Among those before you there was a man with wound who could
not injure the pain and so he took a knife and cut his hand with it, and
the blood did not stop until he died and Allah said, 'My slave hastened his
way to Me, and so I made the Garden unlawful for him.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>The story of the leper, the blind man and bald man among the tribe of
Israel</B>
<P>
3277. It is related from Abu Hurayra that he heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Three of the tribe of Isra'il
were respectively leprous, bald and blind. Allah wanted to put them to the
test and so he sent an angel to them. He came to the leper and said, 'What
would you like best?' He said, 'A good complexion and clear skin and the
thing that I have which makes people find me unclean to be taken from me.'
He wiped him and his impurity left him and he gave him a good complexion.
He asked, 'What property do you like best?' He answered, 'Camels (or he said
'cattle' - the relator is uncertain about the leper and the bald man, for
one of them asked for camels and the other for cattle.)' and he gave him
a pregnant she-camel.' He said, 'May Allah bless you in it.'
<P>
"Then he came to the bald one and asked, 'What would you like best?' He replied,
'A good head of hair and to have what people consider distasteful about me
removed from me.' So he touched him and removed what he had and gave him
good hair. He said, 'What property do you like the best?' He said, 'Cattle,'
so he gave him a pregnant cow and he said, 'May Allah bless you in it.'
<P>
"Then he went to the blind man and asked, 'What would you like best?' He
answered, 'That Allah return my sight to me so that I can see people.' He
touched him and Allah returned his sight to him. He said, 'What property
do you like the best?' He replied, 'Sheep,' and he gave him a pregnant sheep.
<P>
"These animals all gave birth and produced offspring. The one had a valley
full of camels, the other a valley full of cattle and the other a valley
full of sheep.
<P>
"Then he went to the leper in his own form and appearance and said, 'I am
a poor man who has lost his means on his journey. Today I can seek none but
Allah and then you. I ask you, by the One who gave you a good complexion
and good skin and property, for a camel so that I can complete my journey.'
He said, 'I have many obligations.' He said, 'I seem to recognise you. Were
you not a leper, that people found unclean, and poor and then Allah was generous
to you?' He said, 'I inherited this property, elder son from elder son.'
He said, 'If you are a liar in your claim, may Allah return you as you were!'
<P>
"He went to the bald man in his own form and appearance and said to him the
same as he had said to the other and he replied to him in the same way. He
said, 'If you are a liar, may Allah return you as you were!'
<P>
"Then he went to the blind man in his own form and appearance and said to
him, 'I am a poor man who has lost his means on his journey. Today I can
seek none but Allah and then you. I ask you by the One who returned your
sight to you for a sheep so I can complete my journey.' He said, 'I was blind
and Allah restored my sight to me, and poor and Allah ennriched me, so take
what you want and leave what you want. By Allah, I will not be hard on you
today about anything which you take for Allah, the Mighty and Exalted.' He
said, 'Keep your property. You have been tested and Allah is pleased with
you and angry with your companions.'"

<B>LI: <I>"Do you consider that the Companions of the Cave and Ar-Raqim"
</I>(18:9)</B>
<P>
<B> </B>The cave is the opening in the mountains and the raqim is the Book.
"<I>Marqum</I>" (83:9) means written, coming from <I>raqm</I>. <I>"We fortified
their hearts</I>" (18:14) is "We inspired them to be steadfast".
"<I>Shatat</I>" (18:14) is excessive. "<I>Wasid</I>" (18:18) is the courtyard,
and its plural is <I>was&acirc;'id</I> and <I>wusud</I>, and one says the
"<I>threshold</I>" of the door. "<I>Mu'sada</I>" (90:20 and 104:8) is
encompassing. There is <I>"to close the door" </I>(<I>&acirc;sada, awsada</I>).
<I>"We raised them up</I>" (18:19) is We brought them to life, and
"<I>azka</I>" means the most abundant. Allah sealed their ears (18:11) and

Mujahid said that "<I>taqriduhum</I>" (18:17) means to leave them.

<P>
<B>Story of the Cave</B>
<P>
3278. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "While three people of those before
you were walking, they were caught by the rain and took shelter in a cave
in the mountain and they were blocked in. They said to one another, 'Only
truthfulness will save you. Let each man of you supplicate by what he has
done and was sincere in doing.'
<P>
One of them said, 'O Allah, You know that I hired a worker to do some work
for me for a <I>faraq</I> of rice. He went off and left it. I took that faraq
and sowed it and from that I purchased cows. He came to me to ask for his
wage and I said, "Go to those cattle and drive them off." He said to me,
"But I am only owed a faraq of rice from you." I said, "Go to those cattle.
They have come from that <I>faraq</I>." So he drove them off. If you know
that I did that out of fear of You, then make an opening for us!' The rock
made an opening for them.
<P>
"The second said, 'O Allah, YOu know that I have two aged parents and every
night I used to bring them the milk of my sheep. One night I was delayed
and when I came they had gone to slee, and my wife and children were crying
from hunger. I used to not let them drink until my parents had drunk. I disliked
to wake them up and I disliked to leave them without their drink. I continued
to wait until dawn broke. If you know that I did that out of fear of You,
then make an opening for us!' The rock opened for them so that they saw the
sky.'
<P>
"The other said, 'O Allah, You know that I had a niece who was the most beloved
of people to me. I tried to seduce her and she refused me unless I brought
her a hundred dinars. I looked for them until I had them and then I brought
them to her and gave them to her, and she gave herself to me. When I was
between her legs, she said, "Fear Allah and do not deflower without right,"
so I got up and left the hundred dinars. If you know that I did that out
of fear of You, then make an opening for us!' and it opened and they went
out."
<P>
3279. It is related from Abu Hurayra that he heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "While a woman was suckling
her child, a rider passed by her and she liked him. She said, 'O Allah, do
not let my son die until he is like this one.' He said, 'O Allah, do not
make me like him.' Then he turned back to the breast and a slave-girl passed
by who was being pulled and abused. She said, 'O Allah, do not make my son
like her!' He said, 'O Allah, make me like her.' He said, 'The rider was
an unbeliever and said to the slave-girl, "You committed fornication," and
she said, "Allah is enough for me." They said, "You stole," and she said,
"Allah is enough for me."'"
<P>
3280. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace,said, "While a dog was going around a well and about
to die of thirst, one of the prostitutes of the tribe of Israel saw it and
removed her shoe and gave it water. She was forgiven on account of that."
<P>
<A HREF="muw19.html#h2">3281</A>. It is related from Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman
that he heard Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan on the minbar in the year when he went
on <I>hajj</I>. He took a lock of hair which was in the hand of a guard and
said, 'O people of Madina! Where are your men of knowledge? I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbid the like of this
and say, "The tribe of Israel were destroyed when their women adopted it."'"
<P>
3282. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "In the nations who passed away before you there
were people who were moved to what is correct (by Allah). If there was to
be such a man among my community, it would be 'Umar ibn al-Khattab." 
<P>
3283. It is related from Abu Sa'id that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Among the tribe of Israel was a man who had killed
ninety-nine people. Then he went out to ask about [repentance]. He went to
a monk and asked him and he said to him, 'Is there any repentance?' He said,
'No,' so he killed him. He continued to ask and a man said to him, 'Go to
such-and-such a town.' Then death overtook him, and he turned his chest in
its direction. The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment argued about
him. Allah revealed to this village to come near and that village to go further
from him. He said, 'Measure the distance between them, and he was a hand-span
nearer to this village, and so He forgave him."
<P>
3284. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, prayed the <I>Subh</I> prayer and then turned
towards the people and said, "While a man was driving a cow, he mounted it
and hit it. It said, 'We was not created for this. We was created for
ploughing.'" The people said, "Glory be to Allah! A cow that speaks!" He
said, "I, Abu Bakr and 'Umar - they were not there - believe it. While a
man was with his sheep, a wolf attacked and went off with one of the sheep,
and he went after it until he rescued it from the wolf. The wolf said this
to him, 'You have rescued it from me, but who will guard it on the day of
wild beasts, the day when they will have no shepherd but me?'" The people
said, "Glory be to Allah! A wolf that speaks!" He said, "I, Abu Bakr and
'Umar believe it," although they were not there.

The like of it is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace.

bless him and grant him peace, said, "A man bought some land from another
man and the one who had purchased the land found a jar containing some gold
in his land. He said to the one who had sold the land, 'Take your gold. I
bought the land from you but I did not buy the gold.' The one who had owned
the land said, 'I sold you the land and what it contains.' So they took the
argument to a man and the one to whom they took it said, 'Do either of you
have a child?' One of them said, 'I have a son,' and the other said, 'I have
a daughter.' He said, 'Marry the boy to the girl and spend on them out of
it and give <I>sadaqa</I>.'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw17.html#m23">3286</A>. It is related from Usama ibn Zayd was
asked, "What did you hear from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, regarding the plague?" Usama said, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'The plague is a
punishment which was sent against a group of the tribe of Israel - or against
those before you. So if you hear that it exists in a land, then you do not
go it. If it occurs in a land where you are, then do you leave, fleeing from
it.'" Abu'n-Nadr said, "Do not let it force you to leave only in flight from
it."
<P>
3287. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "I asked
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about the
plague and he informed me that it is 'a punishment which Allah sends against
whomever He will. Allah has made it a mercy for the believers. There is no
one who is where the plague occurs and who remains in his land with steadfastness
and in expectation of the reward, knowing that only what Allah has written
for him will befall him, but that he has the like of the reward of the martyr.'"
<P>
3288. It is related from 'A'isha that Quraysh were concerned with the case
of a Makhzumi woman who had stolen something and they said, "Who will speak
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about
her?" They said, "Who is bold enough to do it except Usama ibn Zayd, the
beloved of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?"
Usama spoke to him and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "How can you intercede when it is a case of one of the legal
punishments of Allah Almighty?" Then he stood up and spoke and said, "Those
before you were destroyed because when a noble among them stole, they let
him be, but when the weak among them stole, they carried out the legal punishment
on them. By Allah, if Fatima the daughter of Muhammad were to steal, I would
cut off her hand."
<P>
3289. It is related that Ibn Mas'ud said, "I heard a man reciting an
<I>ayat</I> when I had heard it differently from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. So I brought him to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and informed him. I recognised dislike
in his face, and he said, 'Both of you act well. Do not disagree. Those before
you disagreed and perished.'"
<P>
3290. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "It is as if I could visualise the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recounting about one of
the Prophets whose people had beaten him and made him bleed. While the blood
was running down his face, he was saying, 'O Allah, forgive my people! They
do not know.'"
<P>
3291. It is related from Abu Sa'id from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, "A man of those before you was given wealth by Allah.
When he was near death, he said to his sons, 'What kind of father have I
been to you?' They replied, 'An excellent father.' He said, 'I have never
done any good at all. When I die, burn me and then pulverise me and then
scatter me on a windy day.' They did so and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic,
gathered him and said, 'What moved you to it?' He said, 'Fear of you,' so
He granted him His mercy."
<P>
It is related from Abu Sa'id from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
3292. It is related that Rib'i ibn Hirash that 'Uqba ibn 'Amr said to Hudhayfa,
"Will you not relate to me what you heard from the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace?" He said, "I heard him say, 'There was
a man to whom death came and when he despaired of life, he ordered his family,
'When I am dead, gathered a great pile of firewood for me and kindle it into
a fire until it consumes my flesh and reaches my bones, then take them and
pulverise them and scatter me on a hot - or windy - day over the sea.' Allah
gathered him and said to him, 'Why did you do that?' He said, 'Out of fear
of You.' So Allah forgave him."
<P>
'Uqba said, "I heard him say..."
<P>
It is related from 'Abdu'l-Malik, "on a windy day."
<P>
3293. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There was a man who used to lend to
people. He would say to his servant, 'When you come to someone in difficulties,
make allowances for him, so that perhaps Allah will make allowances for us.'
So he met Allah and He made allowances for him."
<P>
3294. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There was a man who was excessive (in evil deeds)
and when death came to him, he said to his sons, 'When I die, burn me and
pulverise me and then scatter me to the wind. By Allah, if my Lord should
get hold of me, He will punish me with a punishment more severe than that
He has inflicted on anyone. When he died, that was done to him. So Allah
commanded the earth, saying, 'Gather up what is in you of him,' and it did
it. Then he was standing there and He said, 'What moved you to do what you
did?' He said, 'O Lord, Your fear!' So He forgave him."
<P>
Someone else said, "Fear of you, O Lord!"
<P>
3295. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A woman was punished for
a cat which she shut up until it died. She entered the Fire because of it.
She did not feed it nor give it water when she shut it up nor did she let
it loose to eat from the insects of the earth.'"
<P>
3296. It is related that Abu Mas'ud 'Uqba said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Part of what people have of the words
of earlier prophethood is: if it does not make you ashamed, do what you wish."
<P>
It is related from Abu Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Part of what people have of the words of earlier prophethood
is: provided it does not make you feel shame, do whatever you wish."
<P>
3297. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "While a man was dragging his wrapper out of arrogance,
the earth swallow him up and he will go on sinking into the earth until the
Day of Rising."
<P>
3298. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "We are the last but will be the first on the
Day of Rising, in spite of the fact that others were given the Book before
us and we were given it after them. This is the day about which they disagreed.
The Jews have tomorrow and the Christians the day after. It is a duty for
every Muslim to do <I>ghusl</I> once every seven days in the course of which
he should wash his head and his body."
<P>
3299. It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan
came to Madina on the last time he came to it and he gave a speech and produced
a hank of hair and said, 'I did not think that anyone except the Jews would
do this. The Prophet* called it a 'lie", meaning joined on false hair."
<P>
Ghundar corroborated it from Shu'ba.
