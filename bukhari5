<B>I: How the prayer was made obligatory during the Night Journey</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that Abu Sufyan was relating to him the hadith of Heraclius
and said, "He, i.e. the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prescribed for us the prayer, <I>sadaqa</I> and chastity."
<P>
342. Abu Dharr related that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, &nbsp;said, "During the time that I was in Makka, the roof
of my house was opened up and Jibril descended and opened up my breast, washing
it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a gold basin filled with wisdom and
belief. He poured it into my breast and then closed it. Then he took my hand
and took me up to the lowest heaven. When I reached the lowest heaven, Jibril
said to the keeper of the heaven, 'Open!' He said, 'Who is this?' He said,
'This is Jibril.' He asked, 'Is anyone with you?' He said, 'Yes, Muhammad,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is with me.' He said, 'Has he been
sent for?' He said, 'Yes.'
<P>
"When the way opened we climbed above the lowest heaven and found a man sitting
there, with people on his right and people on his left. When he looked to
his right, he laughed, and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said,
'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet and virtuous son.' I said to Jibril, 'Who
is this?' He said, 'This is Adam and these people on his right and his left
are the souls of his descendants. The people on the right are the people
of the Garden and the people who are on his left are the people of the Fire.
When he looks to his right, he laughs and when he looks to his left, he weeps.'
Then he took me up to the second heaven and said to its keeper, 'Open.' Its
keeper said to him the same as the first one had said and then made the way
open."
<P>
Anas said that he (the Prophet) mentioned that in the heavens he found Adam,
Idris, Musa, 'Isa, and Ibrahim, blessings be upon them. He did not specify
their positions, except for mentioning that he found Adam in the lowest heaven
and Ibrahim in the sixth heaven.
<P>
Anas said, "When Jibril together with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, passed by Idris, he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet
and virtuous brother!' I said, 'Who is this?' He said, 'This is Idris.' Then
I passed by Musa and he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet and virtuous
brother!' I said, 'Who is this?' He said, 'This is Musa.' Then I passed by
'Isa and he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous brother and virtuous Prophet!'
I said, 'Who is this?' He said, 'This is 'Isa.' Then I passed by Ibrahim
and he said, 'Welcome to the virtuous Prophet and virtuous son!' I said,
'Who is this?' He said, 'This is Ibrahim, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace.'"
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"Then I was taken up until I appeared on a high plateau where I heard the
scratching of pens."
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t9">343</A>. Ibn Hazm and Anas ibn Malik said that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah prescribed
fifty prayers for my community and I returned with that until I passed by
Musa. He said, 'What has Allah prescribed to you for your community?' I said,
'He has prescribed fifty prayers.`" He said, 'Go back to your Lord. Your
community will not be able to manage that.' He made me go back and He reduced
it to half. Then I returned to Musa and I said, 'He reduced them to half.'
He said, 'Go back to your Lord. Your community will not be able to manage
that.' I returned and He halved them again and I returned to him. He said,
'Go back to your Lord. Your community will not be able to manage that.' I
returned to Him and He said, "'They are five and they are fifty. My word
does not change.' I went back to Musa and he said, 'Return to your Lord.
I said, 'I am too embarassed before my Lord.' Then he took me on until he
brought me to the Lote-tree of the Boundary which was covered in colours
which I did not recognise. Then I was brought into the Garden and in it were
strings of pearls and its earth was made of musk."
<P>
It is related that 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin, said, "When Allah made the prayer
obligatory, it was only two <I>rak'ats </I>whether resident or travelling.
Then the travelling prayer was kept the same but the residential prayer was
increased."

Someone praying while wrapped in a single cloth.
<P>
It is mentioned from Salama ibn al-Akwa' that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "He should fasten it, even with only a thorn."
The <I>isnad</I> needs to be studied.
<P>
Someone praying in the same garment in which he has had sexual intercourse
if he does not see any impurity on it. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, commmanded, "<I>Tawaf</I> of the House must not be done
naked."
<P>
344. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said, "We were ordered to bring out the
menstruating women and veiled women on the days of the two festivals. They
would be present at the assemblies of the Muslims and their feasts, but
menstruating women would stay away from the place of prayer. A woman said,
'Messenger of Allah, what if one of us does not have a veil?' He said, 'Her
friend should share her veil with her.'"
<P>
Muhammad ibn Sirin related that Umm 'Atiyya related that she heard this from
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

wrapper which he tied round his neck, while his clothes were hanging on a

garments in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?'"

say, "I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, in the year of the Conquest of Makka and found him doing ghusl, with
his daughter Fatima screening him. I greeted him and he asked, 'Who is this?'
I said, 'It is Umm Hani' bint Abi Talib.' He said, 'Welcome, Umm Hani'.'
When he finished his <I>ghusl</I>, he stood up and prayed eight
<I>rak'ats</I> wrapped in a single cloth. When he finished, I said, 'Messenger
of Allah, my brother claims that he is going to kill a man to whom I have
given protection. It is so-and-so, the son of Hubayra.' The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'We give protection to the one
to whom you have given protection, Umm Hani'.'"
<P>
Umm Hani' said that that happened in the morning.
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#j31">351</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that someone

<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#j35">354</A>. It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Harith said,
"We asked Jabir ibn 'Abdullah about praying in a single cloth. He said, 'I
went out with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on one
of his journeys. One night I went to him for some reason and found him praying.
I was wearing a single garment. I wrapped myself in it and prayed beside
him. When he finished, he said, 'What is your purpose, Jabir?' I told him
what I wanted and when I had concluded, he said, 'What is this covering business
I saw you do?' I said, 'I was wearing a single cloth.' He said, 'If it is
wide enough, wrap yourself in it, but if it is narrow then use it as a
waist-wrapper.'"
<P>
355. It is related that Sahl said, "Some men used to pray with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with their wrappers tied around
their necks like boys do. The women were told not to raise their heads until
the men were sitting up straight."

356. It is related that al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said, "Once when I was with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey he said,
'Mughira, hold this small container of water for me.' I took it and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on until he disappeared
from my sight and relieved himself. He was wearing a Syrian cloak. He tried
to extend his arm out through the sleeve, but it was tight, so he pulled
his arm out from underneath it. I poured for him and he did<I> wudu' </I>for
the prayer, wiping over his leather socks, and then prayed.
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The undesirability of being naked in the prayer and elsewhere</B>
<P>
357. Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to relate that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was carrying stones with them for
the Ka'ba. He was wearing a waist-wrapper. His uncle, al-'Abbas, said to
him, 'Nephew, will you take off your wrapper and put it on your shoulders
underneath the stones?' He removed his wrapper and put it onto his shoulders
and then fell unconscious. After that he was never seen naked."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Praying in a shirt, trousers, knee-length shorts and qaba' (outer
garment with long sleeves)</B>
<P>
358. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man came to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and asked about praying in a single
garment. He said, 'Do all of you have two garments?' Then a man asked 'Umar
who said, 'When Allah enriches you, then expend more. A man should combine
his garments A man can pray in a waist-wrapper and cloak (<I>rida'</I>),
in a wrapper and a shirt, in a wrapper and <I>qaba'</I>, in trousers and
a cloak, in trousers and a shirt, in trousers and a qaba', in long shorts
and a <I>qaba'</I>, and in long shorts and a shirt.'"
<P>
He said, "I think he also said "in long shorts and a cloak."
<P>
359. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "A man asked the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'What should someone in ihram wear?'
He said, 'He should not wear a shirt, trousers, burnoose or clothes coloured
with saffron or wars (a yellow dye). If someone cannot find any sandals,
he can wear leather socks but cut short so that they come below the ankles.'"
<P>
Nafi' reports the same from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: What should be used to cover private parts</B>
<P>
360. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the <I>samma' </I>style
of wrapping (wrapping yourself in a garment in such a way that you cannot
put your hands out) and a man wearing a single cloth sitting with his legs
drawn up when none of it was covering his private parts.
<P>
361. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet forbade two kinds
of sales: <I>limas</I> (a sale which is concluded when an article is touched)
and <I>nibadh</I> (when an article is thrown to a buyer) and th<I>e samma'</I>
style of wrapping and a man sitting with his legs drawn up in a single garment."
<P>
362. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "On that hajj Abu Bakr sent me
with the callers on the Day of Sacrifice. At Mina we called out, 'No pagan
is to make the <I>hajj</I> after this year and no one is to do <I>tawaf</I>
of the House naked.'"
<P>
Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, "Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, sent 'Ali out and commanded him to call out <I>Surat
Bara'a </I>(i.e. <I>Surat at-Tawba </I>(9))."
<P>
Abu Hurayra said, "'Ali called out with us on the Day of Sacrifice to the
people at Mina, 'No pagan is to make the <I>hajj</I> after this year and
no one is to do tawaf of the house naked.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Praying without a cloak</B>
<P>
363. It is related that Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said, "I came upon Jabir
ibn 'Abdullah when he was praying in a garment which was wrapped about him.
His cloak had been laid aside. When he finished, we said, 'Abu 'Abdullah!
Do you pray with your cloak lying there at your side?' He said, 'Yes, I wanted
ignorant people like you to see me. I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, praying like that.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: What is said about the thigh</B>
<P>
It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, Jarhad and Muhammad ibn Jahsh from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"The thigh is one of the private
parts." Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
uncovered his thigh." The <I>hadith</I> of Anas is stronger, but the
<I>hadith</I> of Jarhad is more complete in order to resolve the disagreement
of the scholars .Abu Musa said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, covered his knees when 'Uthman entered." Zayd ibn Thabit said,
"Allah sent down revelation on His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, while his thigh was resting on my thigh and it became so heavy
that I was afraid that it would bruise my thigh."
<P>
364. It is related from Anas, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, raided Khaybar and we prayed the Morning Prayer there
when it was still dark. The Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, mounted, Abu Talha mounted, and I followed behind Abu Talha. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rode quickly through the
lane of Khaybar and my knee touched the thigh of the Prophet of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace. He had removed the wrapper from his
thigh so that I could see the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When he entered the town, he said,
'Allah is greater! Khaybar is ruined. When we alight in the courtyard of
a people, it is an evil morning for those who have been warned.' He said
this three times. The people came out for their jobs and said, 'Muhammad!'"
<P>
'Abdu'l-'Aziz said, "Some of our companions said, 'and the army."
<P>
Anas said, "We took it by force and the captives were rounded up. Dihya came
and said, 'Prophet of Allah! Give me a slavegirl from the captives.' He said,
'Go and take a slavegirl.' He took Safiyya bint Huyayy. A man came to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Prophet of Allah,
you have given Dihya Safiyya bint Huyayy, the mistress of Qurayza and an-Nadir.
She is suitable for none but you.' He said, 'Tell him to bring her.' He brought
her and when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked
at her, he said, 'Take a slavegirl from the captives other than this one.'
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set her free and married
her."
<P>
Thabit said to him, "O Abu Hamza, what was her bride-price?" He said, "Herself
He set her free and married her. When they were on the way back, Umm Sulaym
decked her out for him and sent her to him as a bride in the night. So the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up in the morning as
a bridegroom and said, 'If anyone has anything, he should bring it.' He spread
out a leather mat and one man brought dates while someone else brought ghee
- I think that he also mentioned sawiq (mash from wheat or barley) - They
made hays and that was the wedding feast of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: How much a woman should wear when praying</B>
<P>
'Ikrima said, "If she can cover her body with a single garment, that is enough."
<P>
365. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, would pray the <I>Fajr</I> prayer and some
of the believing women used to be present with him, wrapped up in their garments
and then they would return to their homes without anyone recognising them."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: When someone prays in a patterned garment and looks at the pattern</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#72">366</A>. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed in a long shirt which had
a pattern on it and glanced once at the pattern. When he finished, he said,
"Take this shirt of mine to Abu Jahm and bring me Abu Jahm's anbijaniyya
[a garment without any pattern on it." It has just distracted me from my
prayer."
<P>
It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "I was looking at its pattern while I was praying and I
was afraid it might distract me."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: If a person prays in a garment with a cross or pictures on it, does
that invalidate his prayer? What is forbidden in that respect</B>
<P>
367. It is related from Anas that 'A'isha had a thin patterned curtain which
she used to screen off one side of her room. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Remove this curtain of yours from our sight.
Its pictures keep appearing in my prayer."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Someone praying in a silk garment and then removing it</B>
<P>
368. It is related that 'Uqba ibn 'Amir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was given a silk garment and put it on and prayed
in it. When he finished, he wrenched it off violently as if it was hateful
to him and said, 'This is not appropriate for those who fear Allah.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Praying in a red garment</B>
<P>
369. It is related from Abu Juhayfa that his father said, "I saw the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in a red leather tent
and I saw Bilal take the left-over <I>wudu'</I> water of the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. I saw the people racing one
another to get that <I>wudu</I>' water. Anyone who managed to get some of
it would rub it on himself and those who did not get any of it would take
some of the moisture from the hands of their friends. Then I saw Bilal take
a short spear and plant it firmly in the ground. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came out wearing a gathered-up red robe, and, with
the spear in front of him, led the people in prayer. I saw people and animals
passing in front of the spear."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Praying on the roof, on the minbar and on wood</B>
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "Al-Hasan saw nothing wrong in praying on ice or on bridges,
even if there was urine flowing under them or over or in front of them provided
there was a <I>sutra</I> between him and it." Abu Hurayra prayed on the roof
of the mosque following the Imam's prayer and Ibn 'Umar prayed on snow.
<P>
370. It is related that Abu Hazim said, "They asked Sahl ibn Sa'd, 'What
was the minbar made out of?' He said, 'No one is left who knows that better
than I do. It was made of tamarisk from al-Ghaba. So-and-so, the <I>mawla</I>
of so-and-so, made it for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and when it had been made and put in place the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood on it, faced the
<I>qibla</I> and said, "Allah is greater." The people stood behind him. He
recited and bowed and the people bowed behind him. Then he raised his head
and stepped down and prostrated on the ground. Then he returned to the minbar
and bowed again and raised his head. Then he stepped back down to prostrate
on the ground. This is what I know about it."
<P>
'Ali ibn 'Abdullah said that Ahmad ibn Hanbal asked him about this
<I>hadith</I>. He said, "I meant that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was higher than the people, so, according to this
<I>hadith</I>, there is no harm in the Imam being higher than the people."
I said, "Sufyan ibn 'Uyayna used to be asked about this a lot, so did you
not hear it from him?" He said, "No."
<P>
371. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, fell off his horse and his leg or shoulder
was scraped. He swore to stay away from his wives for a month and he stayed
in an attic room of his which had stairs made of palm trunks. His Companions
came to visit him and he prayed with them sitting while they stood up. When
he gave the salam, he said, 'The Imam is to be followed. So when he says
the <I>takbir</I>, you say the <I>takbir</I>. When he bows, you bow. When
he prostrates, you prostrate. If he prays standing you pray standing.' He
came down after twenty-nine days. They said, 'Messenger of Allah, you swore
that you would not go to your wives for a month.' He said, 'The month is
twenty-nine days.'"

prostrates</B>

menstruating. Sometimes his garment would touch me when he prostrated." She
continued, "He used to pray on a small mat."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Praying on a straw mat</B>
<P>
Jabir and Abu Sa'id prayed standing up in a boat. Al-Hasan said, "You can
pray standing as long as it does not cause hardship to your companions and
you turn with the ship. Otherwise you should pray sitting down."
<P>
373. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that his grandmother, Mulayka, invited
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for some
food which she had prepared for him. He ate some of it and then said, "Get
up. I will lead you in prayer." Anas said, "I went to fetch our mat which
had become black from long use and I sprinkled it with water. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood on it and the orphan
and I lined up behind him and the old woman stood behind us. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed two <I>rak'ats</I>
with us and then left.
<P>

Allah bless him and grant him peace, and some of us would prostrate on our
clothes."
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#2">375</A>. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the
Prophet, said. "I used to sleep directly in front of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and my legs were in his
<I>qibla</I>. When he prostrated, he would nudge me and I would pull up my
legs. When he stood up, I stretched them out again." She added, "In those
days there were no lamps in the houses."
<P>
376. It is related from 'Urwa that 'A'isha informed him that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray with her
stretched out on the family bed between him and the <I>qibla</I> like a corpse
at a funeral.
<P>
377. It is related from 'Urwa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, used to pray with 'A'isha lying between him and the <I>qibla</I>
on the bed on which they slept.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: Prostrating on a garment when it is very hot</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "People used to prostrate on their turbans and head coverings
with their hands in their sleeves."
<P>
378. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We used to pray with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and some of us would put down the
ends of our garments in the place we were going to prostrate because of the
intense heat."

urinating. Then he did <I>wudu'</I>, wiping over his leather socks. Then
he stood up and prayed. He was asked about this and said, 'I saw the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do the same as this.'"

the last of those who became Muslim.

<I>qibla</I></B>
<P>
Abu Humayd mentioned that from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
384. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever prays our prayer
and faces our <I>qibla</I> and eats what we slaughter, he is a Muslim and
is under the protection of Allah and the protection of His Messenger. Do
not act treacherously against Allah with respect to those under His protection."
<P>
385. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I am commanded to fight people
until they say, 'There is no god but Allah.' When they say this and pray
our prayer, face our <I>qibla</I> and slaughter as we slaughter, then their
blood and property are forbidden to us unless we have a right to them and
their reckoning is up to Allah."
<P>
Related with a different <I>isnad</I> from Anas.
<P>
Maymun ibn Siyah related that he asked Anas ibn Malik, "Abu Hamza, what makes
people's blood and property unlawful?" He replied, "Anyone who testifies
that there is no god but Allah, faces our <I>qibla</I>, prays our prayer
and eats what we slaughter is a Muslim. He is owed what is owed to any Muslim
and has the same obligations as any other Muslim."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The qibla of the people of Madina, the people of Syria and the East</B>
<P>
There is no qibla to the east or west based on the statement of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Do not face the qibla while defecating
or urinating, but face east or west."
<P>
386. It is related from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "When you defecate, do not face the
<I>qibla</I> nor turn your back to it. Rather face the west or the east."
Abu Ayyub said, "We went to Syria and found lavatories which had been built
facing the <I>qibla</I>. We turned at an angle and asked Allah's forgiveness."
<P>
It is related that 'Ata' heard the same from Abu Ayyub from the Prophet.

who does <I>tawaf</I> around the Ka'ba for <I>'umra </I>but has not done
<I>tawaf</I> between Safa and Marwa can have sexual intercourse with his
wife. He said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came
and did <I>tawaf</I> of the House seven times and prayed two <I>rak'ats
</I>behind the Maqam and then did <I>tawaf</I> between Safa and Marwa. "You
have an excellent example in the Messenger of Allah".' We asked Jabir ibn
'Abdullah and he said, 'He should not approach her until he has done
<I>tawaf</I> between Safa and Marwa."
<P>
388. It is related that Mujahid said, "Someone came to Ibn 'Umar and told
him, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has
just entered the Ka'ba.' Ibn 'Umar said, 'I arrived to find that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had already left, but I found Bilal
standing between the two doors. I asked Bilal saying, "Did the Prophet pray
in the Ka'ba?" He said, "Yes, two <I>rak'ats</I> between the two pillars
on the left as you enter. Then he came out and prayed two <I>rak'ats</I>
facing the Ka'ba."'"
<P>
389. Ibn 'Abbas was heard to say, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, entered the House, he made supplication in each of its
corners and did not pray until he had come out of it. When he came out, he
did two<I> rak'ats </I>facing the Ka'ba and stated, 'This is the
<I>qibla</I>.'"

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed towards Jerusalem for sixteen
or seventeen months although the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, would have liked to face the Ka'ba. Then Allah revealed,
<I>'We have seen you looking up into heaven, turning this way and that...'
</I>(2:144) so he turned to face towards the Ka'ba and the foolish people
- in other words the Jews - said, <I>&nbsp;'What has made them turn around
from the direction they used to face?' Say:"Both East and West belong to
Allah. He guides whoever He wills to a straight path."</I>' A man prayed
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then went
out after he had prayed and passed by some of the Ansar who were doing the<I>
'Asr </I>prayer facing Jerusalem. He said that he testified that he had prayed
with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, facing
towards the Ka'ba. So the people turned right round so that they were facing
towards the Ka'ba."
<P>
391. It is related that Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray on his mount whichever way it turned but when
he wanted to do the obligatory prayer, he would dismount and face the
<I>qibla</I>."
<P>
392. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, prayed. - (Ibrahim said, "I do not know whether he added
to it or did less.") - After he had said the <I>salam</I>, someone asked,
'Messenger of Allah, is there something new in the prayer?' He said, 'What
new thing?' They said, 'You prayed such-and-such.' He turned his feet, faced
the <I>qibla</I>, did two prostrations and then said the <I>salam</I>. When
he turned to face us, he said, 'If there had been something new in the prayer,
I would have informed you about it, but I am a human being like yourselves
and I forget as you forget. So if I forget, remind me. If anyone has any
doubt about his prayer, he should build on what he knows to be right and
complete it on that basis. Then he should say the <I>salam</I> and then do
two prostrations.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: What has come about the qibla. Someone who did not think that the prayer
should be repeated if a person inadvertantly prays to other than to the
qibla.</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the <I>salam</I>
after two <I>rak'ats</I> of <I>Dhuhr</I> and turned to face the people and
then completed the rest.
<P>
393. It is related that 'Umar said, "My Lord agreed with me regarding three
things. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, if only we could take the Maqam of Ibrahim
as a place of prayer,' and it was revealed, <I>"Take the Station of Ibrahim
as a place of prayer." </I>Regarding the <I>ayat</I> of the veil, I said,
'Messenger of Allah, I wish you would order your wives to veil themselves
because both pious and corrupt men speak to them,' and the <I>ayat</I> of
veiling (33:59) was revealed. The wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, once banded together against him and I said to them,
'Perhaps his Lord will give him better wives than you if he divorces you,'
and the verse regarding this was revealed." (66:5)
<P>
394. Anas was heard to relate this.
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#q6">395</A>. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said,
"While the people were performing the <I>Subh</I> prayer at Quba', someone
came to them and said, 'In the night some Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was commanded to
face the Ka'ba, so face it.' They had been facing Syria and so they turned
around towards the Ka'ba."
<P>
396. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, once prayed five <I>rak'ats</I> for <I>Dhuhr</I> and
they said, 'Has there been an increase in the prayer?' He said, 'What increase?'
They said, 'You prayed five <I>rak'ats</I>.' He turned his feet and performed
two prostrations."

and 'Aqil.'' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

the water flows in the river bed between me and them so that I am unable
to get to their mosque and lead them in the prayer. Messenger of Allah, I
would very much like you to come and pray in my house so that I could take
it as a prayer-place." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant

Messenger.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

but Allah," desiring by that only the face of Allah?' The man said, 'Allah
and His Messenger know best,' adding, 'We have seen him going off with and

he sent for the Banu'n-Najjar who came with their swords girded on. It is
as if I could see them now, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, on his camel and Abu Bakr riding behind him with the Banu'n-Najjar
all gathered around him, continuing until he arrived at the courtyard of
Abu Ayyub. He liked to pray wherever he was when the prayer time came. He
would even pray in sheepfolds. He ordered the mosque to be built and sent

this walled garden of yours.' They said, 'No, by Allah! We ask for no payment
except from Allah!"

be levelled and the palm-trees to be cut down. The palm trunks were lined
up to form the mosque's <I>qibla</I> and its two sides walls were made of
stone. They used to recite rhyming verses while carrying the stones. And
the Prophet was with them saying:

graves of their Prophets as places of worship.' He was warning against what
they had done."

of their girls once went out wearing a red leather jewelled scarf She put
it down or it fell off and a kite flew by it as it was lying there and, thinking
it was meat, made off with it. They looked for it but could not find it and
so they suspected me of taking it.' They began to search her and even searched
her private parts.The girl went on, 'By Allah, I was standing with them when
the kite flew over and dropped it and it fell among them. I said, 'This is
what you suspected me and accused me of and I am innocent of it. There it
is.'"
<P>
'A'isha said, "She came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and became a Muslim. She had a tent or small hut in the
mosque. She used to come to me and talk with me. She never sat with me without
saying:

nap here with me.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said to someone, 'See where he is.' He came back and said, 'Messenger
of Allah, he is sleeping in the mosque.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went and found 'Ali lying there. His cloak
had fallen from on top of him and had become covered with dust. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to dust it off,
saying, 'Get up, Abu Turab (Dusty one)! Get up, Abu Turab!'"
<P>
431. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I saw seventy of the people of
the <I>Suffa</I> and not a man among them had a cloak. They either had a

"You will decorate them as the Jews and Christians did."
<P>
435. It is related that 'Abdullah (ibn 'Umar) reported that in the time of
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, the mosque
was built of unfired bricks. Its roof was made of palm fronds and its pillars
were the trunks of palm-trees. Abu Bakr did not add anything to it. 'Umar
added to it, building in the same way that had been employed in the time
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace - using
unburnt bricks and palm-branches - but replacing its pillars with wooden
ones. Then 'Uthman changed it and enlarged it a great deal, building its
walls of engraved stone and plaster and giving it pillars of engraved stone
and a roof of teak.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: Cooperating in the building of the mosque</B>
<P>
<I>"It is not for the idolaters to frequent Allah's mosques, bearing witness
against themselves of their unbelief. They are the ones whose actions come
to nothing. They will be in the Fire timelessly, forever. The mosques of
Allah are only frequented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day
and establish the prayer and pay zakat, and fear no one but Allah. They are
the people most likely to be guided."</I> (9:17-18)
<P>
436. It is related from 'Ikrima, "Ibn 'Abbas said to me and his son 'Ali,
'Go to Abu Sa'id and listen to some of his <I>hadith</I>.' We went and he
was doing some work in a garden. He took his cloak and sat down, wrapping
his legs with it, and then began to tell us <I>hadiths</I> until he reached
the account of the construction of the mosque. He said, 'We were carrying
one brick at a time but 'Ammar carried two. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, saw him and brushed the dust from him, saying, "May
Allah have mercy on 'Ammar! An unjust party will kill him while he is calling
them to the Garden and they are calling him to the Fire." 'Ammar said, "I

said, "If you like, you can give her what remains (Sufyan said once, "If
you like, you can set her free.") but her <I>wala' </I>will remain with us."
When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came,
she mentioned that to him. He said, "Buy her and set her free. The <I>wala'
</I>goes to the one who sets her free." Then the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood on the minbar (Sufyan said once,
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ascended
the minbar") and said, "Why is it that some people make conditions which

the mosque so that you could all see him in the morning, but I remembered

and grant him peace, came out to him and said, 'Release Thumama,' who then
went to some palm-trees near the mosque and washed himself all over. Then

chose what is with Allah.' Abu Bakr wept. I asked myself, 'Why should this
shaykh weep just because Allah gave one of His slaves a choice between this
world and what is with Him and he chose what is with Allah?' However, the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was the slave
referred to and Abu Bakr knew more than we did. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not weep. Abu Bakr has been, of all people,
the most generous to me both with regard to his company and his property.
If I were to have made a close friend of any of my community, it would have
been Abu Bakr, but we have the brotherhood and love of Islam Close up all
the private doorways into the mosque except that of Abu Bakr.'"

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out with a cloth
bandage round his head. He sat on the minbar and praised and lauded Allah.
Then he said, 'There is no one who has been more generous to me with himself
and his property than Abu Bakr ibn Abi Quhafa. If I were to have taken a
close friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend, but the friendship

him and grant him peace,came to Makka and summoned 'Uthman ibn Talha. He

he said, 'Who are you two?' or 'Where are you from?' They said, 'From the
people of at-Ta'if.' He said, 'If you were from the people of this city,

<P>
460. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "A man asked the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, while he was on the minbar, 'What do you say
about the night prayer?' He replied, 'Pairs of <I>rak'ats</I>, and if you
fear the approach of dawn, then pray one on its own and that is the
<I>witr</I> for what you have prayed.'" Ibn 'Umar used to say, "Make the
last of your prayers the <I>witr</I>. That is what the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, commanded."
<P>
461. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that a man came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, while he was giving a <I>khutba</I> and said,
"How is the night prayer prayed?" He said, "Pairs of <I>rak'ats</I>, and
if you fear that dawn will come, then do the <I>witr</I> with one on its
own. That will make what you have prayed into an odd number."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar related to them that a man called out to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was in the mosque.
<P>
462. It is related that Abu Waqid al-Laythi said, "Once while the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in the mosque, three
people came up. Two of them came right up to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the other went away. One of the
two saw a space and sat down in it whereas the other sat down behind everyone
else. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
finished, he said, 'Shall I tell you about the three men? One of them took
himself to Allah and Allah took him in. The other was shy, so Allah was shy
with him. And the other turned away, so Allah turned away from him.'"
<P>

anything but following the <I>deen</I> of Islam. No day would pass without
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visiting
us at either end of it, both morning and evening. Then it occurred to Abu
Bakr to build a mosque in the forecourt of his house. He used to pray and
recite Qur'an in it. The pagan women and children would stand there amazed,
staring at him. Abu Bakr was a man who wept easily and could not control
his tears when reading the Qur'an and this was a matter of great concern
to those nobles of Quraysh who worshipped idols."
<P>
<P>
<B>LIII: Praying in a market mosque</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Awn prayed in a mosque in a house whose door used to be locked while
they were inside.
<P>
465. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The group prayer is twenty-five degrees
higher than the prayer in your house or the prayer in your place of business.
Anyone who does <I>wudu'</I> and goes to the mosque with no other object
than to do the prayer, Allah will raise him up a degree with every step he
takes, and a wrong action will fall away from him, until he enters the mosque.
When he enters the mosque, he is in prayer the whole time he is waiting for
it and the angels pray for him all the time he is sitting there and has not
broken <I>wudu' </I>saying, 'O Allah! Forgive him! O Allah! Show mercy to
him!'"
<P>

when you are left like this among the dregs of the people?" [Meaning that
he interwined his fingers]
<P>
467. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "One believer in relation to another is like a building
whose parts reinforce each other," and he intertwined his fingers.
<P>
468. It is related from Ibn Sirin that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led us in one of the two
night prayers." Ibn Sirin said, "Abu Hurayra named it, but I forgot it".
He said, "He prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> with us and then said the salam. He
got up and went across to a bit of wood lying at an angle in the mosque and
leaned against it as if he were angry. He put his right hand over his left,
intertwining his fingers and placed his right cheek on the back of his left
hand. The people in a hurry went out through the doors of the mosque saying,
"Has the prayer been shortened?" Abu Bakr and 'Umar were among the people
but they were too awed to speak to the Prophet. Also among the people was
a man with long arms called Dhu'l-Yadayn. He said, "Messenger of Allah, have
you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened?" He said, "I did not forget
and it has not been shortened." Then he said, "Is it as Dhu'l-Yadayn says?"
They said, "Yes." So he went forward and prayed what he had omitted and then
did the <I>salam</I>. Then he said the <I>takbir</I> and prostrated as he
normally did or longer. Then he raised his head and said the takbir. Then
he said the <I>takbir</I> and prostrated as he had prostrated before or longer.
Then he raised his head and said the takbir.'"
<P>
They probably asked Ibn Sirin if he then did the salam. He said, "I heard
that 'Imran ibn Husayn said, 'Then he did the <I>salam</I>.'"

the Prophet prayed</B>

him peace, pray in those places."
<P>
It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar used to pray in those places.
<P>
Ibn 'Uqba said, "I asked Salim and I only know that he agreed with Nafi'
on all the places except for a difference regarding the mosque at the hill
of&nbsp;ar-Rawha'.

470. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to stop at Dhu'l-Hulayfa when he
performed<I> 'umra </I>or <I>hajj</I> under an acacia tree at the spot where
the mosque is in Dhu'l-Hulayfa. When he returned from an expedition or was
coming from <I>hajj</I> or<I> 'umra </I>and was on that road, he came down
along the riverbed and emerged from it and would make his camel kneel at
the dip which is on the eastern side of the riverbed. He stayed there until
morning, not at the mosque which is by the rocks nor on the hill with the
mosque on it. There was a water channel there, where 'Abdullah prayed, with
sand heaps in it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, used to pray there. The floodwater drove the pebbles down until the
place where 'Abdullah used to pray was buried.
<P>
'Abdullah related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prayed at the site of the small mosque which is below the mosque at the hill
at ar-Rawha'. 'Abdullah knew the place where the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, had prayed. He said, "It is on your right when you
are standing in prayer in the mosque." That mosque is on the right hand side
of the road when you are going to Makka, a stone's throw or thereabouts from
the largest mosque.
<P>
Ibn 'Umar used to pray towards the small mountain which is at the end of
ar-Rawha'. That mountain ends at the side of the road near the mosque, between
it and al-Munsaraf when you are going to Makka. A mosque was built there.
'Abdullah did not pray in that mosque. He left it to his left and behind
him. He prayed in front of it towards the mountain itself. 'Abdullah came
back from ar-Rawha' and did not pray <I>Dhuhr</I> until he came to that place
where he prayed. If he was coming from Makka and passed by it an hour before
<I>Subh</I> or at the end of the night, he stopped until he could pray
<I>Subh</I> there.
<P>
'Abdullah related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to alight under a large sarj tree below ar-Ruwaytha on the right hand
side of the road, facing the road in a wide level place and go on until he
emerged from the small hill about two miles below the road of ar-Ruwaytha.
The top of it is broken and inclines inward. It stands on a flat place where
there are many sand-dunes.
<P>
'Abdullah related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prayed at the end of the upper part of the valley behind al-'Arj if you are
on the way to Hadba. There are two or three graves at that mosque, on which
are piles of stones, to the right of the path at the large stones marking
the path. 'Abdullah used to return home from al-'Arj after the sun had declined
from midday. He would pray Dhuhr in that mosque.
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Umar related that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, alighted at the sarj trees at the left of the road
in the river bed below Harsha. That slope joined the foot of Harsha about
a bows-shot from the road. 'Abdullah used to pray at the sarj tree which
was nearest the road. It was the tallest of them.
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Umar related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, used to alight at the slope which was closer to Marr az-Zahran
towards Madina where it descends from the small valleys. He would alight
on the flat of that slope to the left of the road when you are going to Makka.
There is only a stone's throw between where the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, alighted and the road.
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Umar related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, used to alight at Dhu Tuwa and spent the night there until morning
when he would pray Subh when he was going to Makka. The place where the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,* prayed was a great mound
which is not inside the mosque which was built there, but is lower down.
<P>
'Abdullah related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
faced the two gaps in the mountain between him and the tall mountain towards
the Ka'ba. He put the mosque that was built to the left of the mosque at
the end of the mound. The place where the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, prayed was lower than it, on the black mound located ten
cubits or thereabouts from the other mound. He prayed there facing the two
gaps in the mountain between him and the Ka'ba.
