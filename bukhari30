Book of Tafsir</BIG></B><P><P>"The All-Merciful, theMost Merciful (<I>ar-Rahm&acirc;n, ar-Rah&icirc;m</I>)"are two names which derive from "mercy (<I>rahma</I>)". <I>Rah&icirc;m</I>and <I>R&acirc;him</I> have the same meaning, as do<I> 'al&icirc;m</I> and<I>'&acirc;lim </I>(knowing).<P><P><B>I: What has come regarding the <I>Fatiha</I> of the Book</B><P>It is called the "Mother of the Book" because it is the first to be writtenin copies of the Qur'an and the first to be recited in the prayer."<I>Deen</I>" means repayment, in both good and evil, from the verb, "torepay, be in debt" (<I>d&acirc;na, yad&icirc;nu</I>).<P>Mujahid said that <I>"bi-d&icirc;n" </I>in 107:1 and 82:9 means "reckoning,and that "<I>mad&icirc;nin</I>" ("exempt from future account" 56:86) means"taken to reckoning".<P>4204. It is related that Sa'id b. al-Mu'alla said, "I was praying in themosque and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,called me, but I did not answer. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I was praying.'He said, 'Does not Allah say, <I>"Respond to Allah, and to the Messenger,when He calls you to what will bring you to life!" </I>(8:24)?' Then he saidto me, 'I will teach you a <I>sura</I> which is the greatest of the<I>suras</I> in the Qur'an before you leave the mosque.' Then he took meby the hand and when he wanted to leave, I said to him, 'Did you not say,"I will teach you a <I>sura</I> which is the greatest of the suras in theQur'an before you&nbsp;leave the mosque'?' He said, '<I>"Praise be to Allah,the Lord of all the worlds." </I>It is the Seven Oft-Repeated ones and theImmense Qur'an which I was given.'"<P><P><B>II: <I>"not of those with anger on them, nor of the misguided"</I></B><P>4205. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "When the Imam says,<I> 'not of thosewith anger on them, nor of the misguided,'</I> then say, 'Ameen.' If someone'sword coincides with that of the angels, he will be forgiven his past wrongactions."<P><P ALIGN=Center><B><BIG><U>Surat al-Baqara</U></BIG></B><P><P><B>III: The words of Allah, <I>"He taught Adam the names of everything."</I>(2:31)</B><P>4206. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "On the Day of Rising people will be gathered and they willsay, 'If only we could ask someone to intercede for us with our Lord!' Theywill go to Adam and say, 'You are the father of mankind. Allah created youwith His hand and His angels prostrated to you and He taught you the namesof everything. Intercede on our behalf with your Lord so that He will relieveus from this place where we are.' He will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,'and he will mention his wrong action and be ashamed. 'Go to Nuh. He is thefirst Messenger that Allah sent to the people of the earth.' They will goto him and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mentionhis asking his Lord for that of which he had no knowledge, and he will beashamed. He will say, 'Go to the Friend of the All-Merciful.' They will goto him and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task. Go to Musa, a slaveto whom Allah spoke directly and to whom He gave the Torah.' They will goto him and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mentionhis killing a life not in retaliation for a life and will be ashamed beforehis Lord. He will say, 'Go to 'Isa, the slave of Allah and His Messenger,the Word of Allah and His Spirit.' But he will say, 'I am not worthy of thistask, Go to Muhammad, a slave whose past and future wrong actions Allah hasforgiven They will come to me and I will go to ask permission from his Lordand He will give me permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down inprostration and He will leave me as long as Allah wills. Then it will besaid, 'Raise your head and ask and you will be given. Speak and it will beheard. Intercede and intercession will be granted.' I will lift my head andpraise Him with praises which He will teach me. He will fix an amount forme and I will let them into the Garden. Then I will return to Him and whenI see my Lord, I will do the same. Then I will intercede and He will fixan amount for me and I will let them into the Garden. Then I will returna fourth time and say, 'Only those remain in the Fire whom the Qur'an hasheld and for whom eternity is obliged.'"<P>Abu 'Abdullah said, "Except those whom the Qur'an has held" refers to thewords of Allah Almighty, <I>"remaining in it timelessly, forever." </I>(16:29)<P><P><B>IV. Chapter</B><P>Mujahid said, <I>"To their shaytans," </I>(2:14) means their companions amongthe hypocrites and idolaters; <I>"encompasses the unbelievers" </I>(2:19)means that Allah gathers them;<I> "colouring (sibgha)" </I>(2:138) is the<I>deen</I>; <I>"except for the humble" </I>(2:45) is the believers in truth.Mujahid said that <I>"bi-quwwa" </I>(2:63) is to act according to what it[i.e. the Torah] contains.<P>Abu'l-'Aliyya said, <I>"sickness" </I>(2:10) is doubt; <I>"those comingafterwards" </I>(2:66) is a designation for those who remain," and "<I>withoutblemish" </I>(2:71) means no whiteness.<P>Another * said that <I>"inflicting an evil punishment on you" </I>(2:49)means they controlled you. <I>Walaya</I> is the verbal noun of <I>wala'</I>,lordship. When it is <I>wilaya</I>, then it is rulership.<P>[* Al-Qasim ibn Sallam and Ma'mar ibn al-Muthanna)<P>One of them said that the grains (61) which they used to eat were all garlic.<P>Qatada said tha<I>t "brought down on themselves" </I>(2:90) is to be changed.<P>Someone else said, <I>"they prayed for victory" </I>(2:89) is to ask forhelp and victory; "<I>sharu</I>" (2:102) is to sell; <I>"ra'ina" </I>(2:104)comes from a word meaning flippancy. When they regard a person as stupid,they say, <I>"ra'ina"</I>. <I>"Not compensate" </I>(2:43, 123) means to beof no use; <I>"footsteps (khutuwat)" </I>(2:168) is from khatw, and meanshis tracks; and "<I>abtala</I>" (2:124) means "to put to the test."<P><P><B>V: The words of the Almighty, <I>"Do not then knowingly make others equalto Allah" </I>(2:22)</B><P>4207. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "I asked the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, 'Which is the greatest sin in the eyes ofAllah?' He replied, 'That you set up a rival with Allah when He created you.'I said, 'That is indeed terrible.' I asked, 'Then what?' He said, 'That youkill your child fearing that he will eat with you.' I said, 'Then what?'He answered, 'That you commit adultery with your neighbour's wife.'"<P><P><B>VI: The words of the Almighty, <I>"And We shaded you with clouds and sentdown manna and quails to you: 'Eat of the good things We have provided foryou.' They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they wronged."(</I>2:57)</B><P>Mujahid said that manna is a gum and quail is a bird.<P>4208. It is related that Sa'id b. Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Truffles are part of manna,and eating them is a cure for the eyes."<P><P><B>VII: <I>"Remember when We said, 'Go into this town. and eat from itwheresoever you like, freely. Enter the gate prostrating and say, "Relieveus of our burdens!" Your mistakes will be forgiven. We will grant increaseto all good-doers.'"</I> (2:58)</B><P><I>"Raghadan" </I>means "ample and abundant."<P>4209. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "The tribe of Israel were told, <I>'Enter thegate prostratiing and say, "Relieve us of our burdens (hitta)!"</I>' butthey changed it and entered crawling on their buttocks, saying, '<I>Hitta</I>is a grain (<I>habba</I>) in a hair.'"<P><P><B>VIII: His words, <I>"Anyone who is the enemy of Jibril."</I> (2:97)</B><P>'Ikrima said, "The meaning of '<I>Jibr</I>', '<I>Mika</I>', and'<I>Saraf</I>' is 'slave' [i.e. in Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil] and <I>'il'</I>means 'Allah'."<P>4210. It is related that Anas said, "When 'Abdullah ibn Salam heard of thearrival of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,in Madina while he was gathering fruit in some land, he went to the Prophetand said, "I will ask you about three things which only a Prophet knows.What is the first sign of the Final Hour? What is the first food that thepeople of the Garden will eat? And for what reason does a child resemblehis father or his mother?" He said, "Jibril has just informed me about them."He said, "Jibril?" He replied, "Yes." He said, "That is the enemy of theJews among the angels." He recited this <I>ayat</I>:<I> "Say, 'Anyone whois an enemy to Jibril should know that it was he who brought it down uponyour heart, by Allah's authority.'" </I>"The first sign of the Final Hourwill be a fire which will gather people from the east to the west. The firstfood that the people of the Garden will eat will be the extra bit of theliver of the fish. When the man's discharge comes first, the child will resemblehim. If the woman has a discharge first, then it will resemble her." He said,"I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that you are theMessenger of Allah. O Messenger of Allah, the Jews are a calumnious people.If they know about my Islam before you ask them about me, they will slanderme in your presence." The Jews came and the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "What kind of man is 'Abdullah ibn Salamamong you?" They said, "The best of us, and the son of the best of us, andour master and the son of our master." The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "What would you think if 'Abdullah wereto become Muslim?" They said, "We seek refuge with Allah from that!" 'Abdullahcame out to them and said, "I testify that there is no god but Allah andI testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messengerof Allah." They said, "The worst of us and the son of the worst of us," andbegan to disparage him. He said, "This is what I feared, Messenger of Allah."<P><P><B>IX: His words, <I>"Whenever We abrogate an ayat or cause it to be forgotten,We bring one better than it or equal to it.</I>" (2:106)</B><P><B> </B>4211. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that 'Umar said, "Our best reciteris Ubayy and the one of us with the most knowledge of judgement is 'Ali.However, we leave some of what Ubayy says because Ubayy says, 'I do not leaveanything that I said from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, while Allah Almighty says, '<I>Whenever We abrogate an ayator cause it to be forgotten</I>.'"<P><P><B>X:<I> "They say, 'Allah has a son.' Glory be to Him!" </I>(2:116)</B><P>4212. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Allah said, 'The son of Adam tells lies aboutMe, and he should not do that. He abuses Me and he should not do that. Asfor his telling lies about Me, he claims that I cannot bring him back ashe was. As for his abusing me, it is his words that I have a son. Glory beto Me about taking a consort or a son!'"<P><P><B>XI: <I>"Take the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer."</I> (2:125)</B><P>The root of <I>mathaba</I> (place of assembly) (2:125) means they returnto a place.<P>4213. It is related that 'Umar said, "Allah agreed with me regarding threethings, or "My Lord agreed with me regarding three things. I said, 'Messengerof Allah, if only you could take the Maqam of Ibrahim as a place of prayer,'and I said, 'Messenger of Allah, both devout and corrupt men visit you. Iwish you would order your wives to veil themselves,' and the <I>ayat</I>of veiling was revealed. It reached me that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, had rebuked some of his wives, and so I visitedthem and said, 'You will stop or Allah will give His Messenger, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, better than you in replacement," until I cameto one of his wives who said, 'O 'Umar! Is not the Messenger of Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, unable to admonish his wives sothat you have to admonish them?' Then Allah sent down, <I>'It may be thatif he does divorce you, his Lord will give him in exchange better wives thanyou: Muslim women...' </I>(66:5)"<P>Another isnad.<P><P><B>XII:<I> "And when Ibrahim built the foundations of the House with Isma'il:'Our Lord, accept this from us! You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.'"</I>(2:127)</B><P><I>Qawa'id </I>is the foundation, and the singular is<I> qa'ida</I>. It isused in 24:60, <I>"As for women who are past child-bearing age," </I>where<I>qawa'id is</I> the singular of <I>qa'id</I>.<P><A HREF="muw7.html#105">4214</A>. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife ofthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, "Do you notknow that when your people rebuilt the Ka'ba, they made it smaller in areathan the original foundations of Ibrahim?" [She said,] "So I said, 'Messengerof Allah, why then do you not rebuild it again on the foundations of Ibrahim?'He said, 'If it had not been that your people were only recently unbelievers,I would have done that.'"<P>'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "If 'A'isha heard this from the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, I believe that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, only omitted touching thetwo corners opposite al-Hijr because it was not completed on the foundationsof Ibrahim."<P><P><B>XIII: <I>"Say, 'We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us.'"</I>(2:136)</B><P>4215. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The People of the Book used torecite the Torah in Hebrew and comment on it in Arabic to the people of Islam.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Donot either confirm nor deny the People of the Book. Say: <I>"We believe inAllah and what has been sent down to us.</I>.." (2:136)'"<P><P><B>XIV: <I>"The fools among the people will ask, 'What has made them turnaround from the direction they used to face?' Say, 'Both East and West belongto Allah. He guides whoever He wills to a straight path.'"</I> (2:142)</B><P>4216. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, prayed towards Jerusalem for sixteen or seventeenmonths although the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, would have liked to face the House. He prayed <I>'Asr </I>with thepeople praying with him. Then one of the men who had prayed with him leftand passed by some people in a mosque who were bowing in <I>ruku'</I>. Hesaid, "I testify by Allah that I prayed with the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, facing Makka." They immediately turnedtowards the House. Some men had died or been slain before the <I>qibla</I>was changed and we did not know what to say about them. Then Allah sentdown,<I> 'Allah would not let your belief go to waste. Allah is All-Gentle,Most Merciful to mankind.</I>' (2:143)"<P><P><B>XV: <I>"Hence We have made you a middlemost community, so that you mayact as witnesses against mankind and the Messenger as a witness againstyou.</I>" (2:143)</B><P>4217. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Nuh will be summoned on theDay of Rising and he will say, 'At your service and obedience, O Lord!' Hewill say, 'Didd you convey it?' He will say, 'Yes.' It will be said to hiscommunity, 'Did he convey it to you?' They will say, 'No warner came to us.'He will say, 'Who will then testify on your behalf?' He will say, 'Muhammadand his community.' They will testify that he conveyed it. 'The Messengera witness over yourselves. Those are His words, may His mention be exalted!.<I>'Hence We have made you a middlemost community, so that you may act aswitnesses against mankind and the Messenger as a witness against you.'</I>(2:143) The "middlemost" is equitable."<P><P><B>XVI: <I>"We only appointed the direction you used to face in order toknow him who follows the Messenger from him who turns round on his heels.Though in truth it is a very hard thing &#150; except for those Allah hasguided. Allah would not let your belief go to waste. Allah is All-Gentle,Most Merciful to mankind." </I>(2:143)</B><P>4218. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "While the people were performingthe <I>Subh</I> prayer at <I>Quba'</I>, someone came to them and said, 'SomeQur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, saying that he should face the Ka'ba, so face it.' They then facedtowards the Ka'ba."<P><P><B>XVII:<I> "We have seen you looking up into heaven, turning this way andthat, so We will turn you towards a direction which will please you. Turnyour face, therefore, towards the Sacred Mosque.</I>...to ... <I>what theydo."</I> (2:144)</B><P>4219. It is related that Anas said, "None of those who prayed to the two<I>qiblas</I> still remain except me."<P><P><B>XVIII: <I>"If you were to bring every Sign to those given the Book, theystill would not follow your direction. </I>to .. <I>you would then be oneof the wrongdoers." </I>(2:145)</B><P>4220. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "While the people were performingthe <I>Subh</I> prayer at Quba', a man came to them and said, 'In the nightsome Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and he was commanded to face the Ka'ba, so face it.' Theyhad been facing Syria and so they turned around towards the Ka'ba."<P><P><B>XIX: <I>"Those We have given the Book recognise it as they recognise theirown sons. Yet a group of them knowingly conceal the truth. The truth is fromyour Lord, so on no account be among the doubters." </I>(2:146-147)</B><P>4221. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "While the people were performingthe <I>Subh</I> prayer at Quba', someone came to them and said, 'In the nightsome Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and he was commanded to face the Ka'ba, so face it.' Theyhad been facing Syria and so they turned around towards the Ka'ba."<P><P><B>XX: <I>"Each person faces a particular direction so race each other tothe good. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together. Truly Allahhas power over everything." </I>(2:148)</B><P>4222. It is related that al-Bara' was heard to say, "We prayed with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, towards Jerusalem for sixteen orseventeen months and then he turned it towards the qibla."<P><P><B>XXI: <I>"From wherever you come out turn your face to the Sacred Mosque.This is certainly the truth from your Lord. Allah is not heedless of whatyou do."</I> (2:149)</B><P>"<I>Shatruhu</I>" means towards it.<P>4223. It is related that Ibn 'Umar was heard to say, "While the people wereperforming the <I>Subh</I> prayer at Quba', a man came to them and said,'In the night some Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and he was commanded to face the Ka'ba, soface it.' They turned around where they were and faced the Ka'ba. The peoplehad been facing had been facing Syria."<P><P><B>XXII: <I>"Wherever you come from, turn your face to the Sacred Mosque.Wherever you are, turn your faces towards it </I>. .to . .<I>so that perhapsyou will be guided." </I>(2:150)</B><P>4224. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "While the people were performingthe <I>Subh</I> prayer at Quba', someone came to them and said, 'In the nightsome Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and he was commanded to face the Ka'ba, so face it.' Theyhad been facing Syria and so they turned around towards the qibla: the Ka'ba."<P><P><B>XXIII: His words, <I>"Safa and Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks ofAllah, so anyone who goes on hajj to the House or does 'umra incurs no wrongin going back and forth between them. If anyone spontaneously does good,Allah is All-Thankful, All-Knowing." </I>(2:158)</B><P><I>Sha'a'ir </I>are waymarks, the singular being <I>sha'ira.</I> Ibn 'Abbassaid that "<I>safwan</I>" means stone. It is also said to be the smooth stoneon which nothing grows, the singular being <I>safwana</I>, meaning Safa.<I>Safa</I> is used for the plural.<P>4225. It is related that 'Urwa said, "When I was young I asked 'A'isha, thewife of the Prophet, 'What do you think of the words of Allah the Blessedand Almighty, "<I>Safa and Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks of Allah,so anyone who goes on hajj to the House or does 'umra incurs no wrong ingoing back and forth between them</I>." By Allah, so I think there is noharm in someone not going between Safa and Marwa' 'A'isha said, 'No, if itwas as you say, it would have been, "...there is no harm in him not doing<I>tawaf</I> of them." However, this <I>ayat</I> was sent down about theAnsar who used previously to go into <I>ihram</I> for the idol Manat whichwas opposite Qudayd. They considered it to be a sin to do <I>tawaf</I> ofSafa and Marwa. When Islam came, they asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, about that and Allah Almighty sent down, "Behold!Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So if those who visit theHouse in the Season or at other times, should compass them round, it is nosin in them." '"<P>4226. It is related that 'Asim ibn Sulayman said, :I asked Anas ibn Malikabout Safa and Marwa and he said, "We used to think that they were part ofthe business of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>. When Islam came, we kept back fromthem, and then Allah Almighty sent down: '<I>Safa and Marwa are among theSacred Landmarks of Allah, so anyone who goes on hajj to the House or does'umra incurs no wrong in going back and forth between them</I>.'"<P><P><B>XXIV: His words, <I>"Some people set up equals to Allah, loving them asthey should love Allah."</I> (2:165)</B><P><I>Andad</I> means adversaries, the singular being <I>nidd</I>.<P>4227. It is related from 'Abdullah, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said one thing and I said another. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever dies calling on a rival toAllah will enter the Fire.' I said, 'Whoever does not call on a rival toAllah will enter the Garden.'"<P><P><B>XXV:<I> "You who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the caseof people killed: free man for free man, slave for slave, female for female.But if someone is absolved by his brother, blood-money should be claimedwith correctness and paid with good will. That is an easement and a mercyfrom your Lord. Anyone who goes beyond the limits after this will receivea painful punishment." </I>(2:178)</B><P>"'<I>Ufiya</I>" means left.<P>4228. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas was heard to say, "Retaliation existedamong the tribe of Israel, but they did not have blood-money. Allah Almightysaid to this community: <I>'Retaliation is prescribed for you in the caseof people killed: free man for free man, slave for slave, female for female.But if someone is absolved by his brother,'</I> and that remission is thathe accept the blood money for murder, <I>'blood-money should be claimed withcorrectness and paid with good will.' </I>he should demand it correctly andpay it with good will. <I>'That is an easement and a mercy from your Lord,'</I>in relation to what was prescribed to those before you, <I>'Anyone who goesbeyond the limits after this will receive a painful punishment."</I> (2:178)This is killing after accepting blood money."<P>4229. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "Retaliation is prescribed in the Book of Allah."<P>4230. It is related from Anas that his aunt, ar-Rubayya', broke the toothof a slavegirl and they asked her to grant remission and they refused. Sothey offered compensation and they refused. They went to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and refused anything exceptretaliation. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,commanded retaliation. Anas ibn an-Nadr said, "O Messenger of Allah, willthe tooth of ar-Rubayya' be broken? No, by the One who sent you with thetruth, her tooth will not be broken!" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "O Anas, the Book of Allah prescribesretaliation." Then the people were pleased and granted remission. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are slavesof Allah who, if they were to make an oath, Allah would fulfil it."<P><P><B>XXVI: <I>"You who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribedfor those before you &#150; so that perhaps you will be godfearing .</I>"(2:183)</B><P>4231. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The people of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>used to fast the Day of 'Ashura'. Then when Ramadan was revealed, he said,'Anyone who wishes to fast it may do so and anyone who wishes to can notfast it.'"<P>4232. It is related from 'A'isha, "'Ashura' used to be fasted before Ramadan.When Ramadan was revealed, he said, 'Anyone who wishes to fast it may doso and anyone who wishes to not fast can do so."<P>4233. It is related that 'Abdullah said that al-Ash'ath visited him whilehe was eating and said, "Today is 'Ashura'?" He said, "It used to be fastedbefore Ramadan was revealed. When Ramadan was revealed, it was abandoned,so eat then."<P>4234. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Quraysh used to fast the Dayof 'Ashura' in the <I>Jahiliyya</I> and the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, used to fast it. When he came to Madina, he fasted itand commanded that it be fasted. When Ramadan was revealed, Ramadan was madeobligatory and 'Ashura' was left.

"Nephew, Islam was built on five: belief in Allahand His Messenger, the five prayers, the fast of Ramadan, paying the<I>zakat</I> and hajj to the House." He said, "Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman!

Then Islamhad many followers and so there was no <I>fitna</I>." He said, "So what doyou say about 'Ali and 'Uthman?" He said, "Allah has pardoned 'Uthman whileyou* dislike that he should be pardoned. 'Ali was the cousin and son-in-lawof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."

It is related from Marwan al-Asfar that it is related from one of theCompanions of the Messenger of Allah, and he said, "I reckon it was Ibn 'Umar,"said that "<I>Whether you divulge what is in yourselves or keep it hidden</I>"(2:284) was abrogated by the <I>ayat</I> after it.<P><P><FONT COLOR="#5e0c04"><B><BIG>LVIII: Tafsir of <I>Surat Ali'Imran</I></BIG></B></FONT><P><I>Tuqa</I> (3:27) and <I>taqiyya</I> (guarding oneself) are the same."<I>Sirr</I>" (3:117) is cold.

It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "There is no child born but that Shaytan toucheshim when he is born and he lets out a cry because shaytan has touched him- except for Maryam and her son."

It islike the active participle.<P>4275. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears to an oathwhich he is asked to take in order to deprive a Muslim of his property willwill meet Allah and He will be angry with him." Allah sent down the confirmationof that: <I>'Those who sell Allah's contract and their own oaths for a paltryprice, such people will have no portion in the Next World ...' </I>(to theend of the <I>ayat</I>)" (3:77) He said, "Al-Ash'ath came and said, 'Whathas Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman [i.e. 'Abdullah] related to you?'

It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa that a man set up some goodsin the market and swore by Allah that he had been offered for them an amountthat he had not in fact been offered in order to entice a Muslim man intobuying them. So it was revealed, "<I>those who sell Allah's contract andtheir own oaths for a paltry price</I> (3:77)<P>4277. It is related from Ibn Abi Mulayka that two women where stitching shoesin a house or room. Then one of them emerged with an awl in her palm andshe made a claim against the other woman. Their case was presented to Ibn'Abbas and Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'If people were to given on the basis of theirclaim, the life and property of the community would vanish.' Remind her byAllah and recite to her, <I>'Those who sell &nbsp;Allah's contract ...'</I>(3:77)" They admonished her and she admitted it. Ibn 'Abbas said, "TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The oath is takenby the one against whom the claim is made.'"<P><P><B>LXII: <I>"Say, 'O People of the Book!

It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said that Abu Sufyan ibn Harbinformed him directly. "I set out during the period when the the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had a truce with me. WhileI was in Syria, a letter was taken from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, to Heraclius. Dihya al-Kalbi brought it and gave itto the governor of Bosra and the governor of Bosra gave it to Heraclius."Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone here from the people of this man who claimsto be a Prophet?' They replied, 'Yes.' I was summoned with a group of Qurayshand we went in to Heraclius and we were made to sit in front of him. He asked,'Who among you is closest in lineage to this man who claims that he is aProphet?' I said, 'I am.' So they made me sit in front of him while theysat my companions behind me. Then he summoned his translator and said, 'Tellthem that I am going to ask this person about this man. If he tells me alie, then call him a liar.'"<P>Abu Sufyan said, "By Allah, if I had not been afraid that they would transmita lie from me [later on], I would have lied about him. Then he said to histranslator, 'Ask him: What is his lineage among you?' I replied. 'He belongsamongst us to a noble lineage.' He asked, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?'I answered, 'No.' He asked, 'Did you suspect him of being a liar before hesaid what he said?" I replied, 'No.' He asked, 'Do the nobles or the humblepeople follow him?' I replied, 'The humble people.' He asked, 'Are they onthe increase or decrease?' I said, 'They are on the increase.' He asked,'Does any of them become displeased with his <I>deen</I> and apostatize afterentering it?' I said, 'No.' He asked, 'Have you fought him?' I answered,'Yes.' He went on, 'How did your fight against him go?' I said, 'Successin the war alternated between us - sometimes he would get the better of usand sometimes we of him.' He asked, 'Does he act treacherously?' I said,'No. We are in a time of truce with him but we do not know what he will doduring it.'" Abu Sufyan said, "I could not find anything to add to what Isaid except this sentence.'<P>"Then he asked, 'Has anyone of your people ever said what he says beforehim?' I said, 'No.' Then he said to his translator, 'Say to him: "I askedyou about his lineage among you and you said that he has noble lineage; inthe same way all the Messengers who were sent came from noble lineage amongtheir peoples. I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king and yousaid no. If one of his ancestors had been a king, I would have said thathe was a man seeking the kingdom of his ancestors. I asked you whether thenobles or humble people followed him and you said that the humble peoplefollowed him. They are always the ones who follow the Messengers. I askedyou whether you accused him of being a liar before he said what he said andyou said that you did not. I knew that someone who would refuse to lie aboutpeople would not then go and tell lies against Allah. I asked you whetheranyone had apostatized out of dislike for his <I>deen</I> after he had enteredand you said that they had not. That is how it is with belief when its joymixes with the hearts. I asked you whether they were on the increase or decreaseand you said that they were on the increase. That is what happens with beliefuntil it is complete. I asked you whether you had fought him and you saidthat you had fought him and that success in the war alternated between you- sometimes he would get the better of you and sometimes you of him. Thusare the Messengers tested and then they have the final outcome. I asked youwhether he had been treacherous and you said no. That is how it is with theMessengers - they are not treacherous. I asked you whether anyone else amongyour people had said such a thing and you said they had not. If anyone hadsaid this before him, I would have said that he was a man following the precedentof something said before.'"<P>He said, "Then he said, 'What does he order you to do?'" He said, "I replied,'He commands us to pray, to pay zakat, maintain ties of kinship and to bechaste.' He said, 'If what you said about him is true, then he is a Prophet.I knew that he was going to appear, but I did not think that it would befrom you. If I knew that I could reach him, I would like to to meet him.If I were with him, I would wash his feet, and his kingdom will extend towhat is under my feet.'"<P>He said, ""Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah and readit out, saying, 'In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful,from Muhammad, the slave of Allah and His Messenger, to Heraclius, rulerof the Byzantines. Peace be upon the one who follows guidance. I call youto Islam. If you become Muslim, you will be safe and Allah will double yourreward. If you turn away, then you incur the wrong action of your subjects.<I>"O People of the Book! Come to a proposition which is the same for usand you &#150; that we should worship none but Allah and not attribute anypartners to Him and not take one another as lords besides Allah. If theyturn away, say, "Bear witness that we are Muslims."</I> (3:64)' When he finishedreading the letter, voices were raised in his presence and there was a greatuproar. We were commanded to be turned out." He said, "When we were turnedout, I said to my companions, 'This business of Ibn Abi Kabsha* has becomeso prominent that he alarms even the King of the Greeks.' Then I became certainthat he would be victorious until Allah brought me to Islam."<P>Az-Zuhri said, "Heraclius summoned the great men of Byzantium and they metin a house of his. He said, 'People of Byzantium! Do you desire success andright guidance forever and for your kingdom to remain firm?' The people ranto the gates like wild asses and found them closed. He said, 'Bring themback to me.' He called them and then said, "I was testing your strength inyour <I>deen</I> (religion), and I have seen what I like in you." So theyprostrated to him and were pleased with him."<P>[*Meaning the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.This expression was used in an insulting manner to the Prophet.]<P><P><B>LXIII<I>: "You will not attain true goodness until you give of what youlove. Whatever you give away, Allah knows it."</I> (3:92)</B><P><B> </B>4279. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "Abu Talha had moreproperty in palm trees than any of the Ansar in Madina. His favourite propertywas Bayruha' which was opposite the mosque. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, used to enter it and drink its sweet water.When this <I>ayat</I> was sent down:<I> 'You will not attain true goodnessuntil you give of what you love.' </I>(3:92) Abu Talha got up and said,'Messenger of Allah, Allah says, <I>'You will not attain true goodness untilyou give of what you love.' </I>The property I love the best is Bayruha'.It is <I>sadaqa</I> for Allah whose goodness I hope for and I hope that itwill be stored up for me with Allah. Messenger of Allah, dispose of it inwhatever way Allah shows you is best.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Excellent! That is a profitable property.That is is a profitable property. I have heard what you have said and I thinkthat you should give it to your relatives.' So Abu Talha divided it amonghis relatives and cousins."<P>'Abdullah ibn Yusuf and Rawh ibn 'Ubada said, "That isa profitable(<I>rabih</I> rather than <I>ra'ih</I>) property."<P>Yahya ibn Yahya related, "I recited to Malik, "a <I>ra'ih </I>property."<P>It is related that Anas said, "He gave it to Haddan and Ubayy, and althoughI was a closer relative, he did not allot me any of it."<P><P><B>LXIV: <I>"Say, 'Bring the Torah and read it out if you are telling thetruth.'" </I>(3:93)</B><P>4280. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Jews brought the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a man and woman among them who hadfornicated. He asked them, "What do you do with the one among you who commitsfornication?" They said, "We blacken their faces with coal and beat them."He asked, "Do you not find stoning in the Torah?" They said, "We do not findanything it in it." 'Abdullah ibn Salam told them, "You lied. Bring the Torahand recite it if you are speaking the truth." Their teacher who was instructingthem put his hand over the verse of stoning and began to read what was underand above his hand and he did not read the verse of stoning. He pulled hishand from the verse of stoning and said, "So what is this?" When they sawthat, they said, "It is the verse of stoning." So he commanded that theybe stoned close to the place of funerals at the mosque. I saw her companionleaning over her to protect her from the stones."<P><P><B>LXV: <I>"You are the best nation ever to be produced before mankind.</I>"(3:110)</B><P>4281. It is related from Abu Hurayra regarding, <I>"You are the best nationever to be produced before mankind," </I>(3:110) "The people who are bestfor other people are those who drag them with chains round their necks untilthey enter Islam."<P><P><B>LXVI: <I>"And when two of your clans were on the point of losing heart."</I> (3:122)</B><P>4282. It is related that 'Abdullah used to say, "This was revealed aboutus: <I>'And when two of your clans were on the point of losing heart, andAllah was their Protector.'</I> (3:110)" He said, "We were two parites, theBanu Haritha and the Banu Salima, and we wanted (and Sufyan said once, 'itwould not delight us') if it had not been revealed since Allah says, 'butAllah was their protector.'"<P><P><B>LXVII: <I>"You have no part in the affair." </I>(3:128)</B><P>4283. It is related from Salim's father that he heard the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say when he lifted his head from<I>ruku' </I>in the last <I>rak'at </I>of <I>Fajr</I>, "O Allah, curse so-and-soand so-and-so and so-and-so," after he said, "Allah hears whoever praisesHim, Our Lord, praise is Yours." Then Allah revealed, <I>"You have no partin the affair. Either He will turn to them or He will punish them, for theyare the wrongdoers." </I>(3:128)<P>4284. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to invoke against anyone orfor anyone, he would stand in <I>qanut</I> after <I>ruku'</I>. He might saywhen he had said, 'Allah hears whoever praises Him,' 'O Allah, Our Lord,praise is Yours. O Allah, rescue al-Walid ibn al-Walid, Salama ibn Hishamand 'Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'a. O Allah, be hard on Mudar! O Allah, give themyears of drought like the drought years of Yusuf!' He said that aloud. Heused to say in part of his prayer in the Fajr prayer, 'O Allah! Curse so-and-soand so-and-so,' naming tribes of the Arabs until Allah revealed, '<I>Youhave no part in the affair.</I>' (3:128)"<P><P><B>LXVIII:<I> "The Messenger was calling to you from the rear."</I>(3:153)</B><P>"<I>Ukhra</I>" is the feminine of "<I>akhir</I>".<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, <I>"one of the two best things" </I>(9:52) is conquest ormartyrdom.<P>4285. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, put 'Abdullah ibn Jubayr in charge of theinfantry in the Battle of Uhud and they returned defeated. That was whenthe Messenger was calling them from their rear, and only twelve men remainedwith the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."<P><P><B>LXIX: <I>"restful sleep" </I>(3:154)</B><P>4286. It is related that Anas said that Abu Talha said, "We were overcomewith slumber when we were in the lines in the Battle of Uhud." He said, "Mysword would fall from my hand and I would pick it up, and it would fall frommy hand again an I would pick it up."<P><P><B>LXX:<I> "Those who who did good and were godfearing among those who respondedto Allah and the Messenger after the wound had been inflicted will have animmense reward." </I>(3:172)</B><P>"<I>Qarh</I>" is a wound.

It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "<I>'Allah is enough for us andthe best of guardians.'</I> Ibrahim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said this when he was thrown into the Fire and Muhammad, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said it when they said, <I>'The people have gatheredagainst you so fear them.' But that merely increased them in belief and theysaid, "Allah is enough for us and the best of guardians."'" (3:173)</I><P>4288. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The last words of Ibrahim whenhe was thrown into the Fire were, "<I>Allah is enough for us and the bestof guardians</I>.'"<P><P><B>LXXII:<I> "Those who are tight-fisted with the bounty Allah has giventhem should not suppose that that is better for them. No indeed, it is worsefor them! What they were stingy with will be hung around their necks on theDay of Rising. Allah is the inheritor of the heavens and the earth and Allahis aware of everything you do."</I> (3:180)</B><P><I>"Hung around their necks"</I> is as you clasp on a collar.<P>4289. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone is given wealth byAllah and does not pay the <I>zakat</I> due on it, then on the Day of Risingit will appear to him in the form of a smooth-headed male viper with twoblack spots over its eyes. It will coil around his neck and strike at hischeeks saying, 'I am your wealth. I am your treasure."' Then he recited,<I>'Those who are tight-fisted with the bounty Allah has given them shouldnot suppose that that is better for them..</I>..'" (3:180)<P><P><B>LXXXIII: <I>"You will hear many abusive words from those given the Bookbefore you and from those who worship idols." </I>(3:186)</B><P>4290. It is related from Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that Usama ibn Zayd reportedthat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rodea donkey with a cloth made in Fadak and Usama ibn Zayd was riding behindhim. He went to visit Sa'd ibn 'Ubada in the Banu'l-Harith ibn al-Khazrajbefore the Battle of Badr. He said, "Then he passed by a gathering whichcontained 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, and that was before 'Abdullah ibnUbayy became Muslim. The gathering contained a mixture of Muslims, idolaters,pagans, and Jews. 'Abdullah ibn Rawaha was in the gathering. When the dustof the donkey reached the gathering, 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy covered his nosewith his cloak and then said, "Don't cover us with dust!" The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, greeted them and then stopped,He dismounted and invited them to Allah and recited the Qur'an to them. 'Abdullahibn Ubayy ibn Salul said, "O man! There is nothing better than what you sayif it is the truth. So do not annoy us with it in our gatherings. Returnto your mount and recount to whoever comes to you." 'Abdullah ibn Rawahasaid, "Indeed, Messenger of Allah! Bring it to us in our gatherings. We likethat!" So the Muslims, idolaters and Jews abused one another until they werepractically fighting. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,kept on calming them down until they were quiet. Then the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, mounted his animals and went until he visitedSa'd ibn 'Ubada. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidto him, "Sa'd, did you not hear what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy)said? He said such-and-such." Sa'd ibn 'Ubada said, "O Messenger of Allah,pardon him and overlook it. By the One who sent down the Book on you, Allahhas brought the truth which He sent down on you when the people of this littletown had agreed to crown him and bind his head with a (royal) turban. WhenAllah refused that by the truth which Allah gave you, he was vexed on thataccount. That is why he did what you saw." So the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, pardoned him. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and his Companions used to pardon the idolatersand the People of the Book as Allah commanded them and they endured harm.Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, said, <I>"You will hear many abusive wordsfrom those given the Book before you and from those who worship idols,"</I>(3:186) and Allah said<I>, "Many of the People of the Book would loveit if they could make you revert to being rejectors after you have believed,showing their innate envy..." </I>(2:109) The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, used to hold to pardon as long as Allah commanded thatuntil Allah gave permission regarding them. When the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on the Badr expedition, Allahkilled the nobles of Quraysh through him and Ibn Ubayy ibn Salul and thoseof the idolaters and pagans with him, said, "This is a business which hasbeen victorious," and they gave allegiance to the Messenger* in Islam, andbecame Muslim.<P><P><B>LXXIV: <I>"Do not suppose that those who exult in what they have done..."</I>(3:188)</B><P>4291. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that in the time of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, some men of the hypocritesused to stay behind when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, went out on an expedition. They were happy with their stayingbehing the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Whenthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came, theymade their excuses to him and took oaths and wanted to be praised for whatthey had not done. So it was revealed, <I>"Do not suppose that those whoexult in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have notdone."</I> (3:188)<P>4292. It is reported from 'Alqama ibn Waqqas that Marwan said to his doorman."Rafi', go to Ibn 'Abbas and say, 'If every man who rejoices in what he bringsand wants to be praised for what he has not done will be punished, then wewill all be punished.'" Ibn 'Abbas said, "What does this have to do withyou? The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, summoned the Jewsand asked them about something and they exulted in the concealment they did."Then Ibn 'Abbas recited,<I> "When Allah made a covenant with those giventhe Book ... those who exult in what they have done and love to be praisedfor what they have not done</I>." (3:187-188)<P>'Abdu'r-Razzaq corroborated it from Ibn Jurayj.<P>Another <I>isnad</I> to that effect from Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awfabout Marwan.<P><P><B>LXXV: <I>"In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternationof night and day, there are Signs for people of intelligence."</I>(3:190)</B><P>4293. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I spent the night with my auntMaymuna. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,spoke to his wife awhile and they lay down. When it was the last third ofthe night, he sat up and looked at the sky and said, <I>'In the creationof the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, thereare Signs for people of intelligence.'</I> (3:190) Then he got up, did<I>wudu'</I>, cleaned his teeth and prayed eleven <I>rak'ats</I>. Then Bilalgave the <I>adhan</I> and he prayed two <I>rak'ats</I>. Then he went outand prayed <I>Subh</I>."<P><P><B>LXXVI: <I>"Those who remember Allah standing, sitting and lying on theirsides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth."</I>(3:191)</B><P>4294.

Theysaid, "No." He said, "Do you dispute with one another about seeing the moonon the night of the full moon when it is light and there are no clouds?"They answered, "No." He said, "You will not disagree about seeing Allah,the Mighty and Exalted, on the Day of Rising except as you disagree aboutseeing either of them. On the Day of Rising, an announcer will make aproclamation: 'Let every community follow what they used to worship.' Noneof those who worshipped other than Allah in the form of idols and figureswill remain who does not fall into the Fire until there only remains thosewho worshipped Allah, pious or impious, and the remnants of the People ofthe Book. The Jews will be summoned and they will be asked, "What were youworshipping?" They will say, "We used to worship 'Uzayr the son of God."They will be told, "You lied. Allah has not taken consort or son. What areyou seeking?" They will say, "We are thirsty, our Lord, so let us drink."An indication will be made, "Will you not be taken to drink?" and they willbe gathered to the Fire which will be like a mirage whose parts are consumingone another. They will fall into the Fire. Then the Christians will be summonedand it will be said to them, "What were you worshipping?" They will say,"We used to worship the Messiah son of God." They will be told, "You lied.Allah has not taken consort or son.
