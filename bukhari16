<P>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Allah has permitted trade and He has forbidden
usury." </I>(2:275) and His words, <I>"Unless it is an immediate transaction
hand to hand taken and given without delay." </I>(2:282)
<P>
I: What has come about the words of Allah Almighty:
<P>
<I>"Then when the prayer is finished spread through the earth and seek Allah's
bounty and remember Allah much so that perhaps you may be successful. But
when they see a chance of trade or entertainment they scatter off to it and
leave you standing there. Say: 'What is with Allah is better than trade or
entertainment. Allah is the best of providers.'" </I>(62:10-11)
<P>
and His words, <I>"O you who believe! Do not consume one another's property
by false means, but only by means of mutually agreed trade."</I> (4:29)
<P>
1942. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "You say that Abu Hurayra relates
many <I>hadiths</I> from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and you say, 'Why do the Muhajirun and Ansar not relate
from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as
Abu Hurayra does?' My brothers among the Muhajirun used to be busy with business
in the markets while I used to stick close to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, having what would fill my stomach. I
was present when they were absent and I remembered when they forgot. My brothers
among the Ansar were busy with their property while I was one of the poor
people of the Suffa. I would remember when they forgot. In a <I>hadith</I>
which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, related,
he said, 'If one of you spreads out his garment until I finish what I am
saying here, and then gathers his garment to him, he will remember what I
say.' I spread out a striped garment which I was wearing until the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished what he was saying.
I gathered it to my breast. So I did not forget anything that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said."
<P>
1943. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf said, "When we arrived in
Madina, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
established brotherhood between me and Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'. Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'
said, 'I am the wealthiest man of the Ansar so I will allot you half of my
property. See which of my two wives you like and I will divorce her for you.
When she has become lawful, then you can marry her.'" 'Abdu'r-Rahman said,
"That is not what I need. Is there any market where trading goes on?" He
replied, "The Qaynuqa' market."
<P>
Ibrahim ibn Sa'd said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman went there and bought some dried yoghurt
and ghee." He said, "Then he continued to go. It was not long before
'Abdu'r-Rahman arrived with traces of yellow scent on him. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'Have you got married?'
He replied, 'Yes.' He asked, 'To whom?' He answered, 'A woman of the Ansar.'
He asked, 'How much did you give her?' He said, 'Gold the weight of a date-stone
(or a date-stone of gold).' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, told him, 'Hold a wedding-feast, even if only with a sheep.'"
<P>
[Qaynuqa' were one of the Jewish tribes in Madina.]
<P>
1944. It is related that Anas said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf arrived in Madina
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, established brotherhood
between me and Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi' al-Ansari. Sa'd was wealthy and said to
'Abdu'r-Rahman, 'I will split my property in half with you and help you to
marry.' He said, 'May Allah bless you in your family and property but just
direct me the market.' He did not return until he had made a profit selling
dried yoghurt and ghee. He brought it to the people of his household. After
a short time had passed - or as long as Allah willed - he arrived with a
smear of yellow scent on him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, asked him, 'What is this?' He replied, 'Messenger of Allah, I
have married a woman of the Ansar.' He asked, 'What did you give her?' He
answered, 'A date-stone of gold (or the weight of a date-stone of gold).'
He said, 'Hold a wedding-feast, even if only with a sheep.'"
<P>
1945. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "'Ukaz, Majanna and Dhu'l-Majaz
were the markets of the people in the time of <I>Jahiliyya</I>. When Islam
came, it seemed that people regarded attending them as a sin until it was
revealed, <I>'There is nothing wrong with your seeking bounty from your Lord
(during the hajj festival).'</I>" .(2:198) Ibn 'Abbas recited it [with those
words 'during the hajj festival'.]

<P>
Another <I>isnad</I> from ash-Sha'bi from an-Nu'man ibn Bashir.
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi heard an-Nu'man ibn Bashir say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The <I>halal</I> is clear and the
<I>haram</I> is clear. But between the two there are doubtful things. Someone
who abandons an action, being unsure whether it is a wrong action or not,
is more likely to abandon one which clearly is. Someone who risks doing an
action, being unsure whether it is a wrong action or not, is more than likely
to fall into one that clearly is. Acts of disobedience [to Allah] are the
private preserve (<I>hima</I>) of Allah. Anyone who pastures animals around
a private preserve is on the verge of entering it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Explanation of doubtful things</B>
<P>
Hassan ibn Abi Sinan said, "I have not found anything easier than scrupulousness:
'Leave what gives you doubt for what gives you no doubt.'"
<P>
1947. 'Abdullah ibn Abi Mulayka narrated from 'Uqba ibn al-Harith that a
black woman came and claimed that she had nursed both of them [i.e. 'Uqba
and his wife]. He mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, turned
away from him, smiled, and asked, "How can you keep her when that has been
said?" His wife was the daughter of Abu Ihab at-Tamimi.
<P>
1948. It is related that 'A'isha said, "'Utba ibn Abi Waqqas took an undertaking
from his brother, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, 'The son of the slavegirl of Zam'a
is my son. Please take possession of him.'" She said, "In the year of the
Conquest, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas took him and said, 'He is my nephew, I gave
an undertaking about him.' 'Abd ibn Zam'a stood up and said, 'He is my brother,
the son of my father's slavegirl. He was born on his bed.' They both went
to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Sa'd said,
'Messenger of Allah, he is my nephew. I gave an undertaking about him.' 'Abd
ibn Zam'a said, 'He is my brother and the son of my father's slave. He was
born on his bed.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'He is yours, 'Abd ibn Zam'a.' Then the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, &nbsp;said, ' The child belongs to the bed and stones
are for the adulterer.' Then he said to Sawda bint Zam'a, the wife of the
Prophet, 'Veil yourself from him,' because of the resemblance he saw in him
to 'Utba. He did not see her until he met Allah [i.e. died]."
<P>
1949. It is related that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I asked the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about featherless arrows. He said,
'If it hits with its sharp end, then eat. If it hits side on, do not eat.
It has been beaten to death.' I said, 'Messenger of Allah, what happens if
I let loose my dog and say the <I>basmala</I> and then find another dog with
it standing over the game, over which I have not mentioned the
<I>basmala</I>, and do not know which of them took it?' He said, 'Do not
eat it for you have said the <I>basmala</I> over your dog but not over the
other one.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Doubtful things which should&nbsp;be avoided</B>
<P>
1950. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, passed by a fallen date and said, 'If it was not for the
fact that it might have been <I>sadaqa</I>, I would have eaten it.'"
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet*, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace,said, "I found a date which had fallen onto my bed."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Someone not thinking that whisperings and the like are an aspect of
doubtful things</B>
<P>
1951. It is related that the uncle of 'Abbas ibn Tamim said, "A man asked
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whether someone should
break off the prayer if he felt something in in it. He said, 'No, not unless
he hears a noise or smells something.'"
<P>
Ibn Abi Hafsa said from az-Zuhri, "There is no need to do w<I>udu' </I>unless
you smell something or hear a noise."
<P>
1952. It is related from 'A'isha that some people asked, "Messenger of Allah,
what happens if meat is brought to us by some people and we do not know whether
they have mentioned the name of Allah over it or not?" The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Say the name of Allah over
it and eat it.'"

Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a caravan carrying food
came from Syria and people went off towards it until there were only twelve
men left with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and this
ayat was sent down: <I>'But when they see a chance of trade or entertainment
they scatter off to it and leave you standing.' </I>(62:11)"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Someone not being concerned about where he earns money</B>
<P>
1954. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "A time will come for people when a man will not
care from what source he gets his livelihood nor whether it is <I>halal</I>
or <I>haram</I>."

trade or commerce from the remembrance of Allah." </I>(24:37)
<P>
Qatada said, "People used to sell to each other and trade, but when the time
came for fulfilling one of the rights of Allah, neither trade nor selling
would distract them from the remembrance of Allah until they had discharged
their duty to Allah."
<P>
1955. It is related that Abu'l-Minhal said, "I used to trade as a money-changer
and I asked Zayd ibn Arqam about it and he said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said...
<P>

and Zayd ibn Arqam about money-changing and they said, 'We used to be merchants
during the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and we asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, about money-changing and he said, "There is no harm if it is hand
to hand. If there is a delay, then it is not proper."'"

1956. It is related from 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Umayr that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari
asked for permission to go in to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab but he was refused
permission as he was busy. Abu Musa went away. When 'Umar became free, he
said, "Did I not hear the voice of 'Abdullah ibn Qays? Give him permission
to come in." He was told, "He has gone away." He then summoned him and he
(Abu Musa) said, "We were ordered to do that [i.e. to leave asking permission
to enter three times]." 'Umar said, "Bring me clear proof of that." So Abu
Musa went to the assembly of the Ansar and asked them and they said, "Only
the youngest of us, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, will testify to that." He brought
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and 'Umar said, "Has this command of the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, been concealed from me? Dealing
in the marketplace distracted me," i.e. going out to trade.
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Trading by sea</B>
<P>
Matar said, "There is no harm in it, and what Allah says about it in the
Qur'an is only the truth: <I>"And you see the ships cleaving through it so
that you can seek His bounty." </I>(16:14) <I>Fulk</I> means ships, and the
singular and plural are the same.

</I>with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a caravan

him and grant him peace, said, "When a woman gives away some of the food

of looking after it the same. The reward of one in no way diminishes that
of the others."
<P>

said,] "I heard him say, 'Evening does not find the family of Muhammad, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a<I> sa' </I>of wheat, or a <I>sa'
</I>of any grain,' and he had nine wives."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: A man's earning and his working with his own hands</B>
<P>
1964. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When Abu Bakr as-Siddiq was appointed

and he will use it to make a profit for the Muslims.'"

<P>
1966. It is related from al-Miqdam that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "No one eats any better food than someone

his own hands."

bless him and grant him peace, said, "Da'ud, peace be upon him, used only
to eat from what he earned by work of his own hand."

<P>
1969. It is related from az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam that the Prophet, may Allah

him and grant him peace,&nbsp;said, "The angels received the soul of one
of those who came before you and said, 'Did you do anything good?' He said,
'I used to order my employees to give the wealthy time to pay and to make
allowances for them.'" He said, "He said, 'Then make allowances for him.'"
<P>
Abu Malik said from Rib'i, "I used to make things easy for the wealthy and
give those in difficulties time to pay."

allowances for him, so that perhaps Allah will make allowances for us.' So
Allah made allowances for him."
<P>
<P>

and showing good faith</B>
<P>
It is mentioned that al-'Adda' ibn Khalid said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless

Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has purchased from al-'Adda'
ibn Khalid, a sale from one Muslim to another, with no hidden defect, no
taint and no wickedness (<I>gh&acirc;'ila</I> ) [i.e. in the slave sold.]."
<P>
Qatada said, "<I>Gh&acirc;'ila</I> means fornication, theft and being a runaway."
<P>
It was said to Ibrahim [an-Nakha'i], "Some drovers give themselves the name
of 'the stables of Khorasan and Sijistan' and say, 'It arrived from Khorasan
yesterday. It arrived from Sijistan today." He disliked that immensely.
<P>
'Uqba ibn 'Amir said, "It is not lawful for a Muslim to sell goods knowing
that there is a defect in them without mentioning it."
<P>
1973. It is related that Hakim ibn Hizam said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The seller and the buyer have the option
(to revoke the sale) as long as they have not separated (or he said, 'until
they separate'). If they speak the truth and make things clear, they will
be blessed in their sale. If they conceal and lie, the blessing of their
transaction will be obliterated."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: Selling mixed dates</B>
<P>
1974. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "We used to be given the worst sort
of dates, which are mixed dates, and we used to sell two sa's for one sa',

sa's</I> for one <I>sa' </I>nor two dirhams for one dirham.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: What is said about meat-sellers and butchers</B>
<P>
1975. It is related that Abu Mas'ud said, "One of the Ansar, whose
<I>kunya</I> was Abu Shu'ayb, came and said to a slave who was a butcher,
'Prepare enough food for five people. I want to invite the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, as one of five guests. I saw from his face
that he was hungry.' So he invited him and another man came along with them.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'This man has
followed us. If you want to give him permission, then give him permission,
and if you want him to return, he will return.' He said, 'No, I give him
permission.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: What lying and concealment wipe out in respect of a sale</B>
<P>
1976. It is related from Hakim ibn Hizam that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The seller and the buyer have the option
(to revoke the sale) as long as they have not separated (or he said, 'until
they separate'). If they speak the truth and make things clear, they will
be blessed in their sale. If they conceal and lie, the blessing of their
transaction will be wiped out."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"O you who believe! Do not feed
on usury, multiplied and then remultiplied. Show fear of Allah so that perhaps
you will be successful."</I> (3:130)</B>

care from what source he gets his livelihood nor whether it is <I>halal</I>
or <I>haram</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: Someone who takes usury, the witness to it and the person who writes
it down</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Those who practise usury will not rise from
the grave except as someone driven mad by Shaytan's touch. That is because
they say, 'Trade is the same as usury.' But Allah has permitted trade and
He has forbidden usury. Whoever is given a warning by his Lord and then desists,
can keep what he received in the past and his affair is up to Allah. But
all who return to it will be the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it
timelessly, forever." </I>(2:275)
<P>
1978. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the end of <I>Surat al-Baqara</I>
was revealed, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited
the verses in the mosque and then made trade in wine unlawful."
<P>
1979. It is related from Samura ibn Jundub that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "In the night I dreamt that two men came to
me and brought me to a holy land. We went on until we came to a river of
blood in the middle of which there was a man standing together with another
man carrying some stones in front of him. The man in the river came forward
and when he tried to get out, the other man threw a stone into his mouth
and he went back to where he had been before. Whenever he tried to get out,
the other would throw a stone in his mouth and he would go back to where
he had been before. I asked, 'What is this?' He said, 'The man you saw in
the river took usury.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: Someone who pays usury</B>
<P>
By the the words of the Almighty<I>, "O you who believe! Show fear of Allah
and forgo any remaining usury if you are believers. If you do not, know that
it means war from Allah and His Messenger. But if you turn in repentance
you may have your capital, without wronging and without being wronged. If
someone is in difficult circumstances, there should be a deferral until things
are easier. But making a free gift of it would be better for you if you only
knew. Show fear of a Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then every self
will be paid in full for what it earned. They will not be wronged."</I>
(2:278-281)
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "This was the last <I>ayat</I> to be revealed to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
1980. It is related that 'Awn ibn Abi Juhayfa said, "I saw my father buy
a slave who was a cupper. He ordered his cupping tools to be broken. I asked
him (about that). He said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, forbade taking money for a dog or blood, and he forbade tattooing
and being tattooed, and taking and paying usury, and he cursed people who
make images."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI<I>: "Allah obliterates usury but makes </I>sadaqa<I> grow in value.
Allah does not love any persistently ungrateful wrongdoer."</I> (2:276)</B>
<P>
1981. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Making oaths hastens the sale
of goods but eradicates the blessings."
<P>
[These are oaths which are untrue.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: The disapproved nature of swearing oaths while selling</B>
<P>
1982. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa that a man set up some goods
in the market and swore by Allah that he had been offered for them an amount
that he had not in fact been offered in order to entice a Muslim man into
buying them. So it was revealed<I>, "Those who sell Allah's contract and
their own oaths for a paltry price." </I>(3:77)
<P>
<P>

When I wanted to marry Fatima, peace be upon her, the daughter of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, I arranged with a goldsmith

feast."

Its thorn bushes may not be uprooted nor may its trees be cut down nor its
game hunted nor any dropped things picked up in it, except by someone who
announces that he has done so". Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib said, "Except
for the <I>idhkhir</I> plant for the use of our goldsmiths and the roofs
our houses!" The Prophet said, "Except for the <I>idhkhir</I> plant."

him to ask for its repayment. He said, 'I will not give it to you until you
reject Muhammad.' I said, 'I will not reject until Allah makes you die and
then you are resurrected from the dead.' He said, 'Then leave me until I
die and am resurrected. Then I will be given wealth and children and I will
pay you.' So it was revealed,<I> 'Have you seen him who rejects Our Signs

a cloak with a woven border." She said, "Messenger of Allah, I wove this
with my own hands so that you could wear it." The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, took it as he was in need of it. He came out to
us using it as a waist-wrapper." He continued, "A man of the people said,
'Messenger of Allah, let me wear it.' He said, 'Yes.' After sitting in the
gathering the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went home,
wrapped it up and sent it to him. The people said to him, 'That was not a
good thing you did. You asked him for it knowing that he never refuses anyone
who asks.' The man said, 'By Allah, I did not ask for it in order to wear
it. I asked for it only so that it could be my shroud on the day I die.'"

him. On the day of <I>Jumu'a</I>, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, sat on the minbar which had been made. The palm-tree where he
used to give the <I>khutba</I> cried out until it almost split apart. The

I said, 'My camel is slow and tired out, so I have fallen behind.' He got
down and poked it with his stick and said, 'Now get on.' So I got on and
had to restrain it from rushing ahead of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.'
He said, 'A virgin or a woman who was married previously?' I said, 'A woman
who was married previously.' He said, 'Why not a virgin whom you could play
with and who could play with you?' I said, 'I have sisters and I wanted to
marry a woman who could bring them together and comb their hair and take
care of them.' He said, 'You will reach home, and when you do so, have
intercourse with your wife.' Then he said, 'Will you sell me your camel?'
I said, 'Yes.' So he bought it from me for an <I>awqiya</I>. Then the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on ahead of me. I
arrived in the morning. We went to the mosque and I found him at the door
of the mosque. He said, "Have you only just arrived?' I said, 'Yes.' He said,
'Leave your camel and go in and pray two <I>rak'ats</I>.' I went in and prayed.
He instructed Bilal to weigh out an <I>awqiya</I> for me, and Bilal weighed
it for me and was generous in the weighing. I left. He said, 'Call Jabir

and then goes to the mosque with no other object than to do the prayer and
only impelled by the prayer, Allah will raise him up a degree with every
step he takes, and a wrong action will fall away from him. The angels pray

by Allah, some of the characteristics by which he is described in the Qur'an
can also be found in the Torah: "O Prophet, We have sent you as a witness,
a bringer of good news and a warner and a refuge for the unlettered. You
are My slave and My Messenger. I have called you the one in whom people put
their trust, one who is neither coarse nor vulgar and who neither shouts
in the markets nor repays evil with evil, but rather pardons and forgives.
Allah will not take him back to Himself until the crooked community has been
put straight by him and they say, 'There is no god but Allah.' Through him,blind
eyes, deaf ears and covered hearts will be opened."'"

do it. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me,
'Go and divide up your dates into different categories, the<I> 'ajwa
</I>(excellent dates) on one side, the <I>'adhq Zayd</I> (inferior dates)
on the other side and then send for me.' I did this and then I sent to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He sat at the head or in
the middle of them and then said, 'Measure for the people.' I measured for
them until they had received what they were owed in full and my dates remained
as if they had not been decreased at all.'"

was informed of it and said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, has only come at this hour because something has happened. When
he came in to him, he said to Abu Bakr, 'Send out those who are with you.'
He said, 'Messenger of Allah, they are my two daughters,' i.e. 'A'isha and
Asma'. He said, 'Are you aware that I have been given permission to leave?'

a garment by touching it without examining it."
<P>
2038. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Two kinds of dress are forbidden:
(one of which is) a man in a single garment sitting with his legs drawn up

or any other animal unmilked</B>
<P>
<I>Musarra</I> is an animal whose milk has been allowed to collect and gather
in her udder, and which has not been milked for days. The root meaning of
<I>tasriya</I> is to stop water flowing. When someone stops water flowing,
he says "<I>sarraytu</I>."
<P>
2041. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Do not leave camels and sheep unmilked. Anyone
who buys an animal in that condition has one of two options after it has
been milked: if he wishes, he can keep it, and if he wishes, he can return
it together with a <I>sa' </I>of dates."
<P>

grant him peace, "A <I>sa' </I>of dates."

for three days."
<P>

three days. "Dates" occurs the most often (rather than "food") in the narration.
<P>
2042. It is related that Ibn Mas'ud said, "Anyone who buys an unmilked sheep
can return it, and should return a<I> sa' </I>of dates with it. The Prophet,

go out to meet caravans, do not bid against one another, bidding merely in
order to raise the price, and townsmen should not sell on behalf of men of
the desert, and do not leave sheep unmilked - anyone who buys an animal in
that condition has one of two options after it has been milked: if he is
pleased with it, he keep it, and if he is displeased with it, he can return
it together with a <I>sa' </I>of dates."

Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When a female slave commits
fornication and her fornication is proven, then a man should flog her and
not blame her. If she commits fornication again, he should flog her and not
blame her. If she commits fornication a third time, he should sell her, even
for a rope made of hair."
<P>
2046. It is related from Abu Hurayra and Zayd ibn Khalid that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked about a female
slave when she commits fornication outside of marriage. He said, "If she
commits fornication, flog her. If she commits fornication again, flog her.
Then if she commits fornication again, sell her, even for a hair rope."
<P>
Ibn Shihab said, "I don't know whether it was after the third or fourth time."
<P>

<P>
2047. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah

to him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Buy her and set her free.' In the evening the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, got up and praised Allah as He should be praised
and then said, 'Why is it that some people make conditions which are not
in the Book of Allah? Any condition which is not in the Book of Allah is
invalid even if it is stipulated a hundred times. The conditions of Allah
are more binding and firmer.'"
<P>
2048. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar &#163; that 'A'isha looked into
buying Barira and he (the Prophet) went out for the prayer. When he came
back, she said, 'They refuse to sell her except on the condition that they
keep the <I>wala'</I>.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'The<I> wala' </I>goes to the one who sets free.'"
<P>
Hammam said, "I asked Nafi', 'Was her husband a free man or a slave?' He
replied, 'I do not know.'"

obey, and offer sincere counsel to every Muslim."

of the desert."

behalf of a man of the desert."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXI: The prohibition against going out to meet caravans. The sale of
anyone who who buys from them is invalid because the person who does it is
a rebellious sinner when he does it knowingly and it is therefore deceit
in the sale, and deceit is not permitted</B>

should return a<I> sa' </I>together with it. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, forbade going out to meet caravans."

one <I>awqiya</I> per year. Can you help me.' I said, 'If your people like,
I will count it out for them (in full) and your <I>wala' </I>will then belong
to me. I will do that.' Barira went to her people, told them but they rejected
it. She came from them when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was sitting there. She said, 'I proposed that to them and
they refused unless they can keep the wala'.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was listening and 'A'isha told the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, all about it. He said, 'Take her and
make it conditional on receiving the <I>wala'.</I> The <I>wala' </I>belongs
to the one who sets free.' 'A'isha did that and then the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up among the people and praised
and glorified Allah and then said, 'Following on from that: Why is it that
some men make conditions which are not in the Book of Allah? Any condition
which is not in the Book of Allah is invalid even if it is stipulated a hundred
times. The decision of Allah is more binding and the condition of Allah is
firmer. The <I>wala' </I>belongs to the one who sets free.'"
<P>
2061. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin,
wanted to buy a slavegirl and free her and her people said, "We will sell

and said, 'By Allah, do not leave him until you have taken it from him! The

from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, or do you find
it in the Book of Allah?" He said, "I do not say that and you have more knowledge
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, than
me. However, Usama reported to me that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and

bless him and grant him peace, made a dispensation after that for
<I>'ariyya</I> sales (i.e. selling fruit on the tree for fresh or dried dates),
but did not make any other dispensation.
<P>
<A HREF="muw11.html#23">2073</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade
the <I>muzabana</I> sale.

<P>
<A HREF="muw11.html#14">2076</A>. It is related from Zayd ibn Thabit that

<P>
2077. It is related that Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, forbade selling fresh dates until it was clear that they
were sound and no dates should be sold except for dinars or dirhams except
in the case of the <I>'ariyya.</I>"
<P>
<A HREF="muw11.html#14*">2078</A>. Someone was asked whether it was related
from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
had allowed <I>'ariyya </I>sales for five <I>awqiyas</I> or less than five
<I>awqiyas</I>. He said, "Yes."
<P>
2079. It is related from Sahl ibn Abi Hathma that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the sale of fresh dates
for dried days but allowed the <I>'ariyya </I>to be sold by estimate and
their owners to eat them fresh.
<P>
Sufyan said another time that there was a dispensation in the case of the
<I>'ariyya </I>for the owner to sell them by estimate and eat them fresh.
He said, "It is the same."
<P>
Sufyan said, "I said to Yahya when I was a boy, 'The people of Makka say
that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, allowe<I>d 'ariyya
s</I>ales.' He said, 'How do the people of Makka know that?' I said, 'They
relate it from Jabir.' He was silent."
<P>
Sufyan said, "I meant that Jabir was one of the people of Madina. It was
said to Sufyan, "Is there is no prohibition against selling dates before
they begin to ripen?' 'No,'" he replied.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXIV: The explanation of <I>'ariyya</I></B>
<P>
Malik said, "An <I>'ariyya </I>is when a man assigns [the produce of] a date-palm
to another man and then is troubled by his coming to him and is therefore
allowed to buy its dates from him in return for dried dates.
<P>
Ibn Idris said, "The <I>'ariyya </I>can only be transacted with measured
dates from hand to hand, and may not be done unmeasured and unweighed." One
thing that strengthens that statement is the what Sahl ibn Abi Hathma said,
"by measured <I>wasqs</I>."

When the people harvested the dates and it was time for people's accounts
to be settled, the buyers would say, 'These dates are rotten. They have got
a disease. They have a disease which makes them fall before they are ripe.'
They would offer faults as excuses. Once when there was a lot of quarrelling
in his presence about that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'No, do not sell to one another until it is clear
that they are sound,' as if it was advice he was giving due to the great
amount of their quarrelling."

the Pleaides appeared and the yellow ones could be distinguished from the
red.

any one of you to take his brother's money?"

"One of them said, 'O Allah, my parents are old and I used to go out and
pasture the animals and then I would come and milk them and bring the milk
to my parents who would drink it. Then I would let my children, wife and
family drink. One night I was delayed and when I came they were both asleep.'"

at my feet. Things remained like that until dawn. O Allah, if you know that
I did that out of the desire for Your pleasure, then open the way for us
so we can see the sky!'" He said, "A gap opened for them.

"Another said, 'O Allah! You know that I used to love one of my uncle's daughters
with the most intense love a man can have for a woman and she said, that
I could not have my way with her unless I paid her a hundred dinars. I worked
hard until I had collected the sum and when I was sitting between her legs,
she said, "Fear Allah and do not break the hymen without the right to do
so." I got up and left her. If You know that I did that out of the desire
for Your pleasure, then open the way for us!'" He said, "It opened two-thirds
of the way for them.
<P>
"The other said, 'O Allah! You know that I employed a worker for a
<I>farq</I> of millet and then when I offered it to him, he refused to take
it. I sowed that <I>farq</I> and cultivated it and with it bought cows and

<P>
Allah Almighty says, <I>"Allah has favoured some of you over others in provision,

beautiful of women. He sent a message to him asking, 'Ibrahim, who is this
woman with you?' He answered, 'My sister.' Then Ibrahim returned to her and
said, 'Do not contradict what I have said. I have told them that you are
my sister. By Allah, there are no believers on the earth except me and you.'
Ibrahim sent her to the king. He went to her and she got up and did <I>wudu'
</I>and prayed and said, 'O Allah, I believe in You and Your Messenger and
I have protected my private parts from everyone but my husband. Do not give
the unbeliever power over me.' He began to make snorting noises and his legs
started thrashing about."

and I have protected my private parts from everyone but my husband. Do not
give the unbeliever power over me.' He began to make snorting noises and
his legs started thrashing about."

Abu Hurayra said, "She said, 'O Allah, if he dies, it will be said that I
killed him." Then after the second or third time, the king sent a message
saying, 'By Allah, you have only sent me a devil! Return her to Ibrahim and
give her Ajar.' She returned to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and said, 'Are
you aware that Allah has humiliated the unbeliever and given us a slavegirl?'"

that he is his son. See whom he resembles!' 'Abd ibn Zam'a said, 'Messenger
of Allah. this is my brother. He was born on my father's bed to his slavegirl.'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked to
see whom he resembled and saw a clear resemblance to 'Utba. He said, 'He
