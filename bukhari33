It is said that it is a name, as was stated by Shurayhibn Abi Awfa al-'Abasi:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <I>HaMim</I> reminds me when the spear is thrust  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; will he not recite <I>HaMim</I> before the advance?  <P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Mujahid said that <I>"to salvation" </I>(40:41) refers to faith. <I>"Hasno foundation" </I>(40:43) refers to an idol. "<I>Yushajrun</I>" (40:72)is to kindle fire on them and "<I>tamrahun</I>" (40:75) means "to exult".<P>Al-'Ala' ibn Ziyad used to remind people about the Fire. A man asked, 'Whydo you make people despair?" He answered, "Am I able to make people despairwhen Allah Almighty says, <I>'O my slaves, you who have transgressed againstyourselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah'</I> (39:53) and He says,<I>'The profligate will be Companions of the Fire.' </I>(40:43)? Rather youwant to have the good news of the Garden in spite of your evil deeds. Allahsent Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to give those whoobey Allah the good news of the Garden and to warn those who disobey Himof the Fire."<P>4537. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said, "I asked 'Abdullah ibn'Amr ibn al-'As to tell me the worst thing that the idolaters did to theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'Whilethe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was praying in theHijr of the Ka'ba, 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt came and put his cloak around hisneck and began to choke him with it severely. Abu Bakr came forward and grabbedhis shoulders and pushed him away from him saying,<I> "Are you going to killa man for saying, 'My Lord is Allah'? when he has brought you Clear Signsfrom your Lord?"</I> (40:28)'"<P><P><FONT COLOR="#35040b"><B><BIG>CCCI: Tafsir of <I>Surat HaMim as-Sajda</I>(<I>Fussilat</I>)</BIG></B></FONT><P>Tawus reported from Ibn 'Abbas that <I>"i'tina taw'an</I>" (41:11) means"Give". "They said, <I>'We came willingly'" </I>(41:11) means "We gave".<P>4537. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that a man said to Ibn 'Abbas, "I find inthe Qur'an things which seem to be contradictory to me. Allah says, <I>'ThatDay there will be no family ties between them; they will not be able to questionone another,'</I> (23:101) and He says, <I>'And they will confront one another,questioning one another.</I>' (37:27) He says, <I>'They will not be ablehide a single circumstance from Allah' </I>(4:42) and He says, <I>'By Allah,our Lord, we were not mushrikun," </I>(6:23) and they are hiding in thisayat.<P>"He says,<I> 'The heaven &#150; built it </I>... to ... <I>and that He smoothedout the earth'</I> (79:27-30), in which He mentions the creation of heavenbefore the creation of the earth. Then He says, <I>'Do you reject Him Whocreated the earth in two days </I>... to ... <I>willingly.' </I>(41:9-11)and here He mentions the creation of the earth before the heaven.<P>"Allah says, <I>'Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful' </I>(4:96)<I>,'Almighty, All-Wise,' </I>(4:56) <I>and 'All-Hearing, All-Seeing.'</I> (4:58)This is as if it were about the past."*<P>Ibn 'Abbas said<I>, "'There will be no family ties between them</I>' is atthe first blast of the Trumpet when it is blown: <I>'The Trumpet will beblown and those in the heavens and those in the earth will all loseconsciousness, except such those Allah wills.' </I>(39:68) Then there willbe no relationships and they will not ask after one another. Then when theTrumpet is blown the second time, '<I>And they will confront one another,questioning one another</I>.' (37:27)<P>"As for His words<I>, 'We were not mushrikun' </I>and '<I>They will not beable hide a single circumstance from Allah</I>,' Allah will forgive the wrongactions of the people of sincerity. Then the idolaters will say, 'Come, letus say that we were not idolaters!' Then their mouths will be sealed andtheir hands will speak (the truth). At that time it will be known that nota single fact can be concealed from Allah and then<I> 'those who rejectedwill wish...'</I> (4:42)<P>"He created the earth in two days and then created the heaven. Then He turnedto the heaven and then He arranged them in two further days. Then He spreadout the earth and its spreading out is that He brought water and pastureout of it and created mountains, camels, hillocks and what is between themin another two days. That is His words<I>, "He smoothed it out'</I> and Hiswords, <I>"He created the earth in two days.'</I> So earth and everythingin it was created in four days, and the heavens were created in two days.<P>"Allah said of Himself, <I>'Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful,' </I>andthat is His Word. In other words, that continues to be so. If Allah wishessomething, then He accomplishes whatever He wills. The Qur'an should appearcontradictory to you. All is from Allah."<P>This is related from al-Minhal.<P>Mujahid said tha<I>t "for them is a wage which never fails" </I>(41:8) means"not calculated." "<I>Aqwataha</I>" (41:10) means "their provisions". <I>"Herevealed, in every heaven, its own mandate" </I>(41:12) is that to whichit was commanded. "<I>Nahisat</I>" (41:16) means inauspicious days.<I> "Wehave assigned them close comrades" </I>(41:25) means "We have joined to them".<I>"The angels descend on them" </I>(41:30) means when they are dying.<I>"Ihtazzat"</I> (quivers) with plants and "<I>rabat</I>" (41:39) "swells"means it become taller.<P>Another said that <I>"from its husk" </I>(41:47) is when they emerge. <I>"Thenhe says, 'This is my due.'" </I>(41:50), i.e. on account of my actions andso I am entitled to this. <I>"Sawa'an li's-sa'ilin" </I>(41:10) means Hedetermined them the same<I>. "We guided them"</I> (41:17) means "We guidedthem in good and bad," and that is like His words, <I>"We have shown himthe two highways" (</I>90:10) and "<I>We guided him on &nbsp;the Way."</I>(76:3) The guidance is right guidance, which is like "We caused him toascend." Part of that is His words, <I>"They are the ones Allah has guided,so be guided by their guidance."</I> (6:90) <I>"Yuza'una" </I>(41:19) means"forced" and "<I>min akmamiha</I>" (41:47) refers to the skin of the sheath.Another said that it refers to grape vines when the flower and sheath emergesfrom them.<I> "wali hamim" </I>(41:34) means "bosom friend". In <I>"min mahis"</I>(41:48), <I>mahis</I> (escape) comes from <I>hasa</I> (to escape)."<I>Mirya</I>" (41:54) meaning "doubt" is the same as "<I>murya</I>".<P>Mujahid said that <I>"Do what you will" </I>(41:40) is a threat.<P>Ibn 'Abbas said that<I> "Repel the bad with what is better" </I>(41:34) meanssteadfastness in anger and pardon when being badly treated. When they actin that way, Allah protects them and their enemy is humbled to them, <I>"hewill be like a bosom friend." </I><P>[* The point being that the past tense, <I>kana</I>, is used in these ayats.]<P><P><B>CCCII: His words, <I>"You did not think to shield yourselves from yourhearing, sight and skin testifying against you and you thought that Allahwould never know much of what you did." </I>(41:22)</B><P>4538. It is related from Ibn Mas'ud about the ayat, "<I>You did not thinkto shield yourselves from your hearing, sight and skin testifying againstyou </I>...", "Two men of Quraysh and their in-law from Thaqif, or two menfrom Thaqif and their in-law from Quraysh, were in ahouse and one of themsaid to another, 'Do you think that Allah can hear what we say?' One of themsaid, 'He hears some of it.' Another said, 'If he can hear some of it, Hecan hear all of it.' Then there was revealed, '<I>You did not think to shieldyourselves from your hearing, sight and skin testifying against you!</I>'(41:22)"<P><P><B>CCCIII: His words,<I> "It is that thought you had about your Lord thathas destroyed you so now you find yourselves among the lost." </I>(41:23)</B><P>4539. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "Two men of Quraysh and one of Thaqif,or two men of Thaqif and one of Quraysh, met near the House. All of themhad fat bellies and little understanding in their hearts. One of them said,'Do you think that Allah hears what we say?' Another said, 'He hears if wetalk out loud, but doe not hear us when we whisper.' The third said, 'IfHe can hear us when we speak out loud, then He can hear us when we whisper.'Then Allah Almighty revealed,<I> 'You did not think to shield yourselvesfrom your hearing, sight and skin testifying against you!' </I>(41:22)"<P>A different <I>isnad</I>.<P>His words, <I>"If they are steadfast, the Fire will still be their residence!"</I>(41:25)<P>4540.

It is related that Ibn 'Abbas was asked about His words, <I>"exceptfor you to love your near of kin." </I>(42:23) Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "Itis the relatives of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." Ibn'Abbas said, "You have been hasty. There is no branch of Quraysh but thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has relatives in it.He said, 'I only want to maintain good ties with my relatives."<P><P><FONT COLOR="#2e0207"><B><BIG>CCCVI: The Tafsir of <I>Surat HaMim</I>,<I>az-Zukhruf</I></BIG></B></FONT><P>Mujahid said tha<I>t "'Ala umma" </I>(43:22, 23) refers to an imam and the<I>tafsir</I> of <I>"His words, 'O my Lord'" </I>(43:88) is "Do you reckonthat we do not hear their secrets and secret talks and we do not hear theirwords?"<P>Ibn 'Abbas said that<I> "Were it not that mankind might all become onenation"</I> (43:33) means "Were it not that all people would be unbelievers,We would have provided for the houses of the unbelievers 'silver roofs fortheir houses and stairways' (43:33) made of silver."

If he says, <I>"bari",</I> then one says<I>"bari'an"</I> for two and <I>"bari'un"</I> for the plural. 'Abdullah recited<I>"Innani bari'un"</I> with ya'.

The titlefor each of them was <I>"tubba'" </I>because they succeeded one another.A shadow is also called <I>"tubba'"</I> because it follows the sun.<P><P><B>CCCIX: <I>"So be on the watch for a day when heaven brings forth a distinctivesmoke." </I>(44:10)</B><P>Qatada said that "<I>fartaqib</I>" (44:10) means "to wait for"<P>4543.

'This is a painful punishment!'"</I>(44:11)</B><P>4544. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "This occurred because when Qurayshdisobeyed the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he invokedaggainst them years of drought like the years of Yusuf. So they were afflictedby a drought and exhaustion until they ate bones. It reached the point thata man would look at the sky and see something like a smoke between him andit because of exhaustion. So Allah revealed, <I>'So be on the watch for aday when heaven brings forth a distinctive smoke, which enshrouds mankind."This is a painful punishment!"' </I>(44:10-11) Then the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was approached and it was said,'Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to give rain to Mudar. They are destroyed.'He said, 'For Mudar? You are a bold man.' So he prayed for rain and theyhad rain. Then it was revealed, <I>'you will revert.' </I>(44:15) When theyenjoyed prosperity. they reverted to their state when they were comfortable.So Allah revealed,<I> 'On the day We launch the Great Assault We will certainlyhave Our revenge.'</I> (44:16)." He said that it meant the Day of Badr.<P><P><B>CCCXI: <I>"Our Lord, remove the punishment from us. We are reallybelievers."</I> (44:12)</B><P>4545. It is related that Masruq said, "I visited 'Abdullah and he said, 'Partof knowledge is that you say about what you do not know, 'Allah knows best.'Allah said to His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,<I> 'Say:"I do not ask you for any wage for it, nor am I a mand of falsepretensions.</I>"' (38:86) When Quraysh refused to obey the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and refused to follow him, he said,'O Allah, help me against them with seven years like the years of Yusuf.'They were afflicted by a year of drought in which they ate bones and carrionout of desperation. One of them would see something like smoke between himand the sky due to hunger. They said, <I>'Our Lord, remove the punishmentfrom us. We are really believers.' </I>(44:12) It was said to him, 'If Weremove it from them, they will revert.' So he called on his Lord and it wasremoved from them and they reverted and Allah exacted vengeance on them onthe Day of Badr. That is the words of the Almighty, <I>'On the day We launchthe Great Assault We will certainly have Our revenge.'</I> (44:16)."<P><P><B>CCCXII:<I> "How can they expect a Reminder when a clear Messenger hasalready come to them?"</I> (44:13)</B><P><I>Dhikr</I> and <I>dhikra</I> mean the same.<P>4546. It is related that Masruq said, "I visited 'Abdullah and he said, "Whenthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, summonedQuraysh, they denied him and refused to obey him. He said, "O Allah, helpme against them with seven years like the years of Yusuf." They were afflictedby a year of drought which destroyed everything, so that they started eatingcarrion. One of them would stand and see something like smoke between himand the sky due to exhaustion and hunger.' Then he recited, '<I>So be onthe watch for a day when heaven brings forth a distinctive smoke, which enshroudsmankind. "This is a painful punishment!"</I>... to ...<I> 'We remove thepunishment a little, and you revert!' </I>(44:10-15)." 'Abdullah said, Willthe punishment be removed from them on the Day of Rising?" and he said, "TheGreat Assault is the Day of the Battle of Badr."<P><P><B>CCCXIII: <I>"Then they turned away from him and said, '"An instructedmadman!'" </I>(44:14)</B><P>4547. It is related from Masruq that 'Abdullah said, "Allah sent Muhammad,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, '<I>Say: "I do not askyou for any wage for it, nor am I a mand of false pretensions</I>."' (38:86)When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sawthat Quraysh refused to obey him, he said, 'O Allah, help me against themwith seven years like the years of Yusuf.' They were afflicted by a yearof drought which destroyed everything, so that they ate bones and skins.(One of them said, 'Until they ate skins and carrion.') Something resemblingsmoke began to come out of the earth. Abu Sufyan went to him and said, 'OMuhammad, your people are destroyed. Pray to Allah to remove that from them.'He prayed and then he said, 'You will revert after this.'"<P>In the hadith of Mansur, then he recited, "<I>So be on the watch for a daywhen heaven brings forth a distinctive smoke</I> ...to ...<I>and</I> <I>you revert</I>." (44:10-15) and said, "Will the punishment of the Next Worldbe removed? The Smoke, the Blow, and the Punishment have already occurred."One of them said, "the moon" and another said, "the Romans."<P><P><B>CCCXIV: "'<I>On the day We launch the Great Assault We will certainlyhave Our revenge</I>."

If what you claim is sound, then it is not proper for that tobe worshipped. It does not mean seeing with the eye. It is like, "Do youknow?"

'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr said something to him and Marwanordered, 'Seize him!' 'Abdu'r-Rahman entered 'A'isha's house and so theycould not get him. Marwan said, 'This is the one about whom Allah revealed,"<I>But what of him who says to his parents, 'Fie on you! Do you promiseme</I>...'" 'A'isha spoke up from behind the screen, 'Allah did not revealany of the Qur'an about us except for what Allah revealed of my innocence.'"<P>[*i.e. as Amir of Madina.

He usedto smile." She said, "Whenever he saw a cloud or wind, his worry could beseen in his face.
