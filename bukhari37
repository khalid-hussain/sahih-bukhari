The Book of Foods</BIG></B><P><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Eat of the good things things We have providedyou" </I>(2:57, 2:172; 7:160; 20:81) and <I>"Give away some of the good thingswhich you have earned" </I>(2:267) and His words, <I>"Eat of the good thingsand act rightly. I most certainly know what you do." </I>(23:51)<P><P>5058. It is related from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Feed the hungry, visit the sick andfree captives." Sufyan said that <I>al-'ani </I>means "captive".<P>5059. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The family of Muhammad, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, did not eat their fill for three days in arow until he died."<P>5060. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "While I was suffering from extremeexhaustion, I met 'Umar ibn al-Khattab. I asked him to recite an <I>ayat</I>of the Qur'an to me. He entered his house and recited it to me. Then I walkedonly a short distance and fell on my face out of exhaustion and hunger. Suddenlythe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standingat my head. He said, 'Abu Hirr.' I answered, 'At your service, Messengerof Allah!' He took my hand and helped me up and recognised what was wrongwith me. He took me to his house and commanded I be brought a large bowlof milk and I drank from it. He said, 'Again! Drink, Abu Hirr.' So I drankagain. He said, 'Again!' So I drank again until my stomach was distendedlike a bowl. Then I met 'Umar and told him what had happened. I said to him,'Allah put someone in charge of that who was more entitled to it than you,'Umar. By Allah, I asked you to recite that ayat when I know it better thanyou.' 'Umar then said, 'By Allah, I would have preferred to bring you inthan having the like of red camels!'"<P><P><B>I. Saying the Name of Allah over food and eating with the right hand</B><P>5061. It is related that 'Umar ibn Abi Salama said, "I was a boy in the careof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and myhand used to go all around in the plate. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'Boy, say the name of Allah andeat with your right hand and eat from what is in front of you.' That hasbeen the way I have eaten ever since."<P><P><B>II. Eating from what is in front of you</B><P>Anas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"Say the Name of Allah and every man should eat from what is in front ofhim."<P>5062. It related that 'Umar ibn Abi Salama, the son of Umm Salama, the wifeof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "One day Iate some food with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace. I began to eat from all sides of the plate and the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told me, 'Eat from what isin front of you.'"<P>5063. It is related that Wahb ibn Kaysan Abi Nu'aym said. "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought some foodwhile his step-son, 'Umar ibn Abi Salama, was with him. He said, 'Say theName of Allah and eat from what is in front of you.'"<P><P><B>III. Moving around the bowl with a companion when he does not see thathe dislikes that</B><P>5064. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "A tailor invited the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for some food which hehad prepared." Anas said, "I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, following the pumpkin around the plate." Anas said,"I have loved pumpkin since that day."<P><P><B>IV. Using the right hand for eating and other things.</B><P>'Umar ibn Abi Salama said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, told me, 'Eat with your right hand.'"<P>5065. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, liked to begin with the right in all matters as muchas possible in his purification, putting on his shoes, and combing."<P>Shu'ba said before this in Wasit, "In all his affairs."<P><P><B>V. The one who ate until he was full</B><P>5066. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "Abu Talha saidto Umm Sulaym, 'I heard the voice of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and it was weak and I recognised hunger in it. Doyou have anything?' She produced some barley loaves. She took a scarf ofhers and wrapped up the bread in part of it and then she put it under mygarment and tied the rest of it round me. Then she sent me to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I took it with me.I found the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,sitting in the mosque with some people. I stood over them and the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked me, 'Did Abu Talhasend you?' I answered, 'Yes.' He said, 'With food?' I said, 'Yes.' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to those with him,'Get up.' Then he set off and I went on ahead of them until I came to AbuTalha and informed him. Abu Talha said, 'Umm Sulaym! The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has come with some people, and wedo not have anything to feed them.' She said, 'Allah and His Messenger knowbest.' Abu Talha went to meet the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, went forward with him until they both entered and the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Bring what youhave, Umm Sulaym.' So she brought that bread and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded it to be broken up andthen Umm Sulaym squeezed some ghee on it to flavour it.' Then the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said what Allah willedover it and then he said, 'Admit ten,' and he admitted them. They ate untilthey were full and then went out. Then he said, 'Admit ten' and he admittedthem. They ate until they were full and then went out. Then he said, 'Admitten' and he admitted them and so on until all the people had eaten and werefull, and there were eighty men."<P>5067. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr said, "There were ahundred and thirty of us with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'Doesany of you have any food with him?' One man had about a <I>sa' </I>of foodwhich was kneaded. Then a very tall man who was an idolworshipper came withsome sheep he was driving. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, asked, 'Are they for sale or a gift?' (or he said '<I>hiba</I>' insteadof '<I>'atiyya</I>') He replied, 'For sale.' So he bought a sheep from himand it was slaughtered. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,commanded that its inner organs be roasted. By Allah, there was not one amongthe one hundred and thirty to whom the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, did not give a piece of its liver, If he was present, he gaveit to him, and if he was absent, he kept it for him. He put it into two largebowls and everyone ate and we were full and there were two bowls extra whichwe carried on the camel,' or words to that effect.<P>5068. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, died when we had our fill of the two black ones: datesand water.'"<P><P><B>VI.<I> "There is no objection to the blind, no objection to the lame,no objection to the sick nor to yourselves for eating in your own housesor your fathers' houses or your mothers' houses or your brothers' housesor your sisters' houses or the houses of your paternal uncles or paternalaunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or maternal aunts or places towhich you own the keys or those of your friends. There is nothing wrong foryou in eating together or eating separately. And when you enter houses greetone another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and good. In this way Allahmakes the Signs clear to you so that perhaps you may use your intellect."</I>(24:61)</B><P><I>An-Nahd</I>* and gathering together for food.<P>[<I>Nahd</I> is gathering together the food which different travellers haveabnd then sharing it out equally between them.]<P>5069. It is related that Suwayd ibn an-Nu'man said, "We set out for Khaybarwith the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Whenwe were at as-Sahba' (and Yahya says that it a day's journey from Khaybar),the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked forfood. Only sawiq* was brought. We chewed and ate it. Then he called for waterand rinsed his mouth out and we did so as well, and then he led us in<I>Maghrib</I> without repeating wudu'."<P>Sufyan said, "I heard it from him, beginning to end."<P>[*<A NAME="sawiq">sawiq</A>: a mush made of wheat or barley.]<P><P><B>VII. Thin bread and eating at a table or on tablecloths(<I>sufra</I>)</B><P>5070. It is related that Qatada said, "We were with Anas who had his bakerwith him. He said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,never ate thin bread or a roasted sheep until he met Allah.'"<P>5071. It is related from Qatada that Anas said, "I do not know that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ever ate from a saucer* at all orate thin bread nor ate at a table at all." Qatada was asked, "What did theyused to eat on?" "On tablecloths," he answered.<P>[* <I>Sukurruja</I>: a small bowl-shaped vessel in which things like saladwere put.]<P>5072. Humayd heard Anas say, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, stopped to consummate his marriage with Safiyya, I invitedthe Muslims to his wedding feast. He ordered that leather mats be spreadout and then dates, dried curd and ghee were put on them." 'Amr reportedthat Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,consummated his marriage and then put hays on a leather mat."<P>5073. It is related that Wahb ibn Kaysan said, "The people of Syria insultedIbn az-Zubayr, calling him, 'The son of the woman with two belts.' Asma'said to him, 'my son, they insult you with the two belts. Do you know whatthe two belts were? It was my belt which I divided in half. I tied the waterskinof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, withone of them and tied the food container with the other.' So when the peopleof Syria insulted him with the two belts, he would say. 'Yes, by Allah, "itis a fault of which the disgrace is far from you."*'"<P>[* This is half of a line of poetry by Kuthayyir or Abu Dhu'ayb.]<P>5074. It is reported from Ibn 'Abbas that Umm Hufayd bint al-Harith ibn Hazn,the aunt of Ibn 'Abbas, gave the Prophet some ghee, dried curd and lizards.He invited people to eat them and they were eaten on his table and the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left them as if he found themdistasteful. If that had been <I>haram</I>, they would not have been eatenon the table of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, nor commanded that they be eaten."<P><P><B>VIII. <A HREF="#sawiq">Sawiq</A></B><P>5075. It is related that Suwayd ibn an-Nu'man said, "We were with the Messengerof Allah, Messenger of Allah at as-Sahba', which is a day's journey fromKhaybar. The time for the prayer and he called for food, but there was only<I>sawiq</I> to be found. He chewed some of it and we chewed with him. Thenhe called for water and rinsed his mouth out and prayed and we praying withhim, and he did not repeat wudu'."<P><P><B>IX. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used not toeat anything until it was named for him so that he knew what it was</B><P>5076. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that Khalid ibn al-Walid, who was calledthe Sword of Allah, informed him that he went with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to Maymuna. She was both his maternalaunt and the maternal aunt of Ibn 'Abbas. He found that she had a roastedlizard which her sister, Hufayda bint al-Harith, had brought from Najd. Sheoffered the lizard to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace. He rarely stretched his hand towards food until he had been toldabout it and it had been named for him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, reached for the lizard and one of the womenpresent said, 'Tell the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, what you have offered him. It is lizard, Messenger of Allah.'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took hishand away from the lizard. Khalid ibn al-Walid asked, 'Is lizard<I>haram</I>, Messenger of Allah?' 'No,' he answered, 'but it is not foundin the land of my people and I find that I dislike it.' Khalid said, 'I pulledit to me and ate it while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, was looking at me.'"<P><P><B>X. Food for one is enough for two</B><P>5077. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'The food of two is enough for threeand the food of three is enough for four.'"<P><P><B>XI. A believer eats in one intestine</B><P>5078. It is related that Nafi' said, "Ibn 'Umar used to not eat until a poorman was brought to eat with him. I brought in a man who ate with him andate a lot. He said, 'Nafi', do not admit this man to me. I heard the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'A believer eats in one intestineand the unbeliever eats in seven.'"<P>5079. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'A believer eats in one intestine andthe unbeliever &#150; or hypocrite &#150; eats in seven."<P>The like of it is reported from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace.<P>5080. It is related that 'Amr said, "Abu Nahil was a man who ate a lot. Ibn'Umar said to him, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "The unbeliever eats in seven intestines."' He said, 'I believe inAllah and His Messenger.'"<P>5081. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The Muslim eats in one intestine andthe unbeliever eats in seven."<P>5082. It is related from Abu Hurayra that a man used to eat a lot. He becameMuslim and then he used to eat a little. That was mentioned to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, "The believer eatsin one intestine and the unbeliever eats in seven."<P><P><B>XII.

Roasted meat</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"He bought a roasted calf." </I>(11:69),<I>Hanidh</I> means "roasted".<P>5085. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that Khalid ibn al-Walid said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought a roasted lizard andreached for it to eat it. He was told that it was a lizard and he withdrewhis hand. Khalid asked, 'Is it <I>haram</I>?' He said, 'No, but it is notin the land of my people and I find that I dislike it.' Khalid ate whilethe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was watching.'"Malik reported from Ibn Shihab that it was a roasted lizard.<P><P><B>XIV. <I>Khazira</I> (Bran broth)</B><P>An-Nadr said, "<I>Khazira</I> is made with bran and <I>harira</I> is madewith milk.<P>5086. It is related by Ibn Shihab from Mahmud ibn ar-Rabi' al-Ansari that'Itban ibn Malik al-Ansari, one of those who was present at Badr, went tothe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,"Messenger of Allah, my eyesight is weak and I lead my people in the prayer.When it rains, the water floods the river-bed between me and them so thatI am unable to get to their mosque and lead them in the prayer. Messengerof Allah, I would very much like you to come and pray in my house so thatI could take it as a prayer-place." He said, "I will do that, Allah willing."'Itban said, "The following day when the sun was well up, the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr came and theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked for permission toenter and I gave him permission. He did not sit down when he entered thehouse but said, "Where in your house would you like me to pray?" I pointedout to him the place where I wanted to pray. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, stood and said the <I>takbir</I>, and we formedrows behind him. He prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> and then said the taslim .We persuaded him to stay for some <I>khazira</I> [meat soup with bran] wehad been prepared. Quite a number of the men of those houses gathered inthe house and one of them said, "Where is Malik ibn ad-Dukhshun?" "That manis a hypocrite who does not love Allah and His Messenger." The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not say that. Do you not seethat he has said, 'There is no god but Allah,' desiring by that nothing butthe face of Allah?" The man said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." Headded, "But we have only seen him directing himself to the hypocrites andadvising them." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"Allah has forbidden the Fire for anyone who says 'There is no god but Allah'desiring by that the face of Allah."'"<P>Ibn Shihab said, "Then I asked al-Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Ansari, one of theBanu Salim, who was one of their nobles, about the<I> hadith</I> of Mahmudand he confirmed it."<P><P><B>XV. Dried curd (<I>aqit</I>)</B><P>Humayd said, "I heard Anas say, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, consummated his marriage with Safiyya, he put out dates,dried curd and ghee."<P>'Amr ibn Abi 'Amr said that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, prepared <I>hays</I>."<P>5087. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "My aunt gave the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, a lizard, dried curd and milk. The lizardwas placed on his table. If it had been unlawful it would not have been placedthere. He drank the milk and ate the dried curd."<P><P><B>XVI. Garden-beet and barley</B><P>5088. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "We used to be happy on theday of Jumu'a. There was an old woman among us who used to pull up by theroots the garden-beet (<I>silq</I>) and put them in a pot. Then she wouldput in some barley. When we had prayed, we would visit her and then she wouldbring it to us. We used to be happy on the day of Jumu'a because of that.We did not have lunch or an afternoon nap except after Jumu'a. By Allah,there was no fat or melted fat in it."<P><P><B>XVII. Biting and tearing meat with the teeth</B><P>5089.

Eating meat from the bone with the teeth</B><P>5090. It is related that Abu Qatada said, "We went out with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the direction of Makka..."<P>5091. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Qatada as-Salami that his fathersaid, "One day I was sitting with some men of the Companions of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in a stage on the Makka road. TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had alightedahead of us. The people were in ihram but I was not. They saw a wild asswhile I was busy fixing my sandal throng. They did not inform me about it,but they wanted for me to see it. I turned and saw it and went to my horseand saddled it. Then I mounted, forgetting my whip and spear. I said to them,'Hand me my whip and spear.' They said, 'No, by Allah, we will not help youin it at all.' I became angry and got off and took them and then I mountedand attacked the ass and stabbed it. Then I brought it when it was dead.They began to eat it and then they were unsure about eating it as they werein <I>ihram</I>. We travelled and I concealed its foreleg with me. We caughtup to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andasked him about that. He said, 'Do you have any of it with you?' I said,'Yes.' I gave him the foreleg and he ate it until he had cleaned it whilehe was in <I>ihram</I>."<P>The like of it is related by 'Ata' ibn Yasar from Abu Qatada.<P><P><B>XIX. Cutting meat with a knife</B><P>5092. It is related from Ja'far ibn 'Amr ibn Umayya that his father, 'Amribn Umayya, informed him that he saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, cutting off a piece of a shoulder of mutton whenhe was called to the prayer. He put down the knife and prayed without doingwudu'.<P><P><B>XX. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not criticisefood</B><P>5093. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, never criticised food. If he liked it, heate it, and if he disliked it, he left it."<P><P><B>XXI. Blowing on barley</B><P>5094 It is related that Abu Hazim said that he asked Sahl, "Did you see anywhite flour in the time of the Prophet?" "No," he answered. I asked, "Didyou sift barley?" 'No," he answered, "but we used to blow on it (to removethe husks)."<P><P><B>XXII. What the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and hiscompanions used to eat</B><P>5095. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "One day the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, divided some dates between his Companions.He gave each one seven dates. He gave me seven dates, one of which was adry date*. I loved it more than any of the other days because I had to chewit hard.<P>[*Hashafa: a type of date that dries without ripening and is considered tobe the worst sort of date.]<P>5096. It is related that Sa'd said, "I remember when I was one of (the first)seven with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. We had nofood except the leaves of the Hubla or the Habala* so that our stool waslike that of sheep. Now the Banu Asad want to teach me about Islam. I wouldbe lost then and my striving wasted."<P>[*Hubla is the fruit of the 'Idah, a sort of thorny tree which is a sortof bean, and habala is the stock of a grape vine.]<P>5097. It is related that Abu Hazim said, "I asked Sahl ibn Sa'd, 'Did theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, eat any whiteflour?' Sahl said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, never saw any white flour from the time when Allah sent him untilAllah took him.' I asked, 'Did you have sieves in the time of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' He answered, 'The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, never saw a sieve fromthe time when Allah sent him until Allah took him.' I asked, 'How could youeat unsifted barley?' He said, 'We used to grind it and blow on it and afterthe husk blew away, we moistened what was left and then ate it.'"<P>5098. It is reported that Abu Hurayra passed by a group of people in frontof whom was a roasted sheep. They invited him, but he refused to eat andsaid, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,leftthis world without ever having his fill of barley."<P>5099. It is related from Qatada that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, never ate at a table or from a saucernor did he eat thin bread." Yunus said, "I asked Qatada, 'What did they eaton?' 'On mats.' he replied."<P>5100. It is reported that 'A'isha said, "The family of Muhammad, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, never had their fill of wheat to eat for threedays in a row from the time he arrived in Madina until he died."<P><P><B>XXIII. <I>Talbina</I> (a dish prepared from milk and flour or bran, sometimeswith honey added)</B><P>5101. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, that when one of her relatives died, the women gatheredfor that and then dispersed except for her family and close friends. Shewould order a pot of <I>talbina</I> to be cooked. Then tharid (meat broth)*was prepared and the talbina poured on it. Then she said, "Eat from it. Iheard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say,'<I>Talbina</I> relieves the heart of the sick person and removes some ofhis sorrow.'"<P>[Crumbled bread which is then moistened with broth)<P><P><B>XXIV. Tharid (broth)</B><P>5102. It is related from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "There are many perfect men, but theonly perfect women were Maryam bint 'Imran and Asiyya, the wife of Pharaoh.The excellence of 'A'isha over other women is like the excellence of tharidover other types of food."<P>5103. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "The excellence of 'A'isha over other women is like theexcellence of tharid over other types of food."<P>5104. It is related that Anas said, "I went with the Prophet to a slave ofhis who was a tailor. He brought him a dish of tharid and went back to hiswork. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to followthe pieces of pumpkin and I began to follow it and put it before him." Hesaid, "I have loved pumpkin ever since."<P><P><B>XXV. A roasted sheep, and shoulder and shank</B><P>5105. It is related that Qatada said, "We used to go to Anas ibn Malik whilehis baker was standing. He said, 'Eat. I do not know that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, ever saw thin bread until he met Allahand he never saw a whole roasted sheep with his own eyes."<P>5106. It is related that 'Amr ibn Umayya ad-Damri said, "I saw Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cutting meat from theshoulder of a sheep and eating it. Then he was called to the prayer and herose and put down the knife and prayed without renewing wudu'."<P><P><B>XXVI. Food, meat and other thing which the Salaf used to store in theirhouses and take on their journeys</B><P>'A'isha and Asma' said, "We prepared provision for the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr."<P>5107.
