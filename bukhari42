Book of Asking Permission to Enter</B></BIG><P><P><B>I. Initiating the Greeting</B><P>5873. Hammam related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Allah created Adam on His form and his heightwas sixty cubits. When He created him, He said, 'Go and greet that groupangels and listen to how they greet you. It will be your greeting and thegreeting of your descendants.' He said, 'Peace be upon you,' and they said,'Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah,' and they added, 'and the mercyof Allah.' Everyone who enters the Garden will be in form of Adam. Peoplehave been getting shorter until now."<P><P><B>II. Chapter.</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"O you who believe! Do not enter houses otherthan your own until you have asked permission and greeted their inhabitants.That is better for you &#150; so that perhaps you may pay heed. And if youfind no one at home do not go in until permission has been granted you. Andif you are told to go away then go away. That is far purer for you. Allahknows what you do. There is nothing wrong in your entering houses where noone lives where there is some service for you. Allah knows what you divulgeand what you conceal."</I> (24:27-29)<P>Sa'id ibn Abi'l-Hasan said to al-Hasan, "Non-Arab women show their chestsand heads." He said, "Avert your gaze from them. Allah Almighty says,<I>'Say to the believing men that they should lower their eyes and guard theirprivate parts.' </I>(24:30) Qatada said, 'They guard them from what is notlawful for them. <I>"Say to the believing women that they should lower theireyes and guard their private parts.</I>" (24:31)'"<P><I>"The dishonesty of eyes" </I>(40:19) refers to looking at what is forbidden.<P>Az-Zuhri said about looking at girls who have not yet menstruated, "It isnot proper to look at any of them whom one might desire to look at it, evenif she is little."<P>'Ata' disliked looking at slavegirls who were being sold in Makka unlesshe wanted to make a purchase.<P>5874. Sulayman ibn Yasar reported that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had al-Fadl ibn 'Abbasride behind him on the Day of Sacrifice on the back of his camel. Al-Fadlwas a handsome man. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,stopped to give verdicts to the people. A woman of Khath'am with a beautifulface came up to ask the Messenger of Allah for a verdict. Al-Fadl began tolook at her and admired her beauty. The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, turned around and al-Fadl was looking at her. He put hishand behind him and took the chin of al-Fadl and turned his face away fromlooking at her. She said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allah has made going on hajjobligatory for His slaves and my father is a very old man and cannot remainfirm in his seat when riding. Can I go on hajj for him?' He said, 'Yes.'<P>5875. Sulayman ibn Yasar related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Beware of sitting in theroadways." They said, "Messenger of Allah. we must have places where we cansit and talk together." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "If you must sit there, then give the roadway its rights."They asked, "What are the rights of the roadway, Messenger of Allah?" Hesaid, "Lowering the eye, refraining from causing annoyance, returning thegreeting, commanding the right and forbidding the wrong."<P><P><B>III. <I>As-Salam</I> (Peace) is one of the Names of Allah Almighty</B><P><I>"When you are greeted with a greeting, greet with one better than it orreturn it."</I> (4:86)<P>5876. It is reported from Shaqiq that 'Abdullah said, "When we prayed behindthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we said, 'Peace beupon Allah from His slaves. Peace be upon Jibril. Peace be upon Mika'il.Peace be upon so-and-so and so-and-so.' When the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, finished, he, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, turned to us and said, 'Allah is Peace. When one of you sits in theprayer, he should say, "Greetings belong to Allah and prayers and good words.Peace be upon you, O Prophet and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peacebe upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah." If you say that, it willcover every right-acting slave of Allah in the heavens and the earth. "Itestify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is Hisslave and Messenger." After that he can choose to say whatever he wishes.'"<P><P><B>IV. A small group greet the larger group</B><P>5877. Hammam ibn Munabbih related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The young greets the old, theone walking the one who is sitting, and the small group greets the largergroup."<P><P><B>V. The rider greets the one who is walking</B><P>5878. Thabit, the client of 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Zayd, said that he heard AbuHurayra say that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "The rider greets the one walking, the one walking greets theone sitting, and the small group greet the larger group."<P><P><B>VI. The one walking greets the one sitting</B><P>5879. Thabit, the client of 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Zayd, reported from Abu Hurayrathat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"The rider greets the one walking, the one walking greets the one sittingand the small group greets the larger."<P><P><B>VII. The young greets the older</B><P>5880. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The young greets the oldand the one walking greets the one sitting, and a small group greet a largegroup."<P><P><B>VIII. Making the greeting common practice</B><P>5881. Mu'awiya ibn Suwayd ibn Muqarrin related that he heard al-Bara' ibn'Azib say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commandedus to do seven things and forbade us seven things. He commanded us to visitthe sick, join funeral processions, bless the sneezer, assist the weak, helpthe wronged, make the greeting common practice, and fulfil oaths. He forbadeus to drink from silver vessels, and he forbade us to wear gold rings, rideon silk saddle cloths, and to wear silk, silk brocade, <I>qissi</I> silkand <I>istabraq</I> silk."<P><P><B>IX. Greeting those one knows and those one does not know</B><P>5882. Abu'l-Khayr related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr that a man asked the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Which part of Islam is best?' Heanswered, "That you feed people and greet those whom you know and those whomyou do not know."<P>5883. 'Ata' ibn Yazid al-Laythi related from Abu Ayyub, may Allah be pleasedwith him, related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than threedays so that they meet and this one turns this way and that one turns thatway. The best of them is the one who initiates the greeting." Sufyan mentionedthat he heard it from him three times.<P><P><B>X. The Ayat of the Hijab</B><P>5884. Ibn Shihab reported from Anas ibn Malik that he was ten years old whenthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came toMadina. [He said,] "I served the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, for ten years of his wife. I am the one who knows bestabout the business of the screen and when it was revealed. Ubayy ibn Ka'bused to ask me about it. The first of what was revealed was on the weddingnight of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,with Zaynab bint Jahsh. In the morning, the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was a groom and he invited people who had some foodand then went out. A group of them remained with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for a long time. The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and went out and Iwent out with him so that they would go out. The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, walked and so did I, and he went tothe threshold of 'A'isha's room. Thinking that they had left, the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went back and I went withhim. He entered where Zaynab was and they were still sitting there and hadnot left. So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went backand I went with him as far as the threshold of 'A'isha's room. Thinking thatthey had left, he went back and I went with him, and they had left. The Ayatthe Screen (Hijab) was revealed and he let down a curtain between me andhim."<P>5885. Abu Miljaz related that Anas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, married Zaynab, some people came in and were fed.Then they sat down conversing. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, seemed ready to get up, but they did not get up. When hesaw that, he actually got up, and when he did so, some people got up to gowhile some people remained sitting. The Prophet , may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, came back to enter and found the people still sitting there.Then they finally got up. So I went and told the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, that they had gone. He went inside. I went to enter,but he put up a screen between me and him, and then Allah revealed,<I> 'Oyou who believe! Do not go into the Prophet's rooms...</I>' (33:53)"<P>Abu 'Abdullah said, "It contains some <I>fiqh</I>. He did not ask permissionfrom them when he stood up and went out. Also he made ready to go, meaningfor them to depart."<P>5886. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab usedto say to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,'Veil your wives,"' but the he did not do it. The wives of the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,used to go out at night to al-Manasi' at night (to defecate). Once Sawdabint Zam'a, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,went out. She was a tall woman and 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, who was in a gathering,saw her and said, 'We have recognised you, Sawda!' because of his keennessfor the Veil to be veiled. So Allah Almighty revealed the Ayat of the Screen."<P><P><B>XI. Asking permission to enter is for looking</B><P>5887. Az-Zuhri said, "I preserved it as you are here from Sahl ibn Sa'd whosaid. "A man looked into one of the rooms of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was scratching his head with an iron comb. He said, 'If I hadknown that you were looking, I would have poked this in your eye. Askingpermission to enter was instituted on account of the eyes."<P>5888. 'Ubaydullah ibn Abi Malik related from Anas ibn Malik that a man lookedinto one of the rooms of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to him withan arrowhead (or arrowheads). It is as if I were looking at him trying tojab the man."<P><P><B>XII. The fornication of the limbs which falls short of the private parts</B><P>5889. Tawus related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I did not see anything more likeminor sins than the words of Abu Hurayra...<P>Tawus related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I did not see anything more like minorsins than what Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "Allah has written for the son of Adam a share offornication which he must commit. The fornication of the eyes is the lookand the fornication of the tongue is the speech. The self wishes and desiresand the private parts confirm all of this or deny it."<P><P><B>XIII. Greeting and asking permission three times</B><P>5890. Thumama ibn 'Abdullah related from Anas that when the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to greet, he greetedthree times. When he said something, he repeated it three times.<P>5891. Busr ibn Sa'id related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "I was in onethe gatherings of the Ansar when Abu Musa came as if he was frightened, Hesaid, 'I asked permission to visit 'Umar three times and he did not giveme permission, so I returned. Then he said, 'What kept you from entering?'I said, 'I asked permission to enter three times and was not given permission,so I went back. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'When one of you asks for permission to enter three times andis not given it, he should go back.' He said, 'By Allah, you will producea clear proof of it.' Is there any of you who heard it from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' Ubayy ibn Ka'b said, 'By Allah,only the youngest of the people will go with you.' I was the youngest ofthe people and I went with him and informed 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, had said that.<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Abu Sa'id.<P><P><B>XIV. If a man is invited and then comes, should he ask permission?</B><P>Abu Rafi' reported from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "It is his permission."<P>5892. Mujahid related that Abu Hurayra said, "I went in with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he found some milkin a drinking bowl. He said, 'Abu Hirr. Go to the People of the Suffa andinvite them to come to me.' I went to them and invited them. They came andasked permission to enter and he gave them permission and they entered."<P><P><B>XV. Greeting Children</B><P>5893. Thabit al-Bunani related from Anas ibn Malik that he passed by somechildren and greeted them and said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, used to do that."<P><P><B>XVI. Men greeting women and women greeting men</B><P>5894. Abu Hazim related: "Sahl said, 'We used to be happy on the day of Jumu'a.''Why?' I asked. He said, 'There was an old woman among us who used to sendsomeone to Buda'a (Ibn Maslama said that it was some palm trees in Madina)and she would pull up the roots the garden-beet (<I>silq</I>) and put themin a pot. Then she would put in some ground barley. When we had prayed Jumu'a,we would go and greet her and then she would bring it to us. We used to behappy of that. We did not have lunch or an afternoon nap except after Jumu'a.'"<P>5895. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman reported that 'A'isha said "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ''A'isha, this isJibril who gives you the greeting.' I said, 'And on him peace and the mercyof Allah. You see what we do not see.'" She meant the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>Shu'ayb corroborated it. Yunus and an-Nu'man related from az-Zuhri, "Andhis blessings."<P><P><B>XVII. When someone says, "Who is it" and the other says, "I"</B><P>5896. Muhammad ibn al-Munkafir said, "I heard Jabir say, 'I went to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about a debt which my father owed,I knocked on the door and he said, 'Who is it?' I said, 'I.' He said, 'I?I?' as if he disliked it."<P><P><B>XVIII. The one who returned the greeting by saying, 'And on you peace."</B><P>'A'isha said, "And on him peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings."<P>The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The angels respondedto Adam, 'Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah."<P>5897. Sa'id ibn Abi Sa'id al-Maqburi related that Abu Hurayra said, "A manentered the mosque while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, was in a corner of the mosque. He prayed and then came andgreeted him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said to him, 'And upon you be peace. Go and back and pray. You have not prayed.'He prayed and then came and greeted and the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'And upon you be peace. Go and back and pray.You have not prayed.' The second time or the time after that he said, 'Teachme, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'When you stand for the prayer, go <I>wudu'</I>properly, then face the <I>qibla</I> and say the <I>takbir</I>. Thenrecite what is easy for you that you know of the Qur'an and then do <I>ruku'</I>until you are at rest in your <I>ruku'</I>. Then stand back up untilyou are completely upright. Then go into <I>sajda</I> until you are at restin your <I>sajda</I>. Then sit back until you are at rest in the sittingposition. Then go into <I>sajda</I> until you are at rest in your<I>sajda</I>. Then sit back until you are at rest in the sitting position.Do that throughout all of your prayer.'" Abu Usama said in the end, "Untilyou are completely upright.'"<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Abu Hurayra in which he said that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Then you come up until youare at rest in the sitting position."<P><P><B>XIX. When someone says, 'So-and-so sends you the greeting"</B><P>5898. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman reported that 'A'isha reported to himthat the Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidto her, "Jibril gives you the greeting."' She said, "And on him peace andthe mercy of Allah."<P><P><B>XX. Greeting in a gathering which is a mixture of Muslims and idolaters</B><P>5899. It is related from 'Urwa that Usama ibn Zayd told him that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rode a donkey with saddleunderneath which was a cloth made in Fadak and Usama ibn Zayd was ridingbehind him. He went to visit Sa'd ibn 'Ubada in the Banu'l-Harith ibn al-Khazrajbefore the Battle of Badr. He proceeded until he passed by a gathering whichcontained a mixture of Muslims, idolaters, pagans, and Jews. Among them was'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul. 'Abdullah ibn Rawaha was in the gathering.When the dust from the donkey reached the gathering, 'Abdullah ibn Ubayycovered his nose with his cloak and then said, "Don't cover us with dust!"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, greeted them and thenstopped, He dismounted and invited them to Allah and recited the Qur'an tothem. 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul said, "O man! There is nothing betterthan what you say if it is the truth. So do not annoy us with it in ourgatherings. Return to your mount and recount to whoever of us comes to you."'Abdullah ibn Rawaha said, "Bring it to us in our gatherings. We like that!"So the Muslims, idolaters and Jews abused one another until they were practicallyfighting. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, kept on calmingthem down [until they were quiet]. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, mounted his animal and went until he visited Sa'd ibn'Ubada. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him,"Sa'd, did you not hear what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy) said?He said such-and-such." Sa'd said, "O Messenger of Allah, pardon him andoverlook it. Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of thislittle town had agreed to crown him and bind his head with a (royal) turban.When Allah refused that by the truth which Allah gave you, he was vexed onthat account. That is why he did what you saw." The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, pardoned him.<P><P><B>XXI. The one who did not greet someone who had committed a wrong actionand the one who did not return the greeting until his repentance was clear.How long one should wait for the repentance of the rebel to become clear</B><P>'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "Do not greet those who drink wine."<P>5900. 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b said, "I heard Ka'b ibn Ka'b relate about when hestayed behind the Tabuk expedition and the Messenger of Allah forbade peopleto speak to us. I would come to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and greet him and ask myself, 'Did his lips move toreturn the greeting or not?' This went on for fifty nights and then the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, announced that Allah had turnedto us when he had prayed Fajr."<P><P><B>XXII. How to respond to the greeting of the people of <I>dhimma</I></B><P>5901. 'Urwa reported that 'A'isha said, "A group of Jews visited the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, <I>'as-Samu'alaykum' </I>(death be upon you. I understood it and said, 'And upon yoube death and the curse!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'Gently, 'A'isha. Allah loves kindness in all things.'I said, 'Messenger of Allah, did you not hear what they said?' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'And I said, "Andupon you."'"<P>5902. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the Jews greetyou, one of them will say, 'Death be upon you,' so say, 'And on you.'"<P>5903. 'Ubaydullah ibn Abi Bakr ibn Anas related from Anas ibn Malik thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the Peopleof the Book greet you, then say, 'And on you.'"<P><P><B>XXIII. The one who looked at a letter of someone suspected in respectof the Muslims in order to make his business clear</B><P>5904. Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman as-Sulami related that 'Ali said, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent me, az-Zubayr ibnal-'Awwam, and Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi on horseback, saying, 'Go until youreach the meadow Khakh. There will be a woman of the idolworshippers whowill have a letter of Hatib ibn Abi Balta'a to the idolworshippers.' We caughther riding her camel where the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, had told us. We said, ''Where is the letter you have!' Shesaid, 'I have no letter.' So we made her camel kneel and searched her mountwithout finding anything. My companions said, 'We do not see any letter.'I said, 'You know that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, does not lie. I swear by Allah that you will bring out the letteror we will strip you.' When she saw we were serious, she put her hand belowher waist-belt which belted her garment and produced the letter. We tookit to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Hesaid, 'What moved you to do what you did?' Hatim said, 'By Allah, I onlybelieve in Allah and His Messenger! I have not altered or changed. But Iwanted to have some favour with the people through which Allah might protectmy relatives and property. There are none of your Companions who do not haverelatives by whom Allah will protect their family and property.' He said,'He has told the truth. Do not say anything but good about him.' 'Umar ibnal-Khattab said, 'He has betrayed Allah, His Messenger and the believers.Let me strike off his head! he said, ''Umar, what will let you know. PerhapsAllah looked down on the people of Badr and said, "Do what you like. I haveforgiven you. The Garden is mandatory for you.' So 'Umar wept and said, 'Allahand His Messenger know best.'"<P><P><B>XXIV. How a letter is written to the People of the Book</B><P>5905. Ibn 'Abbas reported that Abu Sufyan ibn Harb told him that Heracliussent for him along with a group of Quraysh who were trading in Syria. Sothey went to him. He mentioned the account and said, "Then he called forthe letter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and it was read out. It said: 'In the Name of Allah, the All-Merciful, MostMerciful. From Muhammad, the slave of Allah and His Messenger, to Heraclius,the Chief of Byzantium, Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. Followingon from that...'"<P><P><B>XXV. Whose name is put first in a letter?</B><P>5906. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Hurmuz related from Abu Hurayra that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned a man of thetribe of Israel who took a piece of book, made a hole in it and put a thousanddinars in it and a letter from him, to his friend.<P>Abu Salama related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "He carved a piece of wood and put the moneyinside of it and wrote a page to him, from so-and-so to so-and-so.'"<P><P><B>XXVI. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"Rise for your master"</B><P>5907. Abu Umama ibn Sahl ibn Hunayf related from Abu Sa'id that the peopleof Qurayza agreed upon the judgement of Sa'd. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, sent for him and he said, and he said, "Rise foryour master," or "the best of you". He sat with the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, who said, "These people have agreed to take yourjudgement." He said, "I judge that their fighters be killed and their womenand children taken as captives." He said, "You have given the judgement whichthe King has judged."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said, "One of my companions related from Abu'l-Walid from theword of Sa'id, "For your judgement."<P><P><B>XXVII. Shaking with both hands</B><P>Ibn Mas'ud said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, taughtme the <I>tashahhud</I> while my hand was between his palms."<P>Ka'b ibn Malik said, "I entered the mosque and there was the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Talha ibn 'Ubaydullah rushedto me and shook my hand and congratulated me."<P>5908. Qatada said, "I said to Anas, 'Did the Companions of the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, shake hands?' 'Yes,' He answered."<P>5909. 'Abdullah ibn Hisham said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, while he was holding the hand of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab."<P><P><B>XXVIII. Taking hold of the hands</B><P>Hammad ibn Zayd shook hands with Ibn al-Mubarak.<P>5910. Abu Ma'mar 'Abdullah ibn Sakhbara related that he heard Ibn Mas'udsay, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, taughtme the <I>tashahhud</I> while my hand was between his palms just as he taughtme a sura of the Qur'an: 'Greetings belong to Allah, and prayers and goodwords. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.Peace be upon us and upon the right-acting slaves of Allah. I testify thatthere is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and HisMessenger.' We did this while he was among us and when he died, we said thesalam, i.e. 'Peace be upon the Prophet*.'"<P><P><B>XXIX. Embracing, and the words of a man, "How are you this morning?"</B><P>5911. 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b related that Ibn 'Abbas told him that 'Ali ibn AbiTalib came out from being with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace ...<P>'Abdullah ibn Ka'b related that Ibn 'Abbas told him that 'Ali ibn Abi Talibcame out from being with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,when he was suffering from the illness from which he died. People asked,"O Abu'l-Hasan! How is the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, this morning?" He said, "Praise be to Allah, he is well this morning."'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib took him by the hand and said to him, "By Allah,in three days time you will be a subject. By Allah, I think that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, will die of this illnessof him. I recognise the faces of the Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib when they aredying. Let us go to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and ask him who will have this authority. If it is in us, thenwe will know that, and if it is for other than us, we will know it and hecan advise him to look after us." 'Ali said, "By Allah, if we asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for it and he refusedus, then the people would never give it to us afterwards. By Allah, I willnot ask it from the Messenger of Allah."<P><P><B>XXX. The one who answered with, "At your service"</B><P>5912. Anas related that Mu'adh said, "I was riding behind the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'Mu'adh!' 'At your serviceand obedience, Messenger of Allah,' I answered. Then he said that a thirdtime and said, 'Do you know what is Allah's right on His slaves?' 'No,' Ianswered. He said, 'Allah's right on His slaves is that they should worshipHim and not associate anything with Him.' Then he travelled for a time andthen said, 'Mu'adh!' 'At your service and obedience, Messenger of Allah,'I answered. He said, 'Do you know what is the right of the slaves on Allahif they do that? That He does not punish them.'"<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Anas from Mu'adh.<P>5913. Zayd ibn Wahb related that Abu Dharr had related to him at ar-Rabadha,"I was walking with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,in the Harra of Madina in the evening and Uhud was in front of us. He said,'Abu Dharr, I would not like to have the amount of Uhud in gold then haveany of it remain with me for more than one or three days except a dinar Imight keep for paying debts. I would say that it is for the servants of Allah:so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so.' He showed us with his hand and thensaid, 'Abu Dharr.' 'At your service and obedience, Messenger of Allah,' Ianswered. He said, 'Those who have a lot (in this world) will have little(reward in the Next) except for someone who spends his money here and there.'Then he told me, 'Stay where you are, Abu Dharr, and do not leave until Icome back.' He went until he disappeared from my sight. I heard a voice andfeared that something might happen to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. I wanted to go and then I remembered what the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said: 'Do not go.'I stayed and then I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I heard a voice and I fearedthat something had happened to you. Then I remembered what you had said andso I stayed.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'That was Jibril. He came to me and told me that any of my community whodie without associating anything with Allah will enter the Garden.' I said,'Messenger of Allah, even if he fornicates and even if he steals?' He said,"Even if he fornicates and even if he steals.'"<P>[Al-A'mash] I said to Zayd, "It has reached me that it was Abu'd-Darda'.'He replied, 'I testify that Abu Dharr related it to me at ar-Rabadha.'"<P>Al-A'mash said, "Abu Salih related the like of it from Abi'd-Darda'."

Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, forbade that a man be made to get up from his seat sothat another can sit in his place, but they should make room and spread out.Ibn 'Umar used to dislike for a man to be made to get up from the seat sothat then someone else sits in his place.<P><P><B>XXXIII.

They ate and then remained sitting in conversation. Thenthe Prophet seemed ready to get up, but they did not get up. When he sawthat, he actually got up, and when he did so, everyone got up except forthree individuals. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,came back to enter and found the people still sitting there. Then they finallygot up and left. So I went and told the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, that they had gone. He went inside. I went to enter, buthe put up a screen between me and him, and then Allah revealed, <I>'O youwho believe! Do not go into the Prophet's rooms except when you are invitedto come and eat </I>... to ... <I>To do that would be dreadful in Allah'ssight.' </I>(33:53)"<P><P><B>XXXIV.

I offeredhim a leather cushion stuffed with palm fibre, but he sat on the ground.The cushion remained between me and him. He said, "Are not three days everymonth enough for you?" I said, "Messenger of Allah!" He said, "Five?" I said,"Messenger of Allah!" He said, "Seven?" I said, "Messenger of Allah!" Hesaid, "Nine?" I said, "Messenger of Allah!" He said, "Eleven?" Then the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no fast superiorto the fast of Da'ud, peace be upon him: half the year. Fast one day andbreak the fast the next."'"<P>5922.

He said, 'Is there not among you the confidant (of the Prophet)with his secrets whom no one but he knows? i.e. Hudhayfa. Is there not amongyou the one whom Allah protected from Shaytan, i.e. on the tongue of HisProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,? i.e. 'Ammar. Is therenot among you or in you the keeper of the siwak and cushion?' i.e. Ibn Mas'ud.How did 'Abdullah recite, <I>'"By the night when it conceals.." </I>(92:1)'He said, "by the male and female."

He said, 'Where is your cousin?'She said, 'We had a difference of opinion and he got angry with me and wentout. He did not take his mid-day nap here with me.' The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to someone, 'See where he is.'He came back and said, 'Messenger of Allah, he is sleeping in the mosque.'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went andfound 'Ali lying there. His cloak had fallen from on top of him and had becomecovered with dust. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, began to dust it off, saying, 'Get up, Abu Turab (Dusty one)!Get up, Abu Turab!'"<P><P><B>XLI.

He said, "When Anas ibn Malik wasdying, he told me to put some of that <I>sukk</I> in his hanut (the mixedscent used for the corpse), and that was done."<P>5926. Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha reported that he heard Anas ibn Maliksay, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,went to Quba', he used to visit Umm Haram bint Milhan and she would feedhim.

The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, went to sleep and then woke up smiling. Shesaid, 'I said, "What made you smile, Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Somepeople from my community who were shown me raiding in the way of Allah, ridingthe middle of this sea like kings on throne" (or like the kings on the thrones- Ishaq was unsure)."' She said, 'I said, "Messenger of Allah, ask Allahto put me among them!"' So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, made supplication for her. 'Then he put his head down andwent to sleep and then woke up smiling. I said, "What made you smile, Messengerof Allah?" He said, "Some people from my community who were shown me raidingin the way of Allah," as he said the first time.' She said, 'I said, "Messengerof Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!"

ByAllah, her gait was much like that of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. When he saw her, he welcomed her and said, 'Welcome,my daughter!' and then he had her sit to his right or to his left and thenshe confided something to her and she wept profusely. When he saw her sorrow,he confided something else to her and she laughed. I was the only one ofhis wives who said to her, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, singled you out for a secret from among us and then youwept." When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,got up and left, I asked her, 'What did he confide to you?' She said, 'Iwill not divulge the secret of the Messenger of Allah.' When he died, I saidto her, 'I insist? on you by what right I have on you to tell me.; She said,'Now I will do it.' She told me and said, 'As for what he confided to methe first time, he told him that Jibril used to present the Qur'an to himonce a year. He said, "This year, he has presented it to me twice. I onlythink that my time is approaching. Fear Allah and be steadfast. I am an excellentpredecessor for you."' She said, 'Then I wept as you say. When he saw mydistress, he confided to me a second time and said, "Fatima, are you notpleased that you will be the mistress of the believing women or the mistressof the women of this community?'"<P><P><B>XLIV. Lying one's Back</B><P>5929. 'Abbad ibn Tamim related that his uncle said, "I saw the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, lying on his back in the mosque withone of his feet over the other."<P><P><B>XLV. Two should not converse privately to the exclusion of a third</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"O you who believe! When you confer togethersecretly, do not do so in wrongdoing and enmity and disobedience to theMessenger, rather confer together in goodness and fear of Allah. Show fearof Allah &#150; Him to Whom you will be gathered. Conferring in secret isfrom Shaytan to cause grief to those who believe. But it does not harm themat all unless by Allah's permission. So let the believers trust in Allah."</I>(58:9-10)<P>He says, "<I>O you who believe! When you consult the Messenger privatelyprecede your private consultation by giving sadaqa &#150; hat is better foryou and purer. But if you cannot find the means, Allah is Ever-Forgiving,Most Merciful. Are you afraid to give gifts of sadaqa before your privateconsultation! If you do not and Allah turns to you, at least establish theprayer and pay zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is aware ofwhat you do." </I>(58:12-13)<P>5930.

Umm Sulaym asked me, but I did not tell her."<P><P><B>XLVII. When there are more than three people, then there is nothing wrongin private and secret conversation</B><P>5932. Abu Wa'il related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "If there are three of you, then two of youshould not converse privately to the exclusion of a third until you are mixedwith more people since that might cause him grief."<P>5933. Shaqiq related that 'Abdullah said, "One day the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, made a distribution and a man from the Ansarsaid, 'This is a division by which the Face of Allah is not desired.' I said,'By Allah, I will go to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!'I went to him while he was in a gathering and confided to him and he becameangry so that his face became red. Then he said, 'May Allah have mercy onMusa. He was injured by worse than this and was steadfast.'"<P><P><B>XLVIII. A lengthy private conversation</B><P>In His words, <I>"when they confer together secretly" </I>(17:47),<I>najw&acirc;</I> is the verbal noun from <I>n&acirc;j&acirc;</I> (FormIII).

The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, spoke about them and said, 'This fire is your enemy.When you go to sleep put it out.'"<P>5937. 'Ata' related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Cover vessels, close doors,and put out fires.

Abu Ishaq related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "Ibn 'Abbas was asked,'How old were you when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,died?'
