<P>
<P>
<B>I: The obligation of Hajj and its excellence</B>
<P>
<I>"Hajj to the House is a duty owed to Allah by all mankind &#150; those
who can find a way to do it. But if anyone rejects, Allah is Rich beyond
need of any being."</I> (3:97)
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#98">1442</A>. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas
said, "Al-Fadl was riding behind the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, when a woman of Khath'am came up. Al-Fadl began
to look at her and she to look at him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, turned al-Fadl's face to look the other way. She said,
'Messenger of Allah, Allah has made going on hajj obligatory for His slaves
and my father is a very old man and cannot remain firm in his seat when riding.
Can I go on hajj for him?' He said, 'Yes.' That was during the Farewell Hajj."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"They will come to you on foot and
on all sorts of lean animals, coming by every distant road so that they can
be present at what will profit them."</I></B>
<P>
<I>Fijaj</I> (71:20) are wide paths.
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#29">1443.</A> It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "I saw
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, getting
onto his mount at Dhu'l-Hulayfa. He said "<I>Labbayk</I>" when it had stood
up completely."
<P>
1444. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said "<I>Labbayk</I>" starting at
Dhu'l-Hulayfa after his mount had stood up completely."
<P>
Anas and Ibn 'Abbas related it.
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Going on hajj sitting on a pack-saddle</B>
<P>
It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, sent her brother, 'Abdu'r-Rahman, with her and he took her on
<I>'umra </I>from at-Tan'im and mounted her on a pack-saddle. 'Umar said,
"Tie on your pack-saddles for the hajj. It is one of the two types of
<I>jihad</I>."
<P>
1445. It is related that Anas said, "Anas, who was not a miser, went on hajj
sitting on a pack-saddle. He related that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had gone on hajj sitting on a pack-saddle,
with his baggage alongside him."
<P>
1446. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Messenger of Allah, you performed
<I>'umra </I>but I did not." He said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman, go with your sister
and take her to perform<I> 'umra</I>, starting from at-Tan'im." He put her
behind on a camel and she performed <I>'umra.</I>
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The excellence of an accepted hajj</B>
<P>
1447. Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was asked, "What action is the best?" He replied, "Belief
in Allah and His Messenger." He was asked, "Then what?" and replied, "Jihad
in the way of Allah." He was asked, "And then what?" He replied, "An accepted
hajj."
<P>
1448. It is related that 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin, said, "Messenger of Allah,
we see that jihad is the best action so should we not do jihad?" He said,
"No.the best jihad for you [feminine plural] is an accepted hajj."
<P>
1449. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Whoever goes on hajj for Allah alone
and does not have sexual intercourse or commit any outrage will return as
he was on the day his mother bore him.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The obligation of the miqats [places where people assume ihram for
the hajj] for the hajj and 'umra</B>
<P>
1450. It is related from Zayd ibn Jubayr that he went to visit 'Abdullah
ibn 'Umar in his house and he had tents made of hair-cloth and other large
tents there. [He said,] "I asked him from what place it was permitted to
do <I>'umra</I>. He said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, made it Qarn for the people of Najd, Dhu'l-Hulayfa for the
people of Madina, and al-Juhfa for the people of Syria.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"And take provision; but the best
provision is taqwa."</I> (2:197)</B>
<P>
1451. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The people of Yemen used to go
on hajj and not take provision. They would say, 'We are relying on Allah.'
When they came to Makka, they begged from people, so Allah Almighty sent
down down, &nbsp;<I>'And take provision; but the best provision is taqwa.</I>'"
<P>
It is related from 'Ikrima as a <I>mursal hadith</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The place where the people of Makka assume ihram for hajj and 'umra</B>
<P>
1452. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, appointed Dhu'l-Hulayfa as the <I>miqat</I> for the
people of Madina, al-Juhfa for the people of Syria, Qarn al-Manazil for the
people of Najd and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. They are for them and
for anyone, ariving at them from elsewhere, who wants to go on hajj or<I>
'umra</I>. The <I>miqat</I> for anyone coming from closer than that is the
place where he starts, even, in the case of the people of Makka, Makka itself."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The <I>miqat</I> of the people of Madina. They do not go into
<I>ihram</I> before Dhu'l-Hulayfa</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#22">1453</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar,
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The
people of Madina go into <I>ihram</I> from Dhu'l-Hulayfa, the people of Syria
from Juhfa, and the people of Najd from Qarn."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "They claim that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said that the people of Yemen go into <I>ihram</I>
from Yalamlam."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: The place where the people of Syria go into <I>ihram</I></B>
<P>
1454. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, appointed Dhu'l-Hulayfa as the <I>miqat</I> for the
people of Madina, al-Juhfa for the people of Syria, Qarn al-Manazil for the
people of Najd and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. They are for them and
for anyone ariving at them from elsewhere who wants to go on hajj o<I>r
'umra</I>. Anyone coming from closer than that should go into <I>ihram</I>
from his own house, the people of Makka even going into <I>ihram</I> from
there."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The place where the people of Najd go into <I>ihram</I></B>
<P>
1455. It is related from Salim's father [i.e. Ibn 'Umar] that the Prophet
appointed the <I>miqat</I>.
<P>
It is related from 'Abdullah [ibn 'Umar], "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "The place where the people
of Madina go into <I>ihram</I> is Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The place where the people
of Syria go into <I>ihram</I> is Mahya'a, which is al-Juhfa, and it is Qarn
for the people of Najd."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "They claim, although I did not hear it myself, that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The place where
the people of Yemen go into ihram is Yalamlam."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The place where those closer than the <I>miqats</I> go into
<I>ihram</I></B>
<P>
1456. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, appointed Dhu'l-Hulayfa as the <I>miqat</I> for the
people of Madina, al-Juhfa for the people of Syria, Yalamlam for the people
of Yemen, and Qarn al-Manazil for the people of Najd. They are for them and
for anyone ariving at them from elsewhere who wants to go on hajj or
<I>'umra</I>. The <I>miqat</I> for anyone coming from closer than that is
the place where he starts, even, in the case of the people of Makka, from
there."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: The place where the people of Yemen go into <I>ihram</I></B>
<P>
1457. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, appointed Dhu'l-Hulayfa as the <I>miqat</I> for the
people of Madina, al-Juhfa for the people of Syria, Qarn al-Manazil for the
people of Najd and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. They are for them and
for anyone ariving at them from elsewhere who wants to go on hajj or
<I>'umra</I>. The <I>miqat</I> for anyone coming from closer than that is
the place where he starts, even, in the case of the people of Makka, Makka
itself."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Dhat 'Irq is for the people of Iraq</B>
<P>
1458. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "When these two cities were conquered,
they came to 'Umar and said, 'Amir al-Mu'minin, the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, appointed Qarn for the people of Najd
[to go into <I>ihram</I>], but it is out of our way and to get to Qarn would
be difficult for us.' He said, 'See what is parallel to it on your route.'
So he appointed Dhat 'Irq for them."
<P>
[Chapter]
<P>
1459. It is related from 'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, halted his camel at al-Batha' in
Dhu'l-Hulayfa and prayed there. 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar used to do that.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, going out by
way of the tree</B>
<P>
1460. It is related from 'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to leave Madina by the tree
["ash-Shajara"] road and re-enter it by the al-Mu'arras road, and that when
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set out
for Makka, he would pray in the ash-Shajara mosque, and when he returned,
he would pray at Dhu'l-Hulayfa at the bottom of the valley and would stay
the night there until morning.
<P>
["The tree" is at the mosque of Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The Mu'arras road is closer
to Madina than the Tree (ash-Shajara) road. The ash-Shajara (tree) mosque
is at Dhu'l-Hulayfa.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: The words of the Prophet, "Al-'Aqiq is a blessed valley."</B>
<P>
1461. It is related that 'Umar was heard to say, "I heard the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say in the valley of 'Aqiq, 'Tonight
someone came to me from my Lord and said, "Pray in this blessed valley and
say that<I> 'umra </I>is included in hajj."'"
<P>
1462. It is related that 'Abdullah said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, had a vision while he was at Mu'arris in Dhu'l-Hulayfa
at the bottom of the valley. He was told, "You are on a blessed plain." Salim
made us halt our camels aiming for the place where 'Abdullah used to halt
his camel when seeking the place, at Mu'arris, where the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, halted, which is below the mosque
in the flat of the valley, midway between them and the road.
<P>
[Al-'Aqiq is near al-Baqi', about four miles from Madina. The meaning of
"<I>'aqiq"</I> is "gorge".]
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Washing khaluq perfume off the clothes three times</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#18">1463</A>. Safwan ibn Ya'la said, "Ya'la said to 'Umar,
'Show me the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he is
receiving revelation.' While the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, was at al-Ji'rana with some of his Companions, a man came to him and
said, 'Messenger of Allah, what do you think about a man who goes into
<I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>while covered with scent?' The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was silent for a time and then revelation
came upon him. 'Umar beckoned to Ya'la and Ya'la came over and there was
a cloth over the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
shading him. He peered under it and the face of the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was red and he was snoring. Then the
state left him and he asked, 'Where is the man who asked about <I>'umra</I>?'
A man was brought and he said, 'Wash off any perfume on you three times and
remove your cloak. Do the same for <I>'umra </I>as you do for hajj.'"
<P>
Ibn Jurayj said, "I asked 'Ata', "Did he mean purification when he instructed
him to wash three times?' He replied, 'Yes.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Using scent when going into <I>ihram</I>, what to wear when going
into <I>ihram</I>, and combing the hair and oiling it</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "People in <I>ihram</I> are permitted to smell fragant plants
and look in the mirror and can be treated with edible oil and ghee." 'Ata'
said, "People in <I>ihram</I> are permitted to wear rings and money-belts."
Ibn 'Umar did <I>tawaf</I> while in <I>ihram</I> with a cloth tied around
his belly. 'A'isha did not see anything wrong with short trousers being worn
by those who fixed her howdah.
<P>
[This is wearing them under the izar, or waist-wrapper. This was to conceal
their private parts.]
<P>
1464. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "Ibn 'Umar used to use oil
in his hair. I mentioned that to Ibrahim who said, 'What would you say about
the words al-Aswad related from 'A'isha who said, "It is as if I could visualise
the gleam of the scent in the parting of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, while he was in <I>ihram</I>"?'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#17">1465</A>. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I put scent
on the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when
he went into <I>ihram</I> and also when he came out of it before doing
<I>tawaf</I> of the House."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Someone going into <I>ihram</I> with gummed hair</B>
<P>
1466. It is related that Salim's father said, "I heard that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went into ihram with
gummed&nbsp;hair.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Assuming <I>ihram</I> at the mosque of Dhu'l-Hulayfa</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#30">1467</A>. It is related that Salim ibn 'Abdullah heard
his father say, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, never went into <I>ihram</I> except from the mosque, i.e. the mosque
of Dhu'l-Hulayfa."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: What kind of clothes should not be worn by a <I>muhrim</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#8">1468</A>. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said,
"A man said, 'Messenger of Allah, what sort of clothes should someone in
<I>ihram</I> wear?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'He should not wear a shirt, turban, trousers, burnoose
or leather socks unless he cannot find sandals in which case he can wear
leather socks, cutting off what is above the ankles. You should not wear
any clothes which have been touched by saffron or wars perfume.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: Riding alone and behind someone else during the hajj</B>
<P>
1469. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Usama rode behind the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from 'Arafa to al-Muzdalifa and
then al-Fadl rode behind him from al-Muzdalifa to Mina." He said, "Both of
them said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, continued
to say the <I>talbiya</I> until he did the stoning of the Jamra al-'Aqaba.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII What clothes, outer garments and waist-wrappers can be worn by someone
in ihram</B>
<P>
'A'isha wore red clothes when she was in <I>ihram</I> and said, "[A woman
in ihram] should not wear a part veil nor full veil. She should not wear
clothes with wars or saffron on them." Jabir said, "I do not think that red
dye (from safflower) is a scent." 'A'isha did not see any harm in a woman
wearing jewellery, or black or pink clothing, or leather socks." Ibrahim
said, "There is no harm in someone changing their clothes."
<P>
1470. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, set out with his Companions from Madina after
combing and oiling his hair and putting on his waist-wrapper and cloak. He
did not forbid wearing any cloaks or waist-wrappers except for those dyed
with saffron which clings to the skin. In the morning, he mounted his camel
at Dhu'l-Hulayfa and went on until he reached al-Bayda', where he and his
Companions said the <I>talbiya</I>, and garlanded his sacrifical camels.
That was on the 25th of Dhu'l-Qa'da. He reached Makka on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja
and did <I>tawaf</I> of the House and did sa&#180;i between Safa and Marwa.
He did not come out of <I>ihram</I> on account of the camels he had garlanded.
Then he dismounted at the highest part of Makka at al-Hajun, still in
<I>ihram</I>, and did not go near the Ka'ba after his <I>tawaf</I> of it
until after returning from 'Arafa. He instructed his Companions to do tawaf
of the House, then to go between Safa and Marwa, to cut their hair and then
to come out of <I>ihram</I>. That was provided they did not have garlanded
camels with them. For those who had their wives with them, normal relations
were then permitted, as were scent and [ordinary] clothes."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: Staying the night at Dhu'l-Hulayfa until morning</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar reported it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace.
<P>
1471. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, prayed doing four <I>rak'ats</I> at Madina and then
doing two <I>rak'ats </I>at Dhu'l-Hulayfa. Then he stayed the night until
morning at Dhu'l-Hulayfa. When he had mounted and his mount had stood up
completely, he said the <I>talbiya</I>.
<P>
1472. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> doing fou<I>r rak'ats </I>at
Madina and then <I>'Asr </I>doing two rak'ats at Dhu'l-Hulayfa." He said,
"I think that he stayed the night there until morning."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: Raising the voice in the <I>talbiya</I></B>
<P>
1473. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> doing four <I>rak'ats</I> at Madina
and then <I>'Asr</I> doing two rak'ats at Dhu'l-Hulayfa. I heard them all
calling it out together."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: The <I>Talbiya</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#28">1474</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that
the <I>talbiya</I> of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was, "I am at Your service, O Allah, I am at Your service. You
have no partner. I am at Your service. Praise and blessing belong to You,
as does the Kingdom. You have no partner."
<P>
1475. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I know how the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said the <I>talbiya</I>. It was: 'I am at
Your service, O Allah, I am at Your service. You have no partner. I am at
Your service. Praise and blessing belong to You.'"
<P>
It was corroborated by Abu Mu'awiya from al-A'mash. Another isnad from 'A'isha.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: Saying "Praise be to Allah", "Glory be to Allah", and "Allah is
Greater" before saying the <I>talbiya</I> while getting onto one's animal</B>
<P>
1476. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> with us doing four rak'ats at
Madina and then <I>'Asr</I> doing two rak'ats at Dhu'l-Hulayfa where he stayed
the night until morning. Then he got onto his mount becoming firmly settled
on it at al-Bayda' and while doing so praised Allah, glorified Him and said
'Allah is greater'. Then he said the talbiya for hajj and 'umra and the people
did the same together with him. After we arrived, he ordered the people to
come out of ihram until the Day of Tarwiya when they went into <I>ihram</I>
for the hajj." He said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
sacrificed camels with his own hand. In Madina, the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, sacrificed two white and black rams."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said that some of them said that this is from Ayyub from a
man from Anas.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: Saying the talbiya when one's mount is completely upright</B>
<P>
1477. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said the <I>talbiya</I> when his mount was completely
upright."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: Saying the <I>talbiya</I> while facing <I>qibla</I></B>
<P>
1478. It is related from Nafi', "When Ibn 'Umar prayed in the morning at
Dhu'l-Hulayfa, he ordered his mount to be brought and saddled. Then he mounted
and when his animal was completely upright, he faced the qibla, and then
continued to say the <I>talbiya</I> until he reached the Haram. Then he would
stop until reaching Dhu't-Tuwa where he stayed the night until morning. When
he had prayed the morning prayer, he did <I>ghusl</I> claiming that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had done that." Isma'il
corroborated the <I>ghusl</I> from Ayyub.
<P>
1479. It is related that Nafi' said, "When Ibn 'Umar wanted to leave for
Makka, he put on some non-scented oil and then went to the mosque of
Dhu'l-Hulayfa and prayed. Then he mounted and when his mount was completely
upright, he went into <I>ihram</I>. He said, 'That is how I saw the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: Talbiya when descending into the valley</B>
<P>
1480. It is related that Mujahid said, "We were with Ibn 'Abbas and they
mentioned the Dajjal and said, '"<I>Kafir</I>" (unbeliever) is written between
his eyes.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'I did not hear that, but I did hear him say,
"It is as if I could see Musa descending into the valley saying the
<I>talbiya</I>."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: How should a menstruating woman and woman bleeding from childbirth
go into <I>ihram</I>? </B>
<P>
<I>Ahalla</I> refers to saying the <I>talbiya</I> and <I>istahlalna</I> and<I>
ahlalna'l-hilal </I>all refer to the appearance. "<I>Istahalla</I>" is used
for rain when it comes out of the clouds. There is also what is "hallowed"
(<I>uhilla</I>) &nbsp;(5:3) to other-than-Allah, and this comes from the
crying (<I>istihlal</I>) of a child
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#232">1481</A>. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of
the Prophet, said, "We went out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, for the Farewell Hajj and we went into <I>ihram</I>
for <I>'umra</I>. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Anyone who has a sacrifical animal with him should go into
<I>ihram</I> for hajj and <I>'umra </I>and then should not come out of
<I>ihram</I> until completing both. I reached Makka while I was menstruating
and could not do <I>tawaf</I> of the House nor go between Safwa and Marwa.
I complained about this to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and he said, 'Undo your hair and comb it and go into ihram for hajj
and leave <I>'umra</I>. I did that and when we had finished hajj, the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent me with 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn
Abi Bakr to at-Tan'im.' So I did<I> 'umra</I> and he said, 'This is to compensate
for the <I>'umra </I>you missed.'"
<P>
She said, "Those who had gone into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>of the House
did <I>tawaf</I> and went between Safa and Marwa and then came out of
<I>ihram</I>. Then they did another <I>tawaf</I> after they returned from
Mina. Those who had combined the hajj and<I> 'umra </I>did only one
<I>tawaf</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXI: Someone going into <I>ihram</I> during the time of the Prophet with
exactly the same intention as the Prophet himself</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar mentioned it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace.
<P>
1482. It is related that Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, instructed 'Ali to stay in <I>ihram</I>." He mentioned what
Suraqa said.
<P>
1483. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "'Ali came from Yemen to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who asked him, 'With what
intention did you into <I>ihram</I>?' He said, 'With the same as the one
with which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went into
<I>ihram</I>.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'If it were not for the fact that I had sacrificial camels with me, I would
have come out of <I>ihram</I>.'"
<P>
Muhammad ibn Bakr added that Ibn Jurayj said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to him, 'With what intention did you into
<I>ihram</I>?' He said, 'With the same as the one with which the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went into <I>ihram</I>.' He said,
'Get a sacrificial camel and stay in <I>ihram</I> as you are.'"
<P>
1484. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, sent me to some people in the Yemen and I returned to
find him at al-Batha'. He asked, 'With what intention did you go into
<I>ihram</I>?' I replied, 'I went into <I>ihram</I> with the same intention
as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said, 'Do you
have a sacrificial animal with you?' I said, 'No.' He instructed me to do
<I>tawaf </I>of the House and to go between Safa and Marwa. Then he instructed
me to come out of <I>ihram</I>. I went to a woman of my people who combed
my hair or washed my head. Then when 'Umar came, he said, 'If we go by the
Book of Allah, it commands us to complete hajj and<I> 'umra</I>. Allah says,
<I>"Perform the hajj and 'umra for Allah," </I>(6:196) and if we take the
sunna of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he did not
come out of <I>ihram</I> until he had sacrificed his camels.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIII: The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "The hajj takes place during
well-known months. If anyone undertakes the obligation of hajj in them, there
must be no sexual intercourse, no wrongdoing, nor any quarrelling during
hajj"</I> (2:197) and His words<I>, "They will ask you about the crescent
moons. Say, 'They are set times for mankind and for the Hajj.'</I>" (2:189)
</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "The months of hajj are Shawwal, Dhu'l-Qa'da, and the ten
days of Dhu'l-Hijja." Ibn 'Abbas said, "Part of the sunna is that no one
should go into <I>ihram</I> for hajj except during the months of hajj." 'Uthman
disliked people going into <I>ihram</I> from Khorasan or Kirman.
<P>
[This means from a great distance before the miqat.]
<P>
1485. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We went out with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the months of hajj and
nights of hajj and in a state of hajj. We alighted at Sarif." She said, "He
came out to his Companions and said, 'Anyone among you who does not have
a sacrificial animal and wants to make it an <I>'umra </I>should do so. Those
who have sacrificial animals should not.'" She said, "Some of the Companions
took advantage of this and some did not." She said, "As for the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and some men among his
Companions, they were people of strong resolve and had sacrificial animals
with them, and could not do<I> 'umra</I>."
<P>
She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
found me weeping. He asked, 'What has made you weep, O Hantah?' I said, I
heard what you said to your Companions and I am prevented from doing<I>
'umra</I>.' He said, 'What is wrong with you?' I said, 'I am not praying.'
He said, 'It will not harm you. You are one of the daughters of Adam and
Allah has decreed for you what He has decreed for them. Continue with your
hajj and perhaps Allah will give it to you.'"
<P>
She said, "We went on with hajj until we reached Mina where I became pure.
Then I went out from Mina and did the <I>tawaf</I> of the House." She said,
"Then I left with him at the final departure until he alighted at al-Muhassab.
We alighted with him. He called 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr and said, 'Take
your sister out of the Haram and then she can go into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra
</I>and when you have finished come back here. I will wait until you both
come.'"
<P>
She said, "We went out until I finished. I completed the <I>tawaf</I> and
arrived back at dawn. He said, 'Did you finish?' I said, 'Yes.' He announced
the departure among his Companions and everyone set out, he himself heading
for Madina."

<I>Dayr</I> (harm) is from <I>dara</I>, <I>yadiru dayran</I>. It is said

<P>
<B>XXXIII: Hajj at-Tamattu', Hajj al-Qiran and Hajj al-Ifrad and the interrupting
of hajj for those who do not have sacrificial animals with them</B>
<P>
1486. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We went out with the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, with the intention of doing hajj alone.
When we arrived, we performed <I>tawaf</I> of the House. The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, then instructed those who had not driven
sacrificial animals to come out of <I>ihram</I>. So those who had not driven
sacrificial animals came out of <I>ihram</I> and since his wives had not
driven animals they too came out of <I>ihram</I>."
<P>
'A'isha said, "I started menstruating before I had done <I>tawaf</I> of the
House." On the night of Hasba [i.e. al-Muhassab], she said, "Messenger of
Allah, everyone is returning with<I> 'umra </I>and hajj and I am only returning
with hajj." "He said, 'Did you not do <I>tawaf</I> the night we reached Makka?'
I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Go with your brother to at-Tan'im and go into
<I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>. We will meet you at such-and-such a place.'
Safiyya said, 'I think that I will hold you up.' He said, 'What a nuisance!
Did you not do <I>tawaf</I> on the day of sacrifice?'" She said, "I said,
'Yes.' He said, 'There is no harm in departing.' 'A'isha said, 'The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, met me while he was coming up from
Makka and I was going down to it - or I was coming up and he was descending.'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#36">1487</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We went
out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
in the year of the Farewell Hajj. Some of us had gone into <I>ihram</I> for<I>
'umra</I> and some of us for hajj and<I> 'umra </I>together, and some for
hajj alone. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
went into <I>ihram</I> for hajj alone. Those who went into <I>ihram</I> for
hajj or for hajj and<I> 'umra </I>did not come out of it until the Day of
Sacrifice."
<P>
1488. It is related that Marwan ibn al-Hakam said, "I saw 'Uthman and 'Ali
when 'Uthman forbade the <I>tamattu' </I>and joining them together
(<I>qiran</I>). When 'Ali saw this, he said "<I>Labbayk</I>" for<I> 'umra
</I>and hajj together [i.e. for <I>qiran</I>). He stated, 'I will not leave
the <I>sunna</I> of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
no matter what anyone says.'"
<P>
1489. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "They used to think that <I>'umra
</I>during the months of hajj was one of the most heinous actions anyone
could do. They would consider al-Muharram to be Safar and would say, 'When
the wounds on the back of the camel heal and the scar has gone and Safar
has passed, then <I>'umra</I> is lawful for anyone who wants to do it.' The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his Companions arrived
on the morning of the fourth of Dhu'l-Hijja, having assumed <I>ihram</I>
for the hajj, and he told them to make it an <I>'umra</I>. They thought that
extraordinary and said, 'Messenger of Allah, what sort of coming out of
<I>ihram</I> is it?' He replied, 'A total coming out of <I>ihram</I>.'"
<P>
1490. It is related that Abu Musa said, "I came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and he instructed me to come out of
<I>ihram</I>."
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#189">1491</A>. It is related that Hafsa, the wife of the
Prophet, asked, "Messenger of Allah, what are the people doing coming out
of <I>ihram</I> on account of doing <I>'umra </I>when you have not come out
of <I>ihram</I>?' He replied, 'I have gummed my hair and garlanded my sacrificial
camels so I will not come out of <I>ihram</I> until I have sacrificed.'"
<P>
1492. It is related that Abu Jamra Nasr ibn 'Imran ad-Duba'i said, "I wanted
to do<I> tamattu' </I>and people forbade me [to do that.] So I asked Ibn
'Abbas and he told me to do it. I had a dream in which a man was saying to
me, 'An accepted hajj and an accepted <I>'umra</I>.' I told Ibn 'Abbas and
he said, 'The sunna of Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'
Then he told me, 'Stay with me and I will allot you a portion of my property.'"
Shu'ba said, "I said, 'Why?' He said, 'Because of the dream I had.'"
<P>
1493. It is related that Abu Shihab said, "I came to Makka intending to
perfrom<I> tamattu' </I>for<I> 'umra</I>. We entered three days before Tarwiya
(8 Dhu'l-Hijja]. Some of the people of Makka said to me, 'Now your hajj will
become Makkan.' I went in to 'Ata' to ask his opinion. He said, 'Jabir ibn
'Abdullah related to me that he went on hajj with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, on the day when he drove the camels with him.
They had gone into <I>ihram</I> for hajj alone (<I>ifrad</I>). He told them,
"Come out of <I>ihram</I> after the <I>tawaf</I> of the House an<I>d sa'y
</I>between Safa and Marwa, cut your hair and then stay out of <I>ihram</I>
until the day of Tarwiya. Then go into <I>ihram</I> for the hajj. Make your
first intention <I>tamattu'</I>." They said, "How can we make it<I>
tamattu</I>' when we called it hajj?" He said, "Do as I have instructed you.
If it were not that I have driven sacrificial animals, I would have done
the same I have instructed you, but I cannot come out of <I>ihram</I> until
the sacrifice reaches its place." They did that.'"
<P>
1494. It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "'Ali and 'Uthman disagreed
about<I> tamattu' </I>when they were at 'Usfan. 'Ali said, 'You are trying
to forbid something which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, did.' When 'Ali saw that, he went into ihram for both together
(<I>qiran</I>)."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIV: Someone saying the <I>talbiya</I> for hajj and specifying it</B>
<P>
1495. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah, "We came with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying, 'At Your service,
O Allah, at Your service for the hajj.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, instructed us to make it <I>'umra</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXV: <I>At-Tamattu' </I></B>
<P>
1496. It is related that 'Imran said, "We did <I>tamattu' </I>in the time
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then
the Qur'an was revealed about it, but a particular man expressed the opinion
he wished to."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVI: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"that is for anyone whose family
does not live near the Masjid al-Haram."</I> (2:196)</B>
<P>
<B> </B>1497. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas was asked about the Hajj at-Tamattu'
and said, "The Muhajirun and the Ansar and the wives of the Prophet went
into <I>ihram</I> for the Farewell Hajj and we went into <I>ihram</I> too.
When we reached Makka, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Consider your <I>ihram</I> for hajj <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra
</I>- except for those who have garlanded sacrificial animals.' We did
<I>tawaf</I> of the House and did <I>sa'y </I>between Safa and Marwa, and
then went to our wives and put on our (normal) clothes. He said, 'Anyone
who has garlanded his sacrificial animal should not come out of <I>ihram</I>
until the sacrifice reaches its place.' Then on the eve of Tarwiya he told
us to go into <I>ihram</I> for hajj. When we finished the rites, we came
and did <I>tawaf</I> of the House and did <I>sa'y </I>between Safa and Marwa.
Our hajj was complete and we had to sacrifice, in compliance with the words
of Allah Almighty:<I> 'he should make whatever sacrifice is feasible. For
anyone who cannot, there is three days' fast on hajj and seven on your return'
</I>(2:196) to your cities, a sheep being sufficient. So they combined two
practices - hajj and<I> 'umra </I>- in the same year. Allah Almighty sent
it down in His Book and it was the Sunna of His Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. It was allowed to people other than the people of
Makka. Allah says,<I> 'that is for anyone whose family does not live near
the Masjid al-Haram.'</I>
<P>
<I> </I>The months of hajj which Allah Almighty mentioned are Shawwal,
Dhu'l-Qa'da and Dhu'l-Hijja. Whoever does <I>tamattu</I>' in these months
must sacrifice or fast." <I>Rafath</I> means sexual relations, <I>fusuq</I>
refers to acts of rebellion against Allah and <I>jidal</I> means quarrelling.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: Doing <I>ghusl</I> when entering Makka</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#6">1498</A>. It is related that Nafi' said, "When Ibn
'Umar entered the borders of the Haram, he would stop doing the
<I>talbiya</I> and then stay the night at Dhu't-Tuwa. He would pray
<I>Subh</I> there and do <I>ghusl</I>. He related that the Prophet of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had done that."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVIII: Entering Makka by day or night</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stayed the night at
Dhu't-Tuwa until morning and then entered Makka. Ibn 'Umar used to do that.
<P>
1499. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, stayed the night at Dhu't-Tuwa until morning and then
entered Makka." Ibn 'Umar used to do that too.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: Where to enter Makka</B>
<P>
1500. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to enter Makka by the higher route and
leave by the lower route."
<P>
<P>
<B>XL: Where to leave Makka</B>
<P>
1501. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, entered Makka from Kada' by the higher route
which is at al-Batha', and left by the lower route.
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "It is said that he is Musaddad [meaning upright, correct]
like his name." Abu 'Abdullah said, "I heard Yahya ibn Ma'in say that he
heard Yahya ibn Sa'id say, 'If I had come to Musaddad in his house and I
had related it, he would have deserved that, no matter what books I or Musaddad
might have.'"
<P>
[Kada' is a mountain in upper Makka. The higher route descends to the cemetery
of Makka.]
<P>
1502. It is related from 'A'isha that when the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came to Makka, he entered from the higher part and left
from the lower.
<P>
1503. It is related from 'A'isha that in the year of the Conquest the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered by Kada' and left by Kuda,
in the upper part of Makka.
<P>
It is related from 'A'isha that in the year of the Conquest the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered by Kada' in upper Makka.
<P>
Hisham said, "'Urwa used to enter by both Kada' and Kuda. He often entered
by Kada' which was nearer to his home."
<P>
1504. It is related from 'Urwa, "In the year of the Conquest the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered Makka by Kada' in upper
Makka." Hisham said, "'Urwa often used to enter by Kada' which was nearer
to his home."
<P>
It is related from the father of Hisham, "In the year of the Conquest the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered by Kada'. 'Urwa
used to enter by both [Kada' and Kuda]. He often entered by Kada' which was
nearer to his home."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "Kada' and Kuda are two places."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLI: The excellence of Makka and its buildings</B>
<P>
The words of Allah, <I>"And when We made the House a place to return to,
a sanctuary for mankind: 'Take the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.'
We contracted with Ibrahim and Isma'il to: 'Purify My House for those who
circle it, and those who stay there, and those who bow and who prostrate.'
And when Ibrahim said, 'My Lord, make this a place of safety and provide
its inhabitants with fruits &#150; all of them who believe in Allah and the
Last Day.' He said, 'I will let him who rejects enjoy himself a little and
then I will drive him to the punishment of the Fire. What an evil destination!'
And when Ibrahim built the foundations of the House with Isma'il: 'Our Lord,
accept this from us! You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Our Lord,
make us both Muslims submitted to You, and our descendants a Muslim nation
submitted to You. Show us our rites of worship and turn to Us You are the
Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful." </I>(2:125-128)
<P>
1505. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "When the Ka'ba was being
rebuilt, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went with
'Abbas to move stones. Al-'Abbas said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, 'Put your waist-wrapper round your neck.' He fell to
the earth with his eyes staring up into the sky and said, 'Give me my
waist-wrapper,' and he girded himself with it."
<P>
1506. It is related from 'A'isha , the wife of the Prophet, that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, "Do you not
know that when your people rebuilt the Ka'ba, they made it smaller in area
than the original foundations of Ibrahim?" [She said,] "So I asked, 'Messenger
of Allah, why then do you not rebuild it again on the foundations of Ibrahim?'
He replied, 'If it had not been that your people were only recently unbelievers,
I would have done that.'" 'Abdullah said, "'A'isha heard this from the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. I believe that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, only omitted to touch
the two corners opposite al-Hijr because it was not completed on the foundations
of Ibrahim."
<P>
1507. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I asked the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, about the wall and whether it was part of the House.
He said, 'Yes.' I asked, 'Why then have they not included it in the House?'
He replied, 'Do you not see that your people were short of funds?' I said,
'What about its door being high off the ground?' He said, 'Your people did
that so they could admit whom they wanted and bar entry to whom they wanted.
If it were not for the fact that your people are still close to the time
of <I>Jahiliyya</I>, making me afraid that their hearts might be averse to
it, I would make the wall part of the House and lower its door to ground
level.'"
<P>
1508. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'Were it not that your people
were recently unbelievers, I would have demolished the House and then rebuilt
it on the foundations of Ibrahim, peace and blessing be upon him. Quraysh
have been incomplete in its construction. I would also have given it a back
door.'"
<P>
Abu Mu'awiya said, "Hisham related to us, '<I>khalfan</I>, in other words,
"door".'"
<P>
1509. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to her, "'A'isha, if it were it not for the fact that
your people are close to the time of <I>Jahiliyya</I>, I would have commanded
that the House be destroyed and would have included in it what has been left
out of it, would have made it level with the ground, and would have given
it two doors - an eastern door and a western door. This would have brought
it back to the foundations of Ibrahim." It is this that prompted Ibn az-Zubayr
to destroy it.
<P>
Yazid said, "I saw Ibn az-Zubayr when he destroyed it and rebuilt it and
included in it part of al-Hijr. I saw the foundations of Ibrahim which consisted
of stones like the humps of camels." Jarir said, "I asked him, 'Where exactly
is it?' He said, 'I will show you now.' I went in al-Hijr with him.' He indicated
a place and said, 'It is here.'" Jarir said, "I reckon it to have been about
six cubits from al-Hijr."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLII: The excellence of the Haram</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "I have simply been commanded to worship
the Lord of this land which He has declared sacred &#150; everything belongs
to Him &#150; and I have been ordered to be one of the Muslims,"</I> (27:91)
and His words, may His mention be exalted, <I>"Have We not established a
safe haven for them to which produce of every kind is brought, provision
direct from Us? But most of them do not know not it.</I>" (28:57)
<P>
1510. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "On the day of the Conquest of
Makka, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Allah has made this city sacred. Its thorns should not be cut, its game
should not be hunted and something dropped should not be picked up except
by someone who announces it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIII: The inheritance, sale and purchase of the houses of Makka. People
are the same in respect of the Masjid al-Haram</B>
<P>
This is especially since Allah Almighty says,<I> "Those who reject and bar
access to the Way of Allah and to the Sacred Mosque which We have appointed
for all mankind &#150; equally for those who live near it and those who come
from far away &#150; those who desire to profane it with wrongdoing, We will
let them taste a painful punishment."</I> (22:25)
<P>
1511. It is related that Usama ibn Zayd asked, "Messenger of Allah, where
will you stay? In your house in Makka?" He replied, "Did 'Aqil leave any
property or houses?" 'Aqil and Talib had inherited from Abu Talib, but Ja'far
and 'Ali had not inherited anything because they were Muslims and 'Aqil and
Talib were unbelievers. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab used to say, "The believer does
not inherit from the unbeliever."
<P>
Ibn Shihab said, "They deduced this from the words of Allah Almighty,<I>
'Those who believe and have emigrate and done jihad with their wealth and
themselves in the Way of Allah, and those who give refuge and helped, they
are the friends and protectors of one another.'</I>" (8:72)
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIV: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, staying in
Makka</B>
<P>
1512. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on the point of entering Makka,
he said, 'Our stopping place tomorrow will, Allah willing, be Khayf Bani
Kinana where they took the oath of disbelief.'"
<P>
1513. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said on the morning of the Day of Sacrifice when
he was at Mina, 'Tomorrow we will stop at Khayf Bani Kinana, where they took
the oath of disbelief,' meaning by that, al-Muhassab, where Quraysh and Kinana
had formed a mutual alliance against the Banu Hashim and Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib,
or the Banu al-Muttalib, that they would not inter-marry with them nor conduct
any business with them until they surrendered the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, to them."
<P>
Salama and Yahya said from Ibn Shihab, "The Banu Hashim and Banu'l-Muttalib."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "The Banu'l-Muttalib is more likely."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLV: The words of Allah the Mighty and Exalted, <I>"When Ibrahim said,
'My Lord! Make this land a place of safety and keep me and my sons from
worshipping idols. My Lord! They have misguided many of mankind. If anyone
follows me, he is with me but if anyone disobeys me, You are Ever-Forgiving,
Most Merciful. Our Lord! I have settled some of my offspring by Your Sacred
House in a valley with no cultivation. Our Lord! May they establish the prayer!
Make the hearts of mankind incline towards them...'"</I> (14:35-37)</B>
<P>
<P>
<B>XLVI: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Allah has made the Ka&Ocirc;ba,
the Sacred House, a special institution for mankind, and also the sacred
months and the sacrificial animals and the ritual garlands. That is so you
will know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth
and that Allah has knowledge of all things."</I> (5:97)</B>
<P>
1514. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Dhu's-Suwayqatayn from Abyssinia will demolish
the Ka'ba."
<P>
[Dhu's-Suwayqatayn: lit. "the one with two thin, weak legs.]
<P>
1515. It is related that 'A'isha said, "They used to fast the Day of 'Ashura'
before Ramadan was made obligatory. It was the day on which the Ka'ba was
covered. When Allah made Ramadan obligatory, the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who wishes to fast it
may do so and anyone who wishes to leave it may do so."
<P>
1516. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Hajj and <I>'umra</I> to the House
should continue after the coming of Ya'juj and Ma'juj."
<P>
Aban and 'Imran corroborated it from Qatada. It is related that Shu'ba said,
"The Hour will not come until the time when people no longer go on hajj to
the House." The first statement is more common. 'Abdullah ibn Abi 'Utba heard
Qatada and 'Abdullah heard Abu Sa'id.
<P>
<P>
<B>XLVII: The <I>kiswa</I> (covering) of the Ka'ba</B>
<P>
1517. It is related that Abu Wa'il said, "I sat with Shayba on the chair
in the Ka'ba. He said, ''Umar sat in this place and said, "I am not intending
to leave any gold or silver here without distributing it.' I remarked, 'Your
two companions did not do it.' He said, 'They are the two people I emulate.'"
<P>
[He means the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr]
<P>
<P>
<B>XLVIII: Demolishing the Ka'ba</B>
<P>
'A'isha said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"An army will attack the Ka'ba and will be swallowed up by the earth."
<P>
1518. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "It is as if I could see a bandy-legged black
man taking down its stones one by one."
<P>
1519. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Dhu's-Suwayqatayn from Abyssinia will
demolish the Ka'ba."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIX: What is recorded about the Black Stone</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#116">1520</A>. It is related from 'Umar that he came to
the Black Stone and kissed it and said, "I know that you are a stone which
can bestow neither harm nor benefit. If it had not been that I had seen the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, kiss you, I
would not have kissed you."
<P>
<P>
<B>L: Shutting the door of the House and praying in any part of the House
one wishes</B>
<P>
1521. It is related from Salim that his father said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered the House with Usama ibn
Zayd, Bilal and 'Uthman ibn Abi Talha. They closed the door. When they opened
it again, I was the first to enter. I met Bilal and asked him, 'Did the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray?' He said, 'Yes,
between the two right hand columns.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LI: Praying in the Ka'ba</B>
<P>
1522. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that whenever he entered the Ka'ba, he
would walk straight ahead from where he entered with the door behind him
and would walk forward until there was about three cubits between him and
the wall in front of him. He would pray there with the intention of praying
in the same place where Bilal had informed him that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed. But there is no harm in
anyone praying in any corner of the House he likes.
<P>
<P>
<B>LII: Someone not going inside the Ka'ba.</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar used to go on hajj often without going inside it.
<P>
1523. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on<I> 'umra</I>. He performed
<I>tawaf</I> of the House and then prayed two rak'ats behind the Maqam. With
him were those shielding him from the people." A man asked 'Abdullah, "Did
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, go into
the Ka'ba?" He replied, "No."
<P>
<P>
<B>LIII: Someone saying the <I>takbir</I> inside the Ka'ba</B>
<P>
1524. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came, he refused to enter the House
as long as there were idols in it. He commanded that they be taken out and
they were. They brought out a picture showing Ibrahim and Isma'il holding
divining arrows in their hands. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'Allah curse them! By Allah, they know that neither
of them ever used these things.' He entered the House and said the
<I>takbir</I> in each of its corners but did not pray in it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LIV: How the <I>ramal</I> (fast walking) began</B>
<P>
1525. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and his Companions arrived and the idolaters
said that they had arrived weakened by the fever of Yathrib. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded them to walk fast for
the first three circuits, walking normally between the two corners. If it
had not been for his kind-heartedness towards them he would have commanded
them to walk fast for every one of the circuits."
<P>
<P>
<B>LV: Touching the Black Stone when arriving in Makka at the beginning of
the <I>tawaf</I> and walking fast for three circuits</B>
<P>
1526. It is related from Salim that his father said, "I saw the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, arrive in Makka. He touched
the corner of the Black Stone at the beginning of his <I>tawaf</I> and he
walked fast in the first three circuits of the seven."
<P>
<P>
<B>LVI: Walking fast in both hajj and 'umra</B>
<P>
1527. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, walked fast for three circuits and walked normally for
four in both hajj and <I>'umra</I>."
<P>
It is corroborated from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
1528. It is related from Zayd ibn Aslam from his father that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
said to the Corner, "I know that you are a stone which can bestow neither
harm nor benefit. If it had not been that I had seen the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, touch you, I would not have touched
you." So he touched it and then said, "We only walked fast because we were
showing off to the idolaters and Allah has now destroyed them." Then he said,
"But it is something which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, did so we do not like to abandon it."
<P>
1529. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "I have never failed to kiss these
two corners under any circumstance since I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, touch them." 'Ubaydullah said, "I asked Nafi', 'Did
Ibn 'Umar walk normally between the two corners?' He said, 'He walked so
that it would be easier for him to touch it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LVII: Touching the stone with a stick</B> <B>with a curved end</B>
<P>
1530. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, did <I>tawaf</I> in the Farewell Hajj on a camel and
touched the Corner with a stick with a curved end."
<P>
Ad-Darawardi corroborated it from the nephew of az-Zuhri from his uncle.
<P>
<P>
<B>LVIII: Someone touching only the two Yemeni corners</B>
<P>
Abu'sh-Sha'tha said, "Who keeps away from any of the House?" Mu'awiya used
to touch all [four] corners and Ibn 'Abbas said to him, "These two corners
should not be touched." He replied, "None of the House should be neglected."
Ibn az-Zubayr used to touch all of them"
<P>
1531. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "I did not see the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, touch any part of the House except the
two Yemeni corners."
<P>
<P>
<B>LIX: Kissing the Black Stone</B>
<P>
1532. It is related that Aslam said, "I saw 'Umar ibn al-Khattab kiss the
Stone and he said, 'If it had not been that I had seen the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, kiss you, I would not have kissed
you.'"
<P>
1533. It is related that az-Zubayr ibn 'Arabi said, "A man asked Ibn 'Umar
about touching the Stone. He said, 'I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, touch it and kiss it.' He said, 'I said, "What
about if there is a crush?' What about if I am overpowered?" He said, "Leave
'what about' in the Yemen! I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, touch it and kiss it."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LX: Someone pointing towards the Corner when he reaches it</B>
<P>
1534. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, did <I>tawaf</I> of the House on a camel. Each time
he reached the Corner, he pointed towards it."

<P>
1535. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, did <I>tawaf</I> of the House on a camel. Each time
he reached the Corner, he pointed towards it with something he was holding
and said the <I>takbir</I>."
<P>
Ibrahim ibn Tahman corroborated it from Khalid al-Hadhdha'.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXII: Someone doing tawaf of the House on arriving in Makka before returning
to his house and then praying two rak'ats and going out to Safa</B>
<P>
1536. It is related that 'Urwa said that'A'isha informed him that the first
thing the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did when he arrived
was <I>wudu'</I>. Then he did <I>tawaf</I> which was not for <I>'umra</I>.
Then Abu Bakr and 'Umar did hajj the same way. [He said,] "Then I went on
hajj with my father, az-Zubayr and the first thing he did was the
<I>tawaf</I>. Then I saw the Muhajirun and Ansar doing that. [He said, ]
My mother informed me that she, her sister, az-Zubayr and certain other people,
when they had gone into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>, would come out of
it after touching the Corner."
<P>
1537. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used, in both hajj and <I>'umra</I>,
to do <I>tawaf</I> when he first arrived, walking fast for three circuits
and normally for four, then do two rak'ats and then go between Safa and Marwa.
<P>
1538. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that, when the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, did the first tawaf of the House, he
would trot for three circuits and walk normally for four and he would also
run in the bottom of the water course when going between Safa and Marwa.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIII: Women doing <I>tawaf</I> together with men</B>
<P>
1539. Ibn Jurayj said, "'Ata' informed us that when Ibn Hisham forbade women
to do <I>tawaf</I> with the men, he said, 'How can you forbid them when the
wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did
<I>tawaf</I> with the men?' I said, 'Was this before or after the veil?'
He replied, 'On my life, I saw it after the veil!' I said, 'How did they
mix with the men?' He said, 'They did not mix. 'A'isha used to do
<I>tawaf</I> apart from the men without mixing with them. A woman said, 'Let
us go and touch (the Stone), Mother of the Believers.' She said, 'Go without
me,' and she refused to go. They used to go out veiled at night and do
<I>tawaf</I> with the men, but if they wanted to enter the House, they would
wait to enter until the men had left. I and 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr used to visit
'A'isha when she was residing at Jawf Thabit.' I asked, 'What was her veil?'
He said, 'She was in a small woollen tent with a covering, and there was
only that between us and her. I could see that she was wearing a rose-coloured
shirt.'"
<P>
1540. It is related that Umm Salama,, the wife of the Prophet, said, "I
complained to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
that I was ill and he said, 'Do <I>tawaf</I> riding behind the people.' So
I did <I>tawaf</I> while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was praying beside the House, reciting <I>"By Sinai and
the inscribed Book..." </I>(52)'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIV: Speaking during tawaf</B>
<P>
1541. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that while the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was doing <I>tawaf</I> of the House, he passed someone
who had tied his hand to another man with a leather strip or string or something.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cut it and ordered,
'Lead him by the hand.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXV: Someone seeing a leather strip or something he dislikes in
<I>tawaf</I> and cutting it</B>
<P>
1542. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, saw a man doing <I>tawaf</I> of the House with a rein
or something else and cut it.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVI: Not doing tawaf naked and idolaters not performing hajj</B>
<P>
1543. It is related from Abu Hurayra that, during the hajj over which the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, put Abu Bakr
in charge the year before the Farewell Hajj, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq sent him
on the Day of Sacrifice with a group of people to announce among the people:
"After this year no idolater may go on hajj and no naked person may do
<I>tawaf</I> of the House."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVII: When someone stops during tawaf</B>
<P>
'Ata' said, about someone who is doing <I>tawaf</I> when the iqama for the
prayer is given and is then pushed from his place, that, after he has said
the <I>taslim</I>, he should return to the place where he left off." Something
similar to this is mentioned from Ibn 'Umar and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVIII: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed two
rak'ats after seven circuits</B>
<P>
Nafi' said, "Ibn 'Umar used to pray two rak'ats for every seven circuits."
Isma'il ibn Umayya said, "I told az-Zuhri that 'Ata' said, 'The obligatory
prayer takes the place of the two rak'ats of the <I>tawaf</I>.' He [az-Zuhri]
said, 'The <I>sunna</I> is better. Whenever the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, did seven circuits of <I>tawaf</I>, he prayed two
<I>rak'ats</I>.'"
<P>
1544. It is related from 'Amr, "We asked Ibn 'Umar, 'Is it permitted for
a man doing <I>'umra </I>to have sexual relations with his wife before he
goes between Safa and Marwa?' He replied, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came and did seven circuits of the House.
Then he prayed two rak'ats behind the Maqam and then went between Safa and
Marwa.' He said, 'You have a good model in the Messenger of Allah.'" He said,
"I asked Jabir ibn 'Abdullah and he said, 'He should not approach his wife
until he has gone between Safa and Marwa.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIX: Someone not going near the Ka'ba and not doing <I>tawaf</I> after
the first <I>tawaf</I> until returning from 'Arafa </B>
<P>

and grant him peace, arrived in Makka, did <I>tawaf</I> and<I> sa'y </I>between
Safa and Marwa and did not go near the Ka'ba after his first <I>tawaf</I>
until he had returned from 'Arafa."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXX: Someone praying two <I>rak'ats</I> for <I>tawaf</I> outside the
Mosque</B>
<P>
'Umar prayed outside the Haram
<P>
1546. It is related that Umm Salama, said, "I complained to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace..." "It is related from
Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet, that when the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in Makka wanting to leave, Umm Salama
had not yet done <I>tawaf</I> of the House and she also wanted to leave.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told her,
"After the <I>iqama</I> for <I>Subh</I> prayer has been given, then do
<I>tawaf</I> on your camel while the people are praying." She did that and
did not pray until she had come out."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXI: Someone praying the two rak'ats of <I>tawaf</I> behind the Maqam</B>
<P>
1547. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, arrived in Makka, did seven circuits of the House and
prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> behind the Maqam. Then he went out to Safa. Allah
Almighty says, <I>'You have a good model in the Messenger of Allah.</I>'
(33:21)"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXII: <I>Tawaf</I> after <I>Subh</I> and <I>'Asr</I></B>
<P>
<I> </I>Ibn 'Umar used to pray the two <I>rak'ats</I> for <I>tawaf</I> before
the sun rose and 'Umar did <I>tawaf</I> after the <I>Subh</I> prayer and
then rode until he prayed two<I> rak'ats </I>at Dhu Tuwa.
<P>
1548. It is related from 'A'isha that some people did <I>tawaf</I> of the
House after the <I>Subh</I> prayer and then sat listening to someone teaching
until the sun rose. Then they stood up and prayed. 'A'isha said, "They sat
until it was the hour in which it is disliked to pray and then stood up to
pray."
<P>
1549. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbid praying before sunrise and at sunset."
<P>
1550. It is related that 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn Rufay' said, "I saw 'Abdullah
ibn az-Zubayr doing tawaf before <I>Fajr</I> and then praying two
<I>rak'ats</I>.." 'Abdu'l-'Aziz said, "And I saw 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr
pray two rak'ats after <I>'Asr</I>." 'A'isha reported that whenever the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered her house, he prayed these
two.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIII: Someone who is ill may do <I>tawaf</I> while mounted</B>
<P>
1551. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, did <I>tawaf</I> of the House while he was
on a camel. Each time he came to the Corner, he pointed towards it with something
in his hand and said the <I>takbir</I>.
<P>
1552. It is related that Umm Salama said, "I complained to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that I was ill and he
said, 'Do tawaf while riding behind the people.' So I did <I>tawaf</I> while
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was praying
beside the House, reciting <I>"By Sinai and the inscribed Book..." </I>(52)'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIV: Providing water for the pilgrims</B>
<P>
1553. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib
asked the permission of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, to spend the nights in Makka in order to give water, and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave him permission."
<P>
1554. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came to the watering-place and asked for water.
Al-'Abbas said, "O Fadl! Go to your mother and bring the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, something to drink." He said, "Let
me drink." He said, "Messenger of Allah, the people have put their hands
in it." He said, "Let me drink." He drank from it and then went to Zamzam
where some people were giving water and others working to get it. He said,
"Carry on working! You are doing a righteous action." Then he said, "If it
were not that you would be overcome, I would have come down and put the rope
on this," meaning his shoulder and he pointed to his shoulder.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXV: What is said about Zamzam</B>
<P>
1555. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that Abu Dharr related that the Messenger
of Allah said, "The roof of my house was opened while I was in Makka and
Jibril, peace be upon him, descended. He opened my breast and then washed
it with the water of Zamzam. Then he brought a golden basin filled with wisdom
and belief and poured it into my breast and closed it again. Then he took
my hand and ascended with me to the lowest heaven and Jibril said to the
guardian of the lowest heaven, 'Open!' He demanded, 'Who is this?' He said,
'Jibril.'"
<P>
1556. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I gave water to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Zamzam and he drank
while standing."
<P>
'Asim said, "'Ikrima swore that on that day he was riding a camel."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVI: The <I>tawaf</I> of someone doing Hajj al-Qiran</B>
<P>
1557. It is related from 'A'isha, "We went out with the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Farewell Hajj and went into
<I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>'. Then he said, 'Whoever has a sacrifical animal
with him should go into <I>ihram</I> for hajj and <I>'umra </I>and should
not come out of <I>ihram</I> until he has completed both.' I reached Makka
while I was menstruating When we had finished our hajj, he sent me to at-Tan'im
with 'Abdu'r-Rahman and I did <I>'umra</I>. He, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'This is to compensate for the <I>'umra</I> you missed.'
Those who had gone into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I> of the House came out
of ihram and then did another <I>tawaf</I> after they returned from Mina.
Those who had combined hajj and<I> 'umra </I>did only one <I>tawaf</I>."
<P>
1558. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar's son, 'Abdullah, entered his
house on his mount and said, "I am not at all certain that there will not
be fighting between people which will bar your way to the House so I sugggest
you stay put?." He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, went out on hajj while the unbelievers of Quraysh were between
him and the House. If something comes between me and the House, I will do
as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did.<I>
'You have a good model in the Messenger of Allah.' </I>(33:21)" Then he said,
"I testify to you that I have gone into <I>ihram</I> to do hajj with 'umra."
Then he came and did one <I>tawaf</I> for both of them.
<P>
[The fighting was between 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr and al-Hajjaj.]
<P>
1559. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar wanted to go on hajj in the
year in which al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn az-Zubayr. He was told, "There might
be fighting between them. We fear that they will bar your way." He said,
"<I>'You have a good model in the Messenger of Allah.</I>' (33:21) Therefore
I will act as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
did. I testify to you that I have gone into <I>ihram</I> for<I> 'umra</I>."
<P>
Then he set out until he reached al-Bayda' and said, "The business of the
hajj and <I>'umra</I> is the same. I testify to you that I went into
<I>ihram</I> to do hajj with '<I>umra</I>." He drove a sacrificial animal
that he had purchased at Qudayd and did not do more than that. He did not
slaughter nor come out of <I>ihram</I> at all nor shave nor shorten his hair
until the Day of Sacrifice. He sacrificed and shaved his head and considered
that he had fulfilled the <I>tawaf</I> of both hajj and<I> 'umra</I> with
his first <I>tawaf</I>." Ibn 'Umar said, "That is how the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVII: <I>Tawaf</I> while in <I>wudu'</I></B>
<P>
1560. It is related that Muhammad ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Nawfal al-Qurayshi
asked 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr [about the hajj of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace]. He replied, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, performed hajj and 'A'isha informed me that the first thing
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did when he arrived
was<I> wudu</I>'. Then he did <I>tawaf</I> which was not for <I>'umra</I>.
Then Abu Bakr did hajj and the first thing he did was <I>tawaf</I> of the
House which was not for <I>'umra</I>. Then 'Umar did hajj the same way. Then
'Uthman went on hajj and I saw that the first thing he did was tawaf of the
House which was not for 'umra. Then there was Mu'awiya and 'Abdullah ibn
'Umar. Then I went on hajj with Abu'z-Zubayr and the first thing he did was
the <I>tawaf</I> of the House. Then I saw the Muhajirun and Ansar doing that,
and that it was not for <I>'umra</I>. The last person I saw doing it was
Ibn 'Umar and he did not complete it as <I>'umra</I>. Now here is Ibn 'Umar
among them and they do not ask him! None of those who went before did anything
until they had placed their feet in the <I>tawaf</I> of the House and they
would not then come out of <I>ihram</I>. I saw my mother and my aunt when
they came. They did not do anything before doing <I>tawaf</I> of the House
and they too did not then come out of <I>ihram</I>. My mother informed me
that when she, her sister and az-Zubayr and certain other people went into
<I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>, and after touching the Corner they would come
out of <I>ihram</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVIII: The obligation of Safa and Marwa and the fact that it is one
of the waymarks of Allah</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#130">1561</A>. It is related that 'Urwa said, "I asked
'A'isha, 'What do you think of the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Safa and
Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks of Allah, so anyone who goes on hajj
to the House or does 'umra incurs no wrong in going back and forth between
them." </I>(2:158) By Allah, so there is no harm in not going between Safa
and Marwa.' She said, 'My nephew, what you say is wrong. If it was as you
say, it would have been, "There is no harm in him not doing <I>tawaf</I>
between them." However, it was sent down about the Ansar who used previously
to go into <I>ihram</I> for the idol Manat which they used to worship at
al-Mushallal. Those going into <I>ihram</I> considered it a sin to do
<I>tawaf</I> between Safa and Marwa. When they became Muslim, they asked
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about that,
saying, 'Messenger of Allah, we used to consider it to be a sin to do
<I>tawaf</I> between Safa and Marwa.' So Allah Almighty sent down, <I>'Safa
and Marwa are among the waymarks of Allah...' </I>'A'isha said, 'The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made a sunna of doing <I>tawaf</I>
between the two of them, so no one should neglect to do <I>tawaf</I> between
them.'
<P>
"Then I informed 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr and he said, 'I have not heard
this. I did hear some of the people of knowledge saying that the people -
except for those 'A'isha mentioned who went into <I>ihram</I> for Manat -
all used to do <I>tawaf</I> of Safa and Marwa. When Allah Almighty mentioned
<I>tawaf</I> of the House and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Qur'an,
they said, "Messenger of Allah, we used also to do <I>tawaf</I> around Safa
and Marwa and Allah has revealed <I>tawaf</I> of the House without mentioning
Safa. Is it a sin for us to do <I>tawaf</I> of Safa and Marwa?" Allah Almighty
then revealed,<I> "Safa and Marwa are among the waymarks of Allah..."</I>'
<P>
"Abu Bakr said, 'I heard that this <I>ayat</I> was revealed about both groups,
those who used to consider it a sin to do <I>tawaf</I> of Safa and Marwa
in the time of <I>Jahiliyya</I>, and those who had done <I>tawaf</I> of them
and then considered it a sin to do it in Islam because Allah Almighty had
commanded <I>tawaf</I> of the House without mentioning Safa, only speaking
of it after what He said about <I>tawaf</I> of the House.'"
<P>
[al-Mushallal is a place close to al-Juhfa. They considered <I>tawaf</I>
between them to be sinful because two idols had been there: Isaf and Na'ila]]
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIX: What has come about <I>sa'y</I> between Safa and Marwa</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "Sa'y is from the house of the Banu 'Abbad to the alley of
the Banu Abi Husayn."
<P>
1562. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, did the first <I>tawaf</I>, he went
fast for three circuits and walked normally for four. He used to run on the
bottom on the water-course when he went between Safa and Marwa."
<P>
['Ubaydullah ibn 'Umar said,] "I asked Nafi', 'Did 'Abdullah walk when he
reached the Yemeni corner?' He replied, 'No. Unless there was a crowd at
the Corner, he would not leave it without touching it.'"
<P>
1563. It is related that Ibn Dinar said, "We asked Ibn 'Umar about a man
who had done <I>tawaf</I> of the House in his<I> 'umr</I>a but had not yet
gone between Safa and Marwa, was he permitted to have sexual relations with
his wife? He replied, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
came and did seven circuits of the House and prayed two rak'ats behind the
Maqam and did tawaf of Safa and Marwa seven times. <I>"You have a good model
in the Messenger of Allah.</I>"' We asked Jabir ibn 'Abdullah and he said,
'He should not approach her until he has done <I>tawaf</I> between Safa and
Marwa.'"
<P>
1564. It is related that Ibn Dinar said, "I heard Ibn 'Umar say, 'The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came and did <I>tawaf</I> of the
House and prayed two rak'ats and did <I>sa'y </I>between Safa and Marwa '.
Then he recited, <I>'You have a good model in the Messenger of Allah.'</I>"
<P>
1565. It is related that 'Asim said, "I said to Anas ibn Malik, 'Did you
used to dislike doing <I>sa'y</I> between Safa and Marwa?' He said, 'Yes,
because they were two of the waymarks of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>, until Allah
sent down, <I>'"afa and Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks of Allah, so
anyone who goes on hajj to the House or does 'umra incurs no wrong in going
back and forth between them.'</I>"
<P>
1566. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, ran around the House and between Safa and
Marwa in order to show the idolaters his strength."
<P>
'Amr said, "I heard the like of it from 'Ata' from Ibn 'Abbas."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXX: Menstruating women fulfilling all the rites except <I>tawaf</I>
of the House. Doing <I>sa'y </I>between Safa and Marwa while not in
<I>wudu'</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#233">1567</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I arrived
in Makka when I was menstruating and did do not <I>tawaf</I> of the House
nor go between Safa and Marwa." She said, "I complained about that to the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said,
"Do everything other pilgrims do, except do not do <I>tawaf</I> of the House
until you are pure."
<P>
1568. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and his Companions went into <I>ihram</I>
for hajj and none of them, except the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace,and Talha, had sacrifices with them. 'Ali arrived from the Yemen
with a sacrificial animal and said, 'I have gone into <I>ihram</I> with the
same intention as that for which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, went into <I>ihram</I>.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, commanded his Companions to make it an <I>'umra </I>and
do <I>tawaf</I> and then to cut their hair short and to come out of
<I>ihram</I> - except for those who had sacrificial animals with them. They
said, 'How can we go to Mina when one of us says he has just had a seminal
discharge?' That reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said, 'If I had known at the start of this affair what I know at the
end, I would not have brought a sacrificial animal with me. If I did not
have a sacrificial animal with me, I would have come out of <I>ihram</I>.'
'A'isha got her menstrual period and performed all the rites except for
<I>tawaf</I> of the House. When she was pure, she did <I>tawaf</I> of the
House and said, 'Messenger of Allah, you are all returning with hajj and<I>
'umra </I>and I am returning with only hajj.' So he commanded 'Abdu'r-Rahman
ibn Abi Bakr to go out with her to at-Tan'im and she performed<I> 'umra
</I>after hajj.
<P>
1569. It is related from Ayyub that Hafsa said, "We used to keep our young
women from going out for the two <I>'Ids</I>. A woman came and stayed at
the fortress of the Banu Khalaf and she related that her sister, whose husband
had been one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and had been on twelve expeditions with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and who had herself gone with him
on six of them, said, 'We used to treat the wounded and care for the sick.'
'My sister asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, "Is there any harm in one of us going out if she does not have an
outer covering garment?" He said, "Her companion should let her share her
outer covering garment and take part in the good actions and gatherings of
the believers." When Umm 'Atiyya came, I asked her (or he said, "We asked
her"), and she never mentioned the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, without saying, 'By my father', and we said, "Did you
hear the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say
such-and-such?" and she said, "Yes, by my father! I heard the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Young unmarried women, women who
seclude themselves - or young girls who seclude themselves - and menstruating
women also should go out and take part in the good actions and meetings of
the believers, but menstruating women should stay away from the place of
prayer.' " ' "
<P>
[Hafsa said,] "I said, 'Menstruating women?' She said, 'Do they not attend
'Arafa, and so on and so on.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXI: Going into <I>ihram</I> from al-Batha' and elsewhere for Makkans
and other pilgrims when leaving Mina.</B>
<P>
'Ata' was asked about whether someone in the area (of Makka) can say
<I>talbiya</I> for the hajj. He said, "Ibn 'Umar used to say <I>talbiya</I>
on the Day of Tarwiya after he had prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> and was upright on
his mount. Jabir said, "We arrived with the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and came out of <I>ihram</I> until the Day of Tarwiya
when we put Makka behind us and said <I>talbiya</I> for the hajj." Jabir
said, "We went into <I>ihram</I> from al-Batha'."
<P>
'Ubayd ibn Jurayj said to Ibn 'Umar, "I see that when you are in Makka, whereas
other people go into <I>ihram</I> when they see the new moon, you do not
go into <I>ihram</I> until the Day of Tarwiya." He said, "I did not see the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, go into <I>ihram</I> until
his mount set off."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXII: Where to pray <I>Dhuhr</I> on the Day of Tarwiya</B>
<P>
1570. It is related that 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn Rufay' said, "I asked Anas ibn
Malik saying, 'Tell me something you remember from the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Where did he pray <I>Dhuhr</I> and
<I>'Asr </I>on the Day of Tarwiya?' He said, 'At Mina.' I said, 'Where did
he pray <I>'Asr </I>on the Day of Nafr [13th Dhu'l-Hijja]?' He said, 'At
al-Abtah.' Then he said, 'Do as your amirs do.'"
<P>
[al-Abtah is al-Muhassab]
<P>
1571. It is related that 'Abdu'l-'Aziz said, "I went out to Mina on the Day
of <I>Tarwiya</I> and met Anas riding on a donkey. I asked, 'Where did the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray <I>Dhuhr</I> on this
day?' He replied, 'See where your amirs pray and pray there.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXIII: The prayer at Mina</B>
<P>
1572. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> at Mina
as did Abu Bakr, and 'Umar, and 'Uthman at the beginning of his khalifate."
<P>
1573. It is related that Haritha ibn Wahb al-Khuza'i said, "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led us in a two <I>rak'at </I>prayer
at Mina when we were the most numerous we had ever been and the most secure."
<P>
1574. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "I prayed two rak'ats with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and two rak'ats with Abu Bakr and
two rak'ats with 'Umar, and then you followed different paths [i.e. you disagreed
about shortening the prayer or praying it in full]. Would that I were lucky
enough to have two rak'ats of the four accepted!"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXIV: Fasting on the Day of 'Arafa</B>
<P>
1575. It is related from Umm al-Fadl, "The people were unsure about whether
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was fasting on the
day of 'Arafa. I sent something to drink to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and he drank it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXV: The <I>talbiya</I> and <I>takbir</I> when going from Mina to
'Arafa</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#43">1576</A>. It is related that Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
ath-Thaqafi asked Anas ibn Malik while they were going from Mina to 'Arafa,
"What did you do on this day with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace?" He said, "Some of us used to say the <I>talbiya</I>
and no one objected to it, and some of us said the <I>takbir</I> and no one
objected to it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXVI: Going at noon on the Day of 'Arafa</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#203">1577</A>. It is related that Salim said, "'Abdu'l-Malik
wrote to al-Hajjaj telling him not to differ from Ibn 'Umar in the matter
of the hajj. I was with Ibn 'Umar when he came on the day of 'Arafa when
the sun had just started to decline and shouted near the tent of al-Hajjaj.
He came out wearing a large waist-wrapper dyed with safflower and said, 'What
do you want, Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman?' He said, 'Leave now if you want to fulfill
the <I>sunna</I>?' He said. 'Right now?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Give me
a minute to pour some water on my head and then I will come.' He dismounted
until al-Hajjaj came out. He went between me and my father and I said, 'If
you want to fulfill the <I>sunna</I>, then give a short <I>khutba</I> and
go quickly for the Standing. He began to look towards 'Abdullah and when
'Abdullah saw that, he said, 'He has spoken the truth.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXVII: Remaining on one's mount while at 'Arafa</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#133">1578</A>. It is related from Umm al-Fadl bint al-Harith
that on the day of 'Arafa some people disagreed in her presence about whether
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was fasting or not.
Some of them said, "He is fasting," and others said, "He is not fasting."
[She said,] "He was mounted on his camel and I sent him a bowl of milk and
he drank it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXVIII: Combining the two prayers at 'Arafa</B>
<P>
When Ibn 'Umar missed the prayer with the Imam, he combined the prayers.
<P>
1579. Ibn Shihab said, "Salim informed me that in the year that al-Hajjaj
ibn Yusuf attacked Ibn az-Zubayr, he asked 'Abdullah, 'What do you do during
the Standing on the day of 'Arafa?' Salim said, 'If you want to fulfil the
<I>sunna</I>, do the prayer at midday on the day of 'Arafa.' 'Abdullah ibn
'Umar said, 'He has spoken the truth.' The <I>Sunna</I> was to combine
<I>Dhuhr</I> and <I>'Asr</I>. I said to Salim, 'Did the Messenger of Allah*
do that?' Salim said, 'By doing it do you think you are doing anything except
following his sunna?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXIX: Making the <I>khutba</I> at 'Arafa short </B>
<P>
1580. It is related that Salim said, "'Abdu'l-Malik wrote to al-Hajjaj to
follow Ibn 'Umar in the matter of the the hajj. I was with Ibn 'Umar when
he came on the day of 'Arafa when the sun had started to decline - or go
down - and shouted at his tent. 'Where is he?' He came out to him and Ibn
'Umar said, 'Leave now!' He said. 'Right now?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Give
me a minute to pour some water over myself.' Ibn 'Umar dismounted until he
came out. He went between me and my father and I said, 'If you want to fulfil
the <I>sunna</I>, then give a short <I>khutba</I> and go quickly for the
Standing. Ibn 'Umar said, 'He has spoken the truth.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XC: The Standing at 'Arafa</B>
<P>
1581. It is related from Muhammad ibn Jubayr ibn Mut'im that his father said,
"I was looking for a camel of mine..."
<P>
It is related that Jubayr ibn Mut'im said, "I lost a camel and went to look
for it on the day of 'Arafa and saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, standing at 'Arafa and I said, 'By Allah, this man is from
al-Hums [i.e. Quraysh]. What is he doing here?'"
<P>
1582. It is related that 'Urwa said, "In the time of <I>Jahiliyya</I>, people
used to do <I>tawaf</I> naked except for al-Hums. Al-Hums consisted of Quraysh
and their descendants. The Hums used to give to other people, the men giving
clothes to other men who would then do <I>tawaf</I> in them, and the women
giving clothes to other women who would then do <I>tawaf</I> in them. Those
to whom the Hums did not give any clothes would do <I>tawaf</I> of the House
naked. Most people used to disperse from 'Arafa, but the Hums would disperse
from Muzdalifa."
<P>
He said, "My father informed me from 'A'isha that this <I>ayat</I> was sent
down about al-Hums, <I>'Then press on from where the people press on.'</I>
(2:199)" He said, "They used to disperse from Muzdalifa and were sent to
'Arafa."
<P>
<P>
<B>XCI: The way to proceed when leaving 'Arafa</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#185">1583</A>. It is related that 'Urwa said, "Once while
I was present, Usama was asked, 'How did the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, proceed in the Farewell Hajj when he left
'Arafa?' He replied, 'He travelled at a medium pace and when he found a gap,
he would go faster.'"
<P>
Hisham said, "<I>Nass</I> is faster than medium pace; <I>fajwa</I> is space
and its plural is <I>fajawat</I> and <I>fija'</I>, like <I>rakwa</I> and<I>
rika'</I>. <I>Manas</I> is that in which there is no time to escape." (cf
Qur'an 38:3)
<P>
<P>
<B>XCII: Dismounting between 'Arafa and Muzdalifa</B>
<P>
1584. It is related from Usama ibn Zayd, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
asked and grant him peace, came down from 'Arafa, he went over to a gulley
and relieved himself and&nbsp;then did <I>wudu'</I>. I said, 'Messenger of
Allah, are you going to pray?' He replied, 'The prayer is still ahead of
you.'"
<P>
1585. It is related that Nafi' said, "Ibn 'Umar used to combine
<I>Maghrib</I> and <I>'Isha'</I> at Muzdalifa. However, he would go by the
gulley the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
gone to and would relieve himself and do <I>wudu' </I>there, not praying
until he prayed at Muzdalifa.'"
<P>
1586. It is related that Usama ibn Zayd said, "I was riding behind the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from 'Arafat. When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to the
gulley on the left before Muzdalifa, he made his camel kneel and urinated.
Then he came and I poured water for his <I>wudu'</I>. He did <I>wudu' </I>but
not thoroughly. I said, 'The prayer, Messenger of Allah!' He said, 'The prayer
is still ahead of you.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, rode on and when he reached Muzdalifa, he prayed. Then al-Fadl
rode behind the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
on the morning of Muzdalifa."
<P>
It is related from al-Fadl that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, did not stop saying the <I>talbiya</I> until reached
the <I>Jamra</I> [al-'Aqaba].
<P>
<P>
<B>XCIII: The Prophet's command to be calm in dispersing and his making a
motion at them with his whip</B>
<P>
1587. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that he went with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of 'Arafa and the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, heard a great shouting and beating of
camels behind him. He pointed with his whip at them and said, 'People! You
must be calm. Rushing is not part of piety.'"
<P>
<I>Awda'u </I>(9:47) is "to rush", <I>Khilalakum</I> refers to gaps between
them. <I>"We made it gush amongst them" </I>(19:33) means between them.
<P>
<P>
<B>XCIV: Combining the two prayers at Muzdalifa</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#206">1588</A>. It is related that Usama ibn Zayd was heard
to say, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
pushed on from 'Arafa and dismounted at a gulley, urinated and did <I>wudu'
</I>but not thoroughly. I said to him, 'The prayer!' He said, 'The prayer
is still ahead of you.' He reached Muzdalifa and did<I> wudu'</I>, doing
it thoroughly. Then the <I>iqama</I> was given for the prayer and he prayed
<I>Maghrib</I>. Then everyone made their camels stay kneeling where they
were and the <I>iqama</I> was given and he prayed, without praying anything
between the two prayers."
<P>
<P>
<B>XCV: Someone combining two prayers and not doing any supererogratory
prayers</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#205">1589</A>. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, combined <I>Maghrib</I>
and <I>'Isha'</I> at Muzdalifa with an <I>iqama</I> for each of them and
there was no supererogatory prayer between them or after them."
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#207">1590</A>. It is related from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, combined
<I>Maghrib</I> and <I>'Isha' </I>at Muzdalifa in the Farewell Hajj.
<P>
<P>
<B>XCVI: Someone giving the <I>adhan</I> and <I>iqama</I> for each of them</B>
<P>
1591. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Yazid said, "'Abdullah went on
hajj and we came to Muzdalifa at the time of the <I>adhan</I> for <I>'Isha'
</I>or about then. He commanded a man to give the <I>adhan</I> and
<I>iqama</I>. Then he prayed <I>Maghrib</I> and prayed two <I>rak'ats</I>
after it. Then he called for his meal and ate it. Then, I think, he commanded
someone to do the <I>adhan</I> and <I>iqama</I> ['Amr said, 'As far as I
know the doubt is only from Zuhayr".] Then he prayed<I> 'Isha'</I> with two
<I>rak'ats</I>. When dawn approached, he said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to not pray any prayer at this time except
for this prayer in this place on this day.' 'Abdullah said, 'These two prayers
are moved from their proper times: the <I>Maghrib</I> prayer is after people
come to Muzdalifa and <I>Fajr is</I> when dawn approaches.' He said, 'I saw
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XCVII: Someone sending the weak members of his family ahead at night,
with them staying a short while at Muzdalifa, making supplication there and
going on from there after the moon had set</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#180">1592</A>. It is related that Salim said, "'Abdullah
ibn 'Umar used to sent the weak members of his family ahead and they would
stay at Muzdalifa for some of the night and remember Allah, the Mighty and
Exalted, as much as they could and then they would go on before the Imam
got up and left. Some of them would arrive in Mina in time for the
<I>Fajr</I> prayer and some of them would arrive after that. When they arrived,
they stoned the Jamra. Ibn 'Umar used to say, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, made an allowance for such people.'"
<P>
1593. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sent me on from Muzdalifa at night."
<P>
1594. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I was among those whom the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent on early during the night of
Muzdalifa among the weak members of his family."
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#181">1595</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah, the client
of Asma', "Asma' halted on the night of Muzdalifa and stood up to pray. She
prayed for a time and then said, 'O my son, has the moon set?' I said, 'No.'
So she prayed a while longer and then said, 'Has the moon set?' I said, 'Yes.'
She said, 'Let's set out.' So we set out and continued until she had stoned
the Jamra. Then she returned and prayed <I>Subh</I> in her residence. I said
to her, 'O you! I think we have come too early.' She said, 'O my son, the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, permitted it
to the women.'"
<P>
1596. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Sawda asked the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, for permission to leave during the night of
Muzdalifa. She was a heavy and slow woman. He gave her permission."
<P>
1597. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We alighted at Muzdalifa and Sawda
asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for permission
to go on before the main body of the people. She was a slow woman. He gave
her permission and she went before the main body of the people. We stayed
on until morning and then went when he went. If only I had asked permission
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as Sawda
had done that would have been dearer to me than any other joy."
<P>
<P>
<B>XCVIII: The time <I>Fajr</I> is prayed at Muzdalifa</B>
<P>
1598. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "I never saw the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, pray a prayer outside of its time except for
two - he joined <I>Maghrib</I> and <I>'Isha' </I>and prayed <I>Fajr</I> before
its time."
<P>
1599. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Yazid said, "I went with 'Abdullah
to Makka. When we joined the prayers, he prayed two prayers, each with an
<I>adhan</I> and <I>iqama</I> with a meal between them. Then he prayed Fajr
when dawn approached. Some said, 'Dawn has arrived,' and others said, 'Dawn
has not yet arrived.' He said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "These two prayers are moved from their proper
times in this place: <I>Maghrib</I> an<I>d 'Isha'</I> - people do not arrive
at Muzdalifa until late evening - and the <I>Fajr</I> prayer at this hour."'
Then 'Abdullah stayed until it became brighter. Then he said, 'If the Amir
al-Mu'minin left now, he would be following the Sunna.' I do not know which
came first - his words or the departure of 'Uthman. He continued to say the
<I>talbiya</I> until he stoned the Jamra al-'Aqaba on the Day of Sacrifice."
<P>
<P>
<B>XCIX: The time to leave Muzdalifa</B>
<P>
1600. It is related that 'Amr ibn Maymun said, "I saw 'Umar pray <I>Subh</I>
at Muzdalifa. Then he stood and said, 'The idolaters used to not leave until
the sun rose saying, "Let it shine on Thabir." The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, acted differently from them, leaving before the
sun had risen.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>C: <I>Talbiya</I> and <I>takbir</I> on the morning of the Day of Sacrifice
until the Jamra has been stoned, and riding behind someone on the journey</B>
<P>
1601. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, let al-Fadl ride behind him. Al-Fadl reported that he
continued to say the <I>talbiya</I> until he stoned the Jamra.
<P>
1602. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Usama ibn Zayd rode behind the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from 'Arafa to Muzdalifa.
Then al-Fadl rode behind him from Muzdalifa to Mina. Both of them said, 'The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, continued to say the
<I>talbiya</I> until he stoned the Jamra.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CI: Someone performing both 'umra and hajj. <I>"Anyone who comes out of
ihram between 'umra and hajj should make whatever sacrifice is feasible.
For any one who cannot, there is three days' fast on hajj and seven on your
return &#150; that is ten in all. That is for anyone whose family does not
live near the Sacred Mosque." </I>(2:196)</B>
<P>
1603. It is related that Abu Jamra said, "I asked Ibn 'Abbas abou<I>t tamattu'
</I>and he told me to do it. I asked him about sacrificial animals and he
said, 'It can be a camel, a cow, a sheep or sharing in the blood (of an
animal).'" He went on, "It seemed that some people were not happy with this.
I went to sleep and had a dream in which a man was announcing, 'An accepted
hajj and an accepted<I> mut'a</I> (<I>tamattu'</I>).' I went to Ibn 'Abbas
and told him and he said, 'Allah is greater! The sunna of Abu'l-Qasim, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace.'" Shu'ba related, "An accepted hajj
and an accepted 'umra."
<P>
<P>
<B>CII: Riding sacrificial camels with reference to His words, "<I>We have
appointed the sacrificial animals for you as one of the sacred rites of Allah.
There is good in them for you, so mention Allah's name over them, standing
in rows. And then when they collapse on their sides, [eat of them and feed
both those who ask and those who are too shy to ask. In this way We have
made them subservient to you so that perhaps you may be thankful. Their flesh
and blood does not reach Allah but your fear of Him does reach Him. In this
way He has subjected them to you so that you might proclaim Allah's greatness
for the way that He has guided you.] Give good news to the good-doers."
</I>(22:36-27)</B>
<P>
Mujahid said, "<I>Budn</I> (camels) are called that because of their fat
(<I>budn</I>). <I>Al-qani' </I>means "beggar". <I>Al-mu'tarr </I>is someone
who seeks some of the sacrifice, be he rich or poor. The expression, <I>'the
sacred rites of Allah'</I>, is used to exalt and approve of the sacrificial
camels. <I>'Atiq </I>(Ancient, free) is because it is free of tyrants. It
is said that <I>wajabat</I> means "to fall to the earth". one says, 'The
sun went down (<I>wajabat</I>).'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#140">1604</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw a man driving a
sacrificial camel and said, 'Ride it.' He said, 'It is a sacrificial camel.'
He said, 'Ride it.' He said, 'It is a sacrificial camel.' He said, 'Ride
it, confound you! (the second or third time)'"
<P>
1605. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, saw a man driving a sacrificial camel and said, "Ride it." He
said, "It is a sacrificial camel." He said, "Ride it." He said, "It is a
sacrificial camel." He said, "Ride it" three times.
<P>
<P>
<B>CIII: Someone driving sacrifical camels with him</B>
<P>
1606. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, performed <I>tamattu' </I>in the Farewell
Hajj, joining <I>'umra t</I>o hajj. He sacrificed and drove a sacrifice with
him from Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, began by going into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>and then went
into <I>ihram</I> for the hajj. The people did <I>tamattu' </I>between <I>'umra
</I>and hajj with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Some
people brought sacrificial animals and drove them with them and some did
not sacrifice. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
came to Makka, he said to the people, 'Those of you who have a sacrifice
should not come out of <I>ihram</I> at all until after finishing their hajj.
Anyone who does not have a sacrifice should do <I>tawaf</I> of the House
and of Safa and Marwa and then cut his hair and come out of <I>ihram</I>
and then he should go into <I>ihram</I> for the hajj. Whoever cannot find
a sacrifice should fast three days on hajj and seven when he returns to his
people.' When he arrived in Makka he did <I>tawaf</I>, starting by touching
the Corner. He went fast for three circuits and walked normally for four
circuits. When he finished his <I>tawaf</I> of the House, he prayed two
<I>rak'ats</I> at the Maqam and then said the <I>taslim</I>. and went to
Safa and did <I>tawaf</I> of Safa and Marwa seven times. He did not come
out of <I>ihram</I> at all until he had finished his hajj and sacrificed
his sacrificial animal. Then he went and did <I>tawaf</I> of the House. Then
everything that was forbidden by <I>ihram</I> became lawful. Those people
who had sacrifices and drove the sacrifices with them did the same as the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did."
<P>
It is related from 'Urwa that 'A'isha told him about the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, doing <I>tamattu' </I>between <I>'umra </I>and
hajj similar to what Salim reported from Ibn 'Umar from the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>CIV: Someone buying a sacrificial animal on the way</B>
<P>
1607. It is related from Nafi' that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said
to his father, "Stay put. I am not at all sure that you will not be barred
from reaching the House." He said, "I will do as the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did. Allah said, <I>'You have a
good model in the Messenger of Allah</I>. I testify to you that I have gone
into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>." So he went into <I>ihram</I> for
<I>'umra</I>.
<P>
Nafi' said, "He went out until he came to al-Bayda' and said, "The business
of the hajj and the <I>'umra </I>is the same." He purchased a sacrificial
animal at Qudayd. Then he came and did one tawaf for both of them. He did
not come out of <I>ihram</I> until he came out of it for both of them together."

al-Hudaybiyya, he garlanded it and marked it at Dhu'l-Hulayfa, stabbing the
right side of its hump with a large knife and then making it kneel facing
the <I>qibla</I>.
<P>
1608. It is related that Al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and Marwan said, "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out from Madina with about
a thousand of his Companions until they came to Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, garlanded his sacrificial animal
and marked it and went into <I>ihram</I> for<I> 'umra</I>."
<P>
1609. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I plaited the garlands for the
sacrificial animals of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

camels so I will not come out of <I>ihram</I> until I have sacrificed.'"
<P>
1611. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to bring sacrificial animals from Madina
and I plaited the garlands for his sacrificial animals with my own hands.

away from."

<P>
1612. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I plaited the garlands for the
sacrificial animals of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
Then he marked them and garlanded them and sent them to the House, but he
stayed in Madina. Nothing was unlawful for him which would normally be lawful
for him."
<P>
<P>
<B>CVIII: Someone putting on garlands with his own hand</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#52">1613</A>. It is related from 'Amra bint 'Abdu'r-Rahman
that Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan wrote to 'A'isha that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said,
"When someone sends a sacrifice, what is unlawful for the pilgrim is also
unlawful for him until his sacrifice is sacrificed." 'Amra said, "'A'isha
said, "It is not as Ibn 'Abbas said, I plaited the garlands for the sacrificial
animals of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
with my own hands. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, garlanded them and sent them with my father. Nothing was unlawful
for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which
Allah made lawful during the time until the sacrifice was slaughtered."
<P>

<P>
<B>CXII: The covering cloths of the sacrificial camels</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar used to tear open only the place on the cloths where the hump was.
When he sacrificed them, he would remove their cloths fearing the blood would
ruin them and then he would give them away as <I>sadaqa</I>.
<P>
1621. It is related that 'Ali said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, ordered me to give away in <I>sadaqa</I> the coverings
and skins of the camels which had been sacrificed."

on hajj in the year of the Hajj of al-Haruriyya* in the time of Ibn az-Zubayr.
He was told, 'There may well be fighting between the people and we are afraid
that they will bar your way.' He said, '<I>"You have a good model in the
Messenger of Allah." </I>I will do as he did. I testify to you that I have
gone into <I>ihram</I> to perform<I> 'umra</I>.' When he was at al-Bayda'
he stated, 'The business of the hajj and the <I>'umra </I>is the same. I
testify to you that I have joined hajj with<I> 'umra</I>.' He drove a garlanded
sacrificial animal which he had purchased. When he arrived, he did
<I>tawaf</I> of the House and Safa and did not do more than that and did
not make lawful for himself any of the things which were unlawful until the
Day of Sacrifice. He shaved (his head) and sacrificed and considered that
he had completed his <I>tawaf</I> for both hajj and<I> 'umra</I> with his
first <I>tawaf</I>. Then he said, 'That is how the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, did it.'"
<P>
[The Kharijites. Harura' is a town near Kufa which was the Kharijite base.
In 68/688, there were four distinct groups who performed hajj, each separate

come to you on foot and on all sorts of lean animals, coming by every distant
road so that they can be present at what will profit them and mention Allah's
name on particular days over livestock He has provided for them. Eat of them
and feed those who are poor and in need. Then they should end their state
of self-neglect and fufill their vows and circle the Ancient House.' That

may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said, 'You have done well. Go
and do <I>tawaf</I> of the House and Safa and Marwa.' Then I went to one
of the women of the Banu Qays and she deloused my head. Then later I went
into <I>ihram</I> for hajj. I used to convey this judgement to people until
the khalifate of 'Umar. I mentioned it to him and he said, 'If we take the
Book of Allah, it commands us to complete [hajj and <I>'umra</I>]. If we
