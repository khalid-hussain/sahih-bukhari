<B><BIG><A NAME="agri">Chapter 44. Book of Agriculture and
Sharecropping</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: The excellence of sowing and planting when people eat what comes from
it by the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Have you thought about what you cultivate?
Is it you who make it germinate or are We the Germinator? If We willed We
could have made it broken stubble." </I>(56:63-65)</B>
<P>
2195. It is related that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no Muslim who plants a tree
or sows a crop from which birds, man or beasts eat but that it is
<I>sadaqa</I> for him."
<P>
It is related from Anas from the Prophet.
<P>
<P>
<B>II: What one has to be careful about in respect of the consequences of
using agricultural tools, or exceeding the limits which have been ordained.</B>
<P>
2196. It is related that Abu Umama al-Bahili said when he saw a plowshare
and some agricultural tools, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, say, 'There is no people's house which these things enter
without Allah making humiliation enter it as well.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Keeping a dog for agricultural purposes</B>
<P>
2197. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone keeps a dog, a qirat
is deducted from his actions every day - except for a farm dog or a dog used
for livestock."
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, "except for a dog used for sheep or the farm or hunting."
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, "a hunting dog or one for livestock."
<P>
2198. It is related from as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid that he heard Sufyan ibn Abi
Zuhayr, a man from Azd Shanu'a and one of the Companions of the Prophet say,
"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
say, 'If anyone keeps a dog which does not help him either with farming or
livestock, a qirat is deducted from his actions every day.'" As-Sa'ib said,
"I asked, 'You heard this from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace?' He said, 'Yes, by the Lord of this mosque.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Using cattle for ploughing</B>
<P>
2199. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Once when a man was riding a cow, it turned to
him and said, 'I was not created for this. I was created for ploughing.'"
The Prophet said, "I, Abu Bakr and 'Umar all believe it. A wolf seized a
sheep and the shepherd followed it. The wolf said, 'Who will look after it
on the day that wild beasts reign supreme, when they will have no shepherd
but me?'" He said, "I, Abu Bakr and 'Umar believe it." Abu Salama said, "On
that day, the two of them were not among the people present."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: When someone says, "Look after my date-palms or other crops and share
their fruit with me."</B>
<P>
2200. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Ansar said to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Divide the date-palms between us
and our brothers.' He said, 'No.' They [the Muhajirun] said, 'Look after
them and we will share the fruit with you.' They said, 'We hear and obey.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Cutting down trees and date-palms</B>
<P>
Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded
date-palms to be cut down and they were."
<P>
2201. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, burned the date-palms of the Banu'n-Nadir and cut them
down at al-Buwayra. Hassan said about it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The leaders of Banu Lu'ayy found it easy
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to watch the fire spreading at al-Buwayra."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2202. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij was heard to say, "We had more
farms than anyone else in Madina. We used to rent out the land in return
for the produce of a section of it which was allocated to the owner of the
land." He said, "Sometimes that section would be blighted and the the rest
of the land sound and sometimes the rest of the land would be blighted and
that section sound, so we were forbidden to do it. As for gold and silver,
they were not used at that time."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Sharecropping for half the yield and the like</B>
<P>
It is related that Abu Ja'far said, "Every family of Muhajirun in Madina
used to work the land for a third or a quarter of the produce. 'Ali, Sa'd
ibn Malik, 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, al-Qasim, 'Urwa,
the family of Abu Bakr, the family of 'Umar, the family of 'Ali and Ibn Sirin
all practised sharecropping."
<P>
'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Aswad said, "I used to share with 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn
Yazid in the crop. 'Umar used to arrange with the people that if he provided
the seeds himself, he would receive half, but if they provided the seeds,
they would receive such and such an amount."
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm, if the land belongs to one of them but
the outlay is on both of them, in their dividing the produce between the
two of them." Az-Zuhri thought that too. Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm
in picking cotton in return for half the crop." Ibrahim, Ibn Sirin, 'Ata',
al-Hakam, az-Zuhri and Qatada said, "There is no harm in letting [the weaver]
have a third or a quarter or some such amount of the cloth [he weaves]."
Ma'mar said, "There is no harm in hiring animals for a fixed term in return
for a third or a quarter [of what they carry]."
<P>
2203. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, employed the Jews of Khaybar to work the land
in return for half of its produce of fruit or other crops. He used to give
his wives a hundred <I>wasqs</I> each, eighty <I>wasqs</I> of dates and twenty
<I>wasqs</I> of barley. When 'Umar divided up Khaybar, he gave the wives
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a choice between
a grant of water and land or continuing as before. Some chose the land and
some chose the <I>wasqs</I>. 'A'isha chose the land.
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: When the number of years of sharecropping is not stipulated</B>
<P>
2204. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, employed the Jews of Khaybar for half of its produce
of fruits or other crops."
<P>
2205. It is related that 'Amr said, "I said to Tawus, 'I wish you would give
up sharecropping since they claim that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, forbade it.' He said, ''Amr! I give them land and help them.
The most knowledgeable of them, i.e. Ibn 'Abbas, told me that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not forbid it, but said, "It
is better for one of you to give land to his brother than to take a fixed
rent for it."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Sharecropping with the Jews</B>
<P>
2206. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, gave Khaybar to the Jews to work and cultivate
in return for half of what it produced.
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Disliked conditions in respect of sharecropping</B>
<P>
2207. It is related that Rafi' said, "We had more fields than anyone else
in Madina and one of us would rent out his land and say, 'This piece is mine
and that is yours.' Sometimes one would produce and the other would not.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade people to do
that."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: When someone cultivates using people's money without their permission
and it results in profit for them</B>
<P>
2208. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Once three people were out walking.
They were caught by the rain and took shelter in a mountain cave. A rock
from the mountain fell down in front of the mouth of their cave and trapped
them inside. They said to one another, 'See what right actions you have done
for the sake of Allah and supplicate Allah by them so that hopefully He will
let us out of here.' One of them said, 'O Allah, I have two aged parents
and I also have young children. I used to graze the animals for them. When
I returned to them, I would milk and give my parents milk first before my
children. One day I was delayed and did not return until evening, finding
them asleep. I milked as I normally did and stood at their heads, not wanting
to wake them up nor to give the children milk either, even though the children
were crying at my feet until dawn broke. If you know that I did that out
of the desire for Your pleasure, then make an opening for us through which
we can see the sky!' Allah made an opening and they saw the sky.' Another
said, 'O Allah, I had a niece whom I loved with the strongest love with which
a man can love a woman. I tried to seduce her and she refused me unless I
brought her a hundred dinars. I wanted to have intercourse with her. When
I was between her legs, she said, "Slave of Allah! Fear Allah and do not
deflower without marriage," so I got up. If you know that I did that out
of the desire for Your pleasure, then make an opening for us!' and it opened
further. The third said, 'O Allah, I hired a worker for a faraq of rice.
When he finished his work, he said, 'Give me my due.' I offered it to him
but he refused it. I continued to sow it until I had cows and a cowherd from
it. He came to me and said, "Fear Allah." I said, "Go to those cattle and
the cowherd and take them." He said, "Fear Allah and do not mock me." I said,
"I am not mocking you, take them." He took them. If you know that I did that
out of the desire for Your pleasure, then make an opening for us!' and it
opened the rest of the way and Allah set them free."
<P>
It is related from Nafi' that he said <I>"sa'aytu" </I>(rather than
"<I>baghaytu</I>".)
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: The <I>awqaf</I> of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and <I>kharaj</I> land, their sharecropping and
other arrangements</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to 'Umar, "Make
a <I>sadaqa</I> of the entirety of these [trees] which will not then be able
to be sold. However their fruits can be sold and given as <I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
2209. It is related that 'Umar said, "If it were not for future Muslims,
I would have divided up every village I conquered among those who took it
as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, divided up Khaybar."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Someone bringing barren land to life</B>
<P>
'Ali thought that that also applied to the devastated land in Kufa.
<P>
'Umar said, "If anyone brings barren land to life, it belongs to him." It
is related from 'Umar and Ibn 'Awf that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "provided it does not rightfully belong to another
Muslim. A man does not have any right to what he plants in it wrongfully."
<P>
It is related from Jabir from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
2210. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Anyone cultivating land which does not belong to
anyone else has the most right to it."
<P>
'Urwa said, "'Umar gave that decision during his khalifate."
<P>
2211. It is related from 'Umar &#163; that when the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was in his resting-place in Dhu'l-Hulayfa at the
bottom of the valley, he dreamt that he was told, "You are in a blessed valley."
<P>
Musa said, "Salim made our camels kneel at the place where 'Abdullah made
his kneel, seeking the resting-place of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. It was below the mosque which is in the bottom
of the valley, halfway between it and the road."
<P>
2212. It is related from 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Tonight someone came to me from my Lord (when he
was at al-'Aqiq) to pray in this blessed valley and say, ''Umra with the
hajj."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: When the owner of the land says, "I will let you remain as long as
Allah lets you remain" without mentioning a specific term, the arrangement
continues as long as both parties are in agreement</B>
<P>
2213. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace ..."
<P>
It is related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab expelled the Jews
and Christians from the land of the Hijaz. When the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, conquered Khaybar, he wanted to oust
the Jews from it. When he conquered it, the land was for Allah and His Messenger,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Muslims. He wanted to oust
the Jews from it but the Jews asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, to let them remain there and they would work the
land and take half of the produce. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to them, "We will let you remain under that
arrangement as long as we wish," and they remained there until 'Umar expelled
them to Tayma' and Ariha'.
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: The Companions of the Prophet used to share crops and fruits</B>
<P>
2214. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij related that his uncle, Zuhayr
ibn Rafi' said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, forbade us something which made things easy for us." Rafi' said, "I
said, 'What the Messenger of Allah*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said was true.' He said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, called me and said, 'What do you do with your fields?' I
said. 'We rent them out in return for what grows by the river or for some
<I>wasqs</I> of dates and barley.' He said, 'Do not do that. Cultivate them
yourselves, or have them cultivated, or keep them.'" Rafi' said, "I said,
'We hear and obey.'"
<P>
2215. It is related that Jabir said, "They used to cultivate land for a third
or a quarter or a half. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Anyone who has land should cultivate it, or give away the use of it
(for nothing). If he does not do that, he should simply let his land lie
fallow.'"
<P>
2216. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah*, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who has land should cultivate
it, or give away the use of it to his brother (for nothing). If he refuses
to do that, he should simply let his land lie fallow.'"
<P>
2217. It is related that 'Amr said, "I mentioned it to Tawus and he said,
'It is rented out for cultivation.'" Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, did not forbid it, but he said, 'It is better
for one of you to give it to his brother than to take a stipulated fee for
it.'"
<P>
2218. It is related from Nafi', "Ibn 'Umar used to rent out his fields in
the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Abu Bakr,
'Umar, 'Uthman and at the beginning of the rule of Mu'awiya. Then he was
told of the narration from Rafi' ibn Khadij that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, forbade renting out fields. Ibn 'Umar went to Rafi'
and I went with him. He asked him and he said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, forbade renting out fields.' Ibn 'Umar said, 'You
know that we used to rent out our fields in the time of the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in return for what was on
the river banks and some figs.'"
<P>
2219. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I know that in the time
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, land was rented
out." Then 'Abdullah was afraid that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, had related something about it which he did not know, so
he stopped renting out land."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Renting land for gold and silver</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "The best thing you can do is to rent uncultivated land
on a yearly basis."
<P>
2220. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij said, "My two uncles related to
me that they used to rent out land in the time of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, in return for for what grew on the river banks
or for something stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade that." Hanzala ibn Qays said, "I asked
Rafi', 'What about renting for dinars and dirhams?' Rafi' replied, 'There
is no harm in doing it for dinars and dirhams.'" Al-Layth said, "If those
with understanding of the lawful and unlawful had looked into what was forbidden
regarding that, they would not have allowed it because of the danger inherent
in it."
<P>
2221. It is related from Abu Hurayra: "One day the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was speaking and a man of the desert was with him,
'A man of the people of the Garden asked his Lord for permission to sow.
He said to him, 'Are you not surrounded by everything you desire?' He said,
'Yes, but I like to sow.' He said, 'He sowed and his plants grew quickly
and stood straight ready for harvesting. They were as high as mountains.
Allah says, "Here you are, son of Adam! Nothing satisfies you."' The bedouin
said, 'By Allah, you will find that he is either Quraysh or an Ansari! They
are people of agriculture, and we are not people of agriculture.' The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughed."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: What has come about planting trees</B>
<P>
2222. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "We used to be happy on the
day of Jumu'a. There was a woman among us who used to pull up by the roots
the garden-beet (<I>silq</I>) which we planted by our irrigation channels
and put them in a pot. Then she would put in some barley. (I think that he
said, "There was no fat or melted fat in it.") After praying the Jumu'a prayer
we would visit her and then she would bring it to us. We used to be happy
on the day of Jumu'a because of that. We did not have lunch or an afternoon
nap except after Jumu'a."
<P>
2223. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "They say that Abu Hurayra relates
many <I>hadiths</I>. Allah is the One who will be met [on the Day of Rising!]!
They say, 'Why do the Muhajirun and Ansar not relate the same <I>hadiths</I>
as him?' My brothers among the Muhajirun used to be busy with their business
in the markets and my brothers among the Ansar were busy with their property.
I was a poor man and I would stick close to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, in order to fill my stomach and be present
with him when others were absent and remember when they forgot. One day,
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever of you
spreads his garment until I finish what I am saying and then gathers it to
his chest will never forget anything that I say.' I spread out a striped
cloak of mine which was the only garment I had until the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, finished what he was saying and then I gathered
it to my chest. By the One who sent him with the truth, I have not forgotten
anything right up until today. By Allah, if it had not been for two ayats
in the Book of Allah, I would never have related anything:<I> "Those who
conceal the Clear Signs that We have sent down..." </I>to <I>"Most Merciful."

(<I>musaqa</I>) and Water</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: Water</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"And We made from water every living thing.
So will they not believe?" </I>(21:30) and His words, may His mention be
exalted!, <I>"Have you thought about the water that you drink? Is it you
who sent it down from the clouds or are We the Sender? If We willed We could
have made it bitter. So why do you not give thanks?"</I> (56:68-70)
<P>
<P>
<B>II: On water and people who think it permitted to give water as
<I>sadaqa</I>, as a gift and as a legacy, whether divided out or not</B>
<P>
'Uthman said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"Who will buy the well of Ruma letting his own bucket in it have exactly
the same status as the bucket of any other Muslim (i.e. make it a
<I>waqf</I>)?" 'Uthman bought it.
<P>
2224. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was brought a cup and drank from it. On his right
was a boy who was the youngest of the people present while the old men were
on his left. He said, 'Boy, will you give me permission to give it to the
old men first?' He said, 'I would not let anyone else have something you
were going to give to me, Messenger of Allah,' so he gave it to him."
<P>
2225. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "I milked a domestic sheep
for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which
was in the house of Anas ibn Malik. Its milk was mixed with water from the
well in the house of Anas. He gave the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, the cup and he drank from it and then lowered it
from his mouth. Abu Bakr was on his left and a bedouin on his right. 'Umar
said, being afraid that he would give it to the bedouin, 'Give it to Abu
Bakr who is with you, Messenger of Allah.' He gave it to the bedouin who
was on his right and said, 'The right, then the right.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Someone saying, "The owner of the water has more right to it until
he has had his fill, according to the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, 'Do not withhold excess water.'"</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw13.html#29">2226</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not
withhold excess water, preventing others from pasturing from it."

bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not withhold excess water, preventing
others from obtaining extra pasturage through it."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Someone who digs a well on his own property is not liable [for injuries
resulting from the well]</B>
<P>
2228. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no bloodwit for a mine. There
is no bloodwit for a well. There is no bloodwit for a dumb animal. There
is a fifth for buried treasure."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Disputes about wells and settling them</B>
<P>
2229. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears an oath depriving someone of his
property and lies in his oath, will meet Allah and find Him angry with him."
Allah Almighty revealed<I>, "Those who sell Allah's contract and their own
oaths for a paltry price.</I>" (3:77) Al-Ash'ath came and said, "What has
Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman [i.e. 'Abdullah] related to you? This <I>ayat</I> was
sent down about me. I owned a well on the land of a cousin of mine and [the
Prophet] said to me, 'bring your witnesses.' I said, 'I do not have any
witnesses.' He said, 'Then let him take an oath.' I said, 'Messenger of Allah,
then he will take an oath,' and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, mentioned this report and Allah sent down that <I>ayat</I> to
confirm it."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The wrong action of someone who denies water to a traveller</B>
<P>
2230. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are three whom Allah will not
look at on the Day of Rising and will not purify and who will have a painful
punishment: a man who had excess water by the roadside and withheld it from
travellers; a man who gave allegiance to an Imam, only giving it for the
sake of this world, and being pleased when he was given some of it and angry
when he was not given any; and a man who put out his goods after <I>'Asr
</I>and said, 'By Allah. There is no god but He, I have already been given
such-and-such for them,' and a man believes him." Then he recited this verse,
<I>"Those who sell Allah's contract and their own oaths for a paltry price."
</I>(3:77)

<P>
<B>VII: Damming rivers</B>
<P>
2231. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr , "A man of the Ansar quarrelled
with az-Zubayr in the presence of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, about the lava-bed canals by which the palm-trees were irrigated.
The Ansari said, 'Let the water through,' and he refused. They quarrelled
in the presence of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told az-Zubayr,
'Zubayr, irrigate, and then let the water pass through to your neighbour.'
The Ansari became angry and said, 'Is it because he is your aunt's son?'
The face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
changed colour and then he said, 'Water, Zubayr, and then retain the water
until it reaches the wall.' Az-Zubayr said, 'By Allah, I think that this
ayat was revealed about that, <I>"No, by your Lord, they are not believers
until they make you their judge in the disputes that break out between
them.</I>"' (4:65)"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Watering the upper part before the lower</B>
<P>
2232. It is related that 'Urwa said, "Az-Zubayr quarrelled with a man of
the Ansar and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Zubayr, irrigate and then let it through.' The Ansari said, 'He is your
aunt's son.' He, peace be upon him, said, 'Water, Zubayr and then let the
water reach the wall and then stop.' Az-Zubayr said, 'I think that this verse
was revealed about that: <I>"No, by your Lord, they are not believers until
they make you their judge in the disputes that break out between them."</I>'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Watering the upper part to the ankles</B>
<P>
2233. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, "A man of the Ansar quarrelled
with az-Zubayr about the lava-bed canals by which the palm-trees were irrigated.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Irrigate,
Zubayr (and he commanded what was reasonable) and then let the water pass
through to your neighbour.' The Ansari said, 'Is it because he is your aunt's
son?' The face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, changed colour and then he said, 'Water, Zubayr, and then retain the
water until it reaches the wall.' So he gave him his full right. Az-Zubayr
said, By Allah, I think that this ayat was revealed about that,<I> "No, by
your Lord, they are not believers until they make you their judge in the
disputes that break out between them."</I>' (4:65)" Ibn Shihab said to me,
"The Ansar and other people thought that the words of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, 'Water and then retain the water until it
reaches the wall' meant up to the ankles."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The excellence of giving water</B>
<P>
2234. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Once a man was walking and was very
thirsty. He went down a well and drank from it. Then he came back out and
found a dog there, panting, which had been driven by thirst to eating mud.
He said, 'This dog has reached the same state as I was in.' So he filled
his leather sock and, holding it in his mouth, climbed back up and let the
dog drink Allah thanked him for that and forgave him." They said, "Messenger
of Allah, do we get a reward then on account of animals?" He said, "There
is a reward on account of every live animal [lit. everything with a moist
liver]."
<P>
It is corroborated from Muhammad ibn Ziyad.
<P>
2235. It is related from Asma' bint Abi Bakr that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, prayed the Eclipse Prayer and said, "The Fire
drew so close to me that I said, 'O Lord, am I going to be one of them?'
Suddenly there was a woman there (I think that he said a cat was mauling
her). I said, 'What is happening to her?' They said, 'She shut the cat up
until it died of hunger.'"
<P>
2236. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A woman was punished on account
of a cat which she shut up until it died of hunger. She entered the Fire
because of it." He said, "He will say - and Allah knows best, 'You did not
feed it nor give it water when you shut it up nor did you let it loose to
eat from the grass of the earth.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Someone thinking that the owner of a water basin and waterskin has
more right to what he owns</B>
<P>
2237. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought a cup and drank. On his
right was a boy who was the youngest of the people present while the old
men were on his left. He said, 'Boy, will you give me permission to give
it to the old men?' He said, 'I would not let anyone else have something
you were going to allot to me, Messenger of Allah,' so he gave it to him."
<P>
2238. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, &nbsp;said, "By the One in whose hand my soul is, I
will drive away men from my Basin just as unfamiliar camels are driven from
a watering place."
<P>
2239. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "May Allah be merciful to the mother of Isma'il!
If she had left Zamzam (or he said, 'If she had not taken handfuls of water')
it would have been a flowing fountain. Jurham came and said, 'Will you give
us permission to camp with you?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to
the water.' They said, 'Alright.'"
<P>
2240. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There are three people that Allah will not speak
to nor look at on the Day of Rising: a man who swears that he has been offered
more for his goods than he has been offered and is lying, a man who swears
a false oath after<I> 'Asr </I>in order to get the property of another Muslim
man and a man who withholds excess water. Allah will say, 'Today I will withhold
My bounty as you withheld the bounty of something that was not the work of
your hands.'"
<P>
Another <I>isnad</I> which reaches back to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: There is no <I>hima</I> (private pasturage) except that of Allah
and His Messenger</B>
<P>
<B> </B>2241. It is related that as-Sa'b ibn Jaththama said that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no
<I>hima</I> except that of Allah and His Messenger." [Ibn Shihab] said, "It
has been conveyed to us that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, made an-Naqi' a <I>hima</I> and that 'Umar made a hima at ash-Sharaf
and ar-Rabadha."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: People and animals drinking from rivers</B>
<P>
2242. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Horses are a reward for one man, and
a shelter for another man and a burden for another man. He for whom they
are a reward is a man who tethers them in the way of Allah giving them a
long tether in a pasture or meadow. He will have good deeds for everything
the horse gets from the pasture or the meadow to the full extent of its tether.
If it breaks its tether and crosses a hill or two, then he has good deeds
for its tracks and dung. If it crosses a river and drinks from it, that will
constitute good deeds for him even if he did not intend to give it water.
So there is a reward for all of that. There is also the man who tethers them
in order to be self-sufficient (from people) and to be able to refrain from
asking from them, and then he does not forget the right of Allah over their
necks (i.e. <I>zakat</I> if they are used for trade) and their backs (i.e.
not overloading them), so they constitute a shelter for him. Then there is
the man who tethers them out of boasting and showing-off and enmity towards
the people of Islam. They constitute a burden for that man." The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked about donkeys
and said, "Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this general
single verse, <I>'Whoever has done an atom's weight of good will see it and
whoever has done an atom's weight of evil will see it.'</I>" (99:7-8)
<P>
2243. It is related that Zayd ibn Khalid said, "A man came to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and asked him about finding
some lost property. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Note the details of its container and its binding and publicise it
for a year. If its owner comes, (give it to him). Otherwise, do what you
want with it.' He said, 'What about a lost sheep?' and he said, 'It is for
you, your brother or the wolf.' Then he said, 'What about a lost camel?'
and he said, 'It has nothing to do with you. It has its water and its feet
and it will find water and graze from the trees until its owner finds it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Selling wood and grass</B>
<P>
2244. It is related from az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "It is better for one of you to take
ropes and bring a bundle of firewood on his back and sell it so that Allah
gives him what he needs than for him to ask people who then give to him or
refuse to."
<P>
2245. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "It is better for one of you to take
a rope and carry firewood on his back than for him to go to a man to beg
from him who then gives to him or refuses to."
<P>
2246. It is related that 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said, "I received an old she-camel
as my share of the booty for being at the Battle of Badr with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave me another old she-camel. One
day I made both of them kneel at the door of a man of the Ansar, intending
to load them with <I>idhkhir</I> to sell. With me was a goldsmith of the
Banu Qaynuqa'. I wanted to use the proceeds for my wedding feast with Fatima.
Hamza ibn 'Abdi'l-Muttalib was drinking in that house and there was a singer
with him who said, 'O Hamza! The fat old she-camels!' Hamza went to them
with his sword and cut off their humps and opened their sides and took some
of their livers. (I said to Ibn Shihab, 'Part of their humps?' He said, 'He
cut off their humps and took them.')" Ibn Shihab said that 'Ali said, "I
looked at a sight which appalled me and I went to the Prophet of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace. Zayd ibn Haritha was with him and I
told him the news. He went out with Zayd and I went with him. He went to
Hamza and was harsh with him and Hamza looked up and said, 'Are you people
anything but the slaves of my fathers?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, backed away from them. That was before wine
was made unlawful."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Land grants</B>
<P>
2247. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, wanted to make a land grant of Bahrayn and the Ansar said,
'Not until you give the same land grant to our brothers of the Muhajirun
that you give to us.' He said, 'After I have gone you will see others being
given preference over you, so be patient until you meet me.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Written documentation of land grants</B>
<P>
2248. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, summoned the Ansar to give them a land grant in Bahrayn.
They said, 'Messenger of Allah, if you do it, write a document giving the
same to our brothers of Quraysh.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, could not do that and said, 'After I have gone you will see others
being given preference over you, so be patient until you meet me.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Milking she-camels near water</B>
<P>
2249. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Part of a camel's right is to be milked at a
place where there is water."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: A man being able to pass through or irrigate in a garden or a palm
grove</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone sells
palm-trees after they have been pollinated, the fruit belongs to the seller."
The seller is permitted to pass through and irrigate them until he cuts the
fruit. The same applies to the owner of an <I>'ariyya.</I>
<P>
<A HREF="muw11.html#s2">2250</A>. It is related from the father of Salim
ibn 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "If anyone sells palm-trees which have been pollinated,
their fruits belong to the seller unless the buyer stipulates its inclusion.
If anyone sells a slave who owns property, his property belongs to the seller
unless the buyer stipulates its inclusion."
<P>
It is related from 'Umar, "...about the slave."
<P>
2251. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, gave a dispensation for <I>'ariyyas </I>to be sold
according to an estimate of the amount of their fruit."
<P>
2252. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade the <I>mukhabara</I> and
<I>muhaqala</I> and the <I>muzabana</I> transactions and the selling of dates
before it was clear that they were sound and fruits being sold for other
than dinars and dirhams except in the <I>'ariyya </I>sale.
<P>
2253. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, &nbsp;may Allah
bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;gave a dispensation for the sale of
<I>'ariyyas</I> according to an estimate of the amount of dates in cases
where the amount was less than or equal to five <I>wasqs</I>." (Da'ud was
uncertain about that.)
<P>
2254. It is related from Rafi' ibn Khadij and Sahl ibn Abi Hathma that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the
<I>muzabana</I> sale, i.e. selling dates for dates - except for
<I>'ariyya</I> sales. He gave permission for that.
<P>
Ibn Ishaq said that Bushayr related the like of it.

<B>I: Someone who buys on credit and does not have the money to pay or does
not have it with him</B>
<P>
2255. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I went on an expedition
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'What
is wrong with your camel? Will you sell it to me?' I replied, 'Yes,' and
I sold it to him. When he reached Madina, I brought him the camel and he
gave me the price."
<P>
2256. It is related that al-A'mash said, "We mentioned pledges in connection
with the <I>salam</I> sale in the presence of Ibrahim and he said, 'Al-Aswad
related to me from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, bought some food from a Jew to be paid at a later date, and left
his iron armour with him as a pledge.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Someone taking people's property intending to repay it or destroy
it</B>
<P>
2257. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him

to repay it, Allah will repay it for him, and if someone takes it intending
to destroy it, Allah will destroy him."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Paying debts</B>
<P>
Allah Almighty says,<I> "Allah commands you to return to their owners the
things you hold on trust and, when you judge between people, to judge with
justice. How excellent is what Allah exhorts you to do! Allah is All-Hearing,
All-Seeing." </I>(4:58)
<P>
2258. It is related that Abu Dharr said, "I was with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, when he saw it (i.e. Uhud) and said, 'I would
not like to have it turned into gold for me and then have even one dinar
of it remain with me for more than three days except a dinar I might keep
for paying debts.' Then he said, 'Those who have a lot (in this world) will
have little (reward in the Next) except for someone who spends his money
here and there, (and Abu Shihab indicated in front of him, to his right and
to his left.) and they are few.' He said, 'Stay where you are,' and went
forward a little way and I heard a voice and wanted to go, but then I remembered
his words, 'Stay where you are until I come back to you.' When he came back,
I said, 'Messenger of Allah, who was that I heard? (or he said, 'What was
the voice I heard?') He said, 'Did you hear something?' I said, 'Yes.' He
said, 'Jibril, peace be upon him, came to me and said, "Any of your community
who die without associating anything with Allah will enter the Garden." I
said, "Even if he does such-and-such actions?" He said, "Yes."'"
<P>
2259. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "If I had the equivalent of Uhud in
gold, I would not be happy for three days to pass with any of it still in
my possession except for something I might keep to pay off a debt."
<P>
Salih and 'Uqayl related it from az-Zuhri.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Asking for a loan of camels</B>
<P>
2260. It is related from Abu Hurayra that a man came to ask the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to settle his debt and
spoke coarsely to him. His Companions went for him and the Messenger of Allah.
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Leave him alone. The one
with a right is allowed to speak. Buy him a camel and give it to him.' They
said, "Messenger of Allah, we can only find one which is better than the
age that this one warrants.' He said, 'Buy it and give it to him. 'The best
of you is he who is most generous in settlement.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Acting well when asking for debts to be paid</B>
<P>
2261. It is related from Hudhayfa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "A man died and was questioned. He said, 'I used to
buy and sell with people and I used to make things easy for the wealthy and
give those in difficulty time to pay,' and he was forgiven."
<P>
Abu Mas'ud said, "I heard this from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Can one give an older (camel) than the one he owes?</B>
<P>
2262. It is related from Abu Hurayra "A man came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, to ask (for a camel) he owed him. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Give it to him.'
They said, 'We can only find one which is better than the age that this one
warrants.' The man said, 'You have given me full payment. May Allah give
you full payment!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Give it to him. 'The best people are those who are most
generous in settlement.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Settling debts in a good manner</B>
<P>
2263. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, owed a man a camel of a certain age and he came
to him to ask for it. He said, 'Give it to him.' They looked for one of that
age, but only found one older. He said, 'Give it to him.' He said, 'You have
given me full payment. May Allah give you full payment!' The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The best of you is he who is
most generous in settlement.'"
<P>
2264. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I came to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was in the mosque. (Mis'ar
said, 'I think that he said, 'in the forenoon') He said, 'Pray two rak'ats.'
He owed me for a debt which he paid me, giving me extra."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: When someone pays less than is due or has his debt discharged, that
is permitted</B>
<P>
2265. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said that his father was killed
in the Battle of Uhud as a martyr while he had debts. (He said,) "The creditors
were insistent about their rights and I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and he asked them to accept the dates of my garden
and discharge my father, but they refused. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, did not give them my garden. He said, 'We will come
to you in the morning.' He came to us early in the morning and walked about
amid the palm-trees and prayed for blessing in their fruit. I cut them paid
them off and we still had some of its dates left."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: When someone settles an account (by their having an equivalent debt)
or giving dates for dates or something else without measurement or weighing</B>
<P>
2266. It is related from Wahb ibn Kaysan that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah informed
him that his father died and left a debt of thirty <I>wasqs</I> to a man
of the Jews. Jabir asked for time to pay and the man refused to give him
it, so Jabir spoke to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, to intercede with him on his behalf. The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, went and spoke to the Jew about taking
the fruit of his palm-trees in return for what he was owed, but he refused
to do so. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
then went in among the date-palms and walked about among them and then said
to Jabir, 'Cut them and give him what is due him.' So he cut them after the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had left and
he gave him a full thirty <I>wasqs</I> and had seventeen <I>wasqs</I> over.
Jabir came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
to tell him what had happened and found him praying 'Asr. When he finished,
he told him about the surplus and he said, 'Tell that to Ibn al-Khattab.'
Jabir went to 'Umar and told him and 'Umar said to him, 'I knew when the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, walked in it,
that it would be blessed."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Someone seeking refuge from debts</B>
<P>
2267. It is related that 'A'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace,used to make supplication in the prayer:
"O Allah, I seek refuge with You from wrong action and debt." Someone remarked
to him, "How often you seek refuge from debt, Messenger of Allah!" He said,
"When a man is in debt, when he speaks, he lies and when he makes a promise,
he breaks it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The prayer over someone who died leaving debts</B>
<P>
2268. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "If anyone leaves money, it is for his heirs,
but if anyone dies leaving weak dependants (or debts) it is our duty (to
take care of them)."
<P>
2269. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There is no believer but that I am closer to
him than anyone both in this world and the next. If you wish, recite, <I>'The
Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.'</I> (33:6) If
any believer dies and leaves money, it goes to whatever legal heirs he has.
But if anyone leaves a debt or a needy family, I am the one to come to. I
am his guardian."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Any delay in payment on the part of a rich person is injustice</B>
<P>
2270. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Delay in payment on the part of a rich
man is injustice."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: The person with a right can speak</B>
<P>
It is mentioned that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Any delay in payment on the part of someone who has the means opens
the way for his punishment and for damage to his reputation." Sufyan said
that "his reputation" means that his delay in payment is talked about and
"his punishment" means his imprisonment.
<P>
2271. It is related from Abu Hurayra that a man came to ask the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to pay his debts and spoke coarsely
to him. His Companions went for him and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Leave him alone. The one with a right
is allowed to speak."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: When someone finds his property with a bankrupt person to whom he
has sold it, lent it, or entrusted it, he has the greatest right to it</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "When someone is bankrupt and that is ascertained [by the
judge], he is not permitted to set slaves free nor to buy or sell."
<P>
Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said that 'Uthman judged that if someone took part
of what he was due before the person became bankrupt, that was his. If someone
recognises his goods, he has most right to them.
<P>
<A HREF="muw11.html#88">2272</A>. It is related that Abu Hurayra was heard
to say that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said - or he said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, say, 'If anyone finds any of his property with another man,
or person, who has become bankrupt, he has more right to it than other people."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Someone delaying a creditor for a day or so and not thinking that
that constituted delay in payment</B>
<P>
Jabir said, "When the creditors of my father were insistent in demanding
their rights in respect of the debts of my father, the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, asked them to accept the fruits of my garden,
but they refused. So he did not give them the fruits of the garden nor have
them picked. He said, 'I will come to you tomorrow.' He came to us in the
morning and prayed that its fruits would be blessed, and so I paid them off."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Someone selling the property of a bankrupt or poor man and then dividing
the proceeds among the creditors or giving it to him so that he could spend
it on himself</B>
<P>
<B> </B>2273. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "A man set free
a slave of his by <I>tadbir</I> (to be set free on his death) and then became
in need of money. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took
the slave and said, 'Who will buy him from me?' Nu'aym ibn 'Abdullah purchased
him and he took its price and gave it to the owner."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: When something is lent for a fixed term, or selling on credit for
a fixed term</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said that there is no harm in a loan for a fixed term, even if
someone gives more dirhams (in repayment), as long as the creditor has not
stipulated that. 'Ata' and 'Amr ibn Dinar said, "He has the loan for that
fixed term."
<P>
2274. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "He mentioned a man among the Tribe
of Israel who asked another of the Tribe of Israel to lend him something,
and he gave it to him for a fixed term." The <I>hadith</I>... (see 1427)
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Interceding to ask for a reduction in a debt</B>
<P>
2275. It is related that Jabir said, "My father died leaving children and
debts. I asked those who were owed something to reduce some of his debt,
but they refused to do so. Therefore I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and asked him to intercede with them. They still
refused. He said, 'Go and put your dates into their different categories,
the <I>'adhq ibn Zayd </I>(inferior dates) on one side, the <I>layyin</I>
on one side, and the <I>'ajwa</I> (excellent dates) on another side and then
call them together and wait until I come.' I did that and then he, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came and sat where they were. He measured
for each man until he had his full amount, and the dates still remained as
if they had not been touched at all. I was on a raid together with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, riding a camel we had which was
tired out and caused me to fall behind. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, struck it with a stick from behind and said, 'Sell it
to me and you can ride it back to Madina.' When were near, I asked his
permission, saying, 'Messenger of Allah, I am newly married.' He, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Who have you married, a virgin or someone
who has already been married?' I said, 'Someone who has already been married.
'Abdullah died leaving young daughters, so I am marrying a woman who has
been married before so that she can teach them and discipline them.' Then
he said, 'Go to your family.' I went and told my uncle about selling the
camel and he rebuked me. I told him about the slowness of the camel and what
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had done and how he
had hit it. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came,
I took the camel to him in the morning and he gave me the price of the camel,
the camel itself and my share of the booty along with everyone else."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: What is forbidden in respect of wasting wealth</B>

...</I>" (4:5) The prohibition is contained in this together with the prohibition

use it with his permission</B>
<P>
2278. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar heard the Messenger of Allah,

for those in his care. The woman is a shepherd in her husband's house and
is responsible for those in her care. The servant is a shepherd of his master's
property and is responsible for what is in his care." He said, "I heard this
from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
I think that he also said, 'A man is a shepherd of his father's property
and is responsible for what is in his care. All of you are shepherds and
each of you is responsible for his flock.'"

<B>I: What is mentioned about summoning the debtor, detaining him, and disputes
between a Muslim and a Jew</B>
<P>
2279. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "I heard a man reciting an
<I>ayat</I> when I had heard it differently from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. So I took him by the hand and brought him to the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'Both
of you act well.'" Shu'ba said, "I think that he said, 'Do not disagree.
Those before you disagreed and perished.'"
<P>
[The <I>ayat</I> was in <I>Surat ar-Rahman</I>]
<P>
2280. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Two men insulted one another
- one of the men was a Muslim and the other man was a Jew. The Muslim said,
'By the One who chose Muhammad over all the worlds,' and the Jew said, 'By
the One who chose Musa over all the worlds.' At that, the Muslim raised his
hand and slapped the Jew's face. So the Jew went to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and told him about what had happened between
him and the Muslim. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
summoned the Muslim and asked him about that and he told him. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stated, 'Do not prefer me over Musa.
On the Day of Rising, people will faint, and I will faint with them. I will
be the first to regain consciousness, and there will be Musa grasping the
Throne. I do not know whether he will be among those who fainted and came
to before me, or if he was one of those that Allah excepted.'"
<P>
2281. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "While the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was seated, a Jew came and
said, 'Abu'l-Qasim! One of your Companions has struck my face.' 'Who?' he
asked. He replied, 'A man of the Ansar.' He said, 'Summon him,' and he asked,
'Did you strike him?' He said, 'I heard him taking an oath in the market,
"By the One who chose Musa over all mankind." I said, "O base one, above
Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!" Anger took hold of me
and I struck his face.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Do not make rivalry between the Prophets. On the Day of Rising people
will faint and I will be the first from the earth splits. There will be Musa
holding to one of the legs of the Throne, and I do not know whether he will
be among those who fainted or if the first unconsciousness was enough for
him.'"
<P>
2282. It is related from Anas that a Jew crushed a girl's head between two
stones. It was said (in her presence), "Who did this to you? So-and-so?
So-and-so?" until the Jew was named. Then she indicated it was him with her
head. The Jew was seized and confessed. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, commanded that his head be crushed between two stones.

<B>II: Cancelling transactions of a fool and someone weak of intellect, even
if the ruler has not declared him legally incompetent</B>
<P>
It is reported from Jabir that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, refused the someone's <I>sadaqa</I> before he forbade him [to
give] and then he forbade him [to do the same].
<P>
Malik said, "When a man is in debt to another man and the only thing which
he has is a slave whom he then sets free, he is not permitted to set him
free. If someone sells something for someone who is weak-minded or the like
and then gives its price to him, commanding him to use it correctly and look
after it and he then spoils it, he can stop him because the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade wasting property. He said to
the one who was often duped in transactions, "When you buy, say, 'No cheating.'"
The Prophet. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not take his money.
<P>
2283. It is related that Ibn 'Umar was heard to say, "There was a man who

<P>
<P>
<B>III: Litigants arguing against one another</B>
<P>
2285. It is related that 'Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever swears an oath in which
he lies in order to take the property of a Muslim by means of it, will meet
Allah who will be angry with him." He said that al-Ash'ath said, "By Allah,
that was about me. There was some land that was shared between me and a Jewish
man, and he denied my claim, so I took him to the Prophet*. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked me, 'Do you have
a clear proof?' I answered, 'No.' He said to the Jew, 'Swear.'" He said,
"I said, 'Messenger of Allah, then he will swear and make off with my property.'
Then Allah Almighty revealed, <I>'Those who sell Allah's contract and their
own oaths for a paltry price ....' </I>(3:77)"
<P>
2286. It is related from Ka'b that he asked Ibn Abi Hadrad in the mosque
to repay a debt he owed him and they raised their voices so loud that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who was in his
house, heard them. He came out to them, raising the curtain of his room.
He called out, "Ka'b!" He said, "At your service, Messenger of Allah!" He
said, "Reduce your debt by this much," and indicated a half to me. He said,
"It is done, Messenger of Allah." He said, "Get up and pay it to him."
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#qu5">2287</A>. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
was heard to say, "I heard Hisham ibn Hakim ibn Hizam reciting <I>Surat
al-Furqan</I> in a different way to the way I recite it, and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had taught me to recite
it. I was about to hasten to remonstrate, but then I waited until he was
finished. Then I collared him with his cloak and brought him to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I heard this
person reciting differently than how you taught me to recite.' He said to
me, 'Let him go.' Then he said to him, 'Recite,' and he recited. He said,
'That is how it was revealed.' Then he said to me, 'Recite,' and I recited.
He said, 'That is how it was revealed. The Qur'an was sent down in seven
modes (<I>ahruf</I>), so recite what is easy of it.'"
<P>
<P>

Allah, my brother made a last testament to me that I should come and look
out the son of the slavegirl of Zam'a and take him (into my care). (He said,)
"He is my son."' 'Abd ibn Zam'a said, 'He is my brother the son of my father's
slavegirl. He was born on my father's bed.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, discerned a clear resemblance between the child
and 'Utba. He said, 'He is yours, 'Abd ibn Zam'a. The child belongs to the
bed. Veil yourself from him, Sawda.'"

Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent some horsemen in the direction
of Najd and they came back with a man from the Banu Hanifa called Thumama
ibn Uthal, the chief of the people of Yamama, whom they bound to one of the
pillars of the mosque. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
came out to him and said, 'What do you have, Thumama?' He said, 'Good, O
Muhammad.'" He mentioned the <I>hadith</I> and he said, "Release Thumama."

Hadrad al-Aslami. He met him and detained him and they talked until they
raised their voices. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
passed by them and called out, "Ka'b!" He indicated with his hand as if he
was saying "A half." So he took half of what he was owed and left the other
half.

<P>
2293. It is related that Khabbab said, "I used to be a blacksmith in the
<I>Jahiliyya</I> and al-'As ibn Wa'il owed me some dirhams, so I went to
him to ask for it. He said, 'I will not give it to you until you reject Muhammad,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' I said, 'By Allah, I will not reject
Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, until Allah makes you
die and then you are brought back to life.' He said, 'Leave me until I die
and am resurrected. Then I will be given wealth and children and I will pay
you.' So it was revealed,<I> 'Have you seen him who rejects Our Signs and
says, 'I will certainly be given wealth and children there.'</I>?'" (19:77)
