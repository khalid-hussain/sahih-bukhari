What has come about illness being an expiation</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Anyone who does evil will be repaid forit.."</I> (4:123)<P>5317. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that 'A'isha, the wife of theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'There is no afflictionwhich befalls a Muslim but that Allah expiates some of his wrong actionsby it, even the a thorn which pricks him.'"<P>5318. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Abu Hurayra thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "No fatigue,illness, anxiety, sorrow, harm or sadness afflicts any Muslim, even to theextent of a thorn pricking him, without Allah wiping out his mistakes byit."<P>5319. It is related from Ka'b that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "The metaphor of the believer is like a tender young plantwhich the wind sometimes bends and sometimes makes upright. The example ofthe hypocrite is like a cedar tree which remains upright until it is uprootedall at once.<P>It is related from Ka'b from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace.<P>5320. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The metaphor of a believeris like a tender young plant which bends from whichever direction the windcomes to it. When it is still, then it is upright. A believer bends withaffliction while the impious one is like the cedar tree, rigid until Allahbreaks it whenever He wishes."<P>5321. Abu'l-Hubab Sa'id ibn Yasar said, "I heard Abu Hurayra say that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'WhenAllah desires good for someone, He afflicts him.'"<P><P><B>II. Severe illness</B><P>5322. It is related by Masruq that 'A'isha said, "I did not see anyone moreseverely ill than the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace."<P>5323. Al-Harith ibn Suwayd related that 'Abdullah [ibn Mas'ud] said, "I visitedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he was ill andhe was suffering from a very high fever. I observed, 'You have a very highfever,' I added, 'Is that because you will have two rewards?' He said, 'Yes,there is no Muslim who is afflicted by harm but that Allah will make hiserrors fall away from him as the leaves of a tree fall down.'"<P><P><B>III. The people with the strongest affliction are the Prophets, then thenext best people and then the next best</B><P>5324. Al-Harith ibn Suwayd related that 'Abdullah said, "I visited the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he had a fever. Iobserved, 'Messenger of Allah, you have a very high fever!' He answered,'Yes, I have the fever of two of your men.' I asked, 'Is that because youwill have two rewards?' He said, 'Yes, it is like that. No Muslim is afflictedby harm, whether it is a thorn or something worse, without Allah expiatinghis evil deeds on that account and his sins fall away from him like leavesfall from a tree.'"<P><P><B>IV. It is mandatory to visit the sick</B><P>5325. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Feed the hungry, visit thesick and set captives free."<P>5326. It is related from Suwayd ibn Muqarrin that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said,"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, instructedus to do seven things and forbade us seven. He forbade us to wear gold rings,to wear silk, silk brocade, <I>istibraq</I> silk, <I>qissi</I> (a silk/cottonmixture), and silk saddle cloths. He commanded us to follow funerals, visitthe sick and return the greeting."<P><P><B>V. Visiting someone who is unconscious</B><P>5327. It is related that Ibn al-Munkadir heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, "Ifell ill and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and Abu Bakr came on foot to visit me. They found me unconscious. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did <I>wudu' </I>and then pouredhis wudu' water on me. I regained consciousness and the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was there. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, whatshall I do with my property? How should I settle my property?' He did givenot an answer until the Ayat of Inheritance was revealed."<P><P><B>VI. The excellence of someone who has fits</B><P>5328. 'Ata ibn Abi Rabah reported: "Ibn 'Abbas said to me, 'Shall I showa woman who is one of the people of the Garden?' 'Please do,' I answered.He said, 'This black woman came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and said, 'I have fits during which I expose myself. Pray to Allahfor me.' He said, 'If you wish, you can show fortitude and you will receivethe Garden, and if you wish, I will pray to Allah to heal you.' She said,'I will show fortitude.' She added, 'I expose myself, so pray to Allah thatI do not expose myself' and he made supplication for her.'"<P>It is related from Ibn Jurayj that 'Ata' told him that he saw that Umm Zafar,a tall black woman, at the curtain of the Ka'ba.<P><P><B>VII. The excellence of someone who has lost his sight</B><P>5329. 'Amr, the client of al-Muttalib, related that Anas ibn Malik said,"I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Allahsays, "When I test My slave regarding the two things he loves and he showsfortitude, I repay him for them with the Garden.' He meant his eyes."<P>It is corroborated by Ash'ath ibn Habir and Abu Zilal ibn Hilal from Anasfrom the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>VIII. Women and men visiting the sick</B><P>Umm ad-Darda' visited a man of the Ansar who was one of those who lived inthe mosque.<P>5330. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace,came to Madina, Abu Bakr and Bilal camedown with a fever. I visited them said, 'Father, how are you? Bilal, howare you?' When Abu Bakr's fever got worse, he would say:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  'Every man is struck down among his people in the morning.  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Death is nearer than the strap of his sandal.'</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>When the fever left Bilal, he raised his voice and said,<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  'Would that I knew whether I would spend a night in the valley of Makka  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the sweet rushes and panic grass around me!  <P>  Will I one day return to the waters of Majinna?  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will the mountains of Shama and Tafil appear to me?'"</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>'A'isha said, "I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and told him and he said, 'O Allah! Make us love Madinaas much as we love Makka or even more so! O Allah, make it healthy for usand bless us in our<I> sa' </I>and in our <I>mudd</I>. Remove its fever andput it in al-Juhfa!'"<P><P><B>IX. Visiting sick children</B><P>5331. Abu 'Uthman reported from Usama ibn Zayd &#163; that a daughter ofthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent for him whilehe, Sa'd and Ubayy were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace. She said, "We believe that my daughter is near death, please attendus." He sent his greetings to her and said, "What Allah takes is his andwhat He gives is His. Everything has a fixed term with Him, so she shouldshow fortitude and expect a reward." She sent to him adjuring him to cometo her. He said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gotup and we got up as well. The child was placed in the lap of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and its breathing was ragged. Tearsfell from the eyes of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.Sa'd said, "Messenger of Allah, what is this?" He answered, "This is an aspectof mercy which Allah has put in the hearts of whomever He wishes of His slaves.Allah is only merciful to His slaves who are merciful."<P><P><B>X. Visiting sick bedouins</B><P>5332. 'Ikrima related from Ibn 'Abbas &#163; that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, went to visit a bedouin. He said, "When theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visited a sick person,he would say, "No harm, it is purification if Allah wills." He said, "Yousay, 'Purification', you say? No indeed. Rather it is a fever which boilsor burns in old man which will lead him to the graves." The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Yes, then may it be so."<P><P><B>XI. Visiting a sick idolator</B><P>5333. Thabit reported from Anas that a boy belonging to a Jew used to servethe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He became ill and theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to visit him. He said,"Become Muslim," and he became Muslim.<P>Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab reported from his father, "When Abu Talib was dying,the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to him."<P><P><B>XII. When someone visits someone who is ill and then leads the peoplein the prayer when the time for the prayer comes</B><P>5334. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "Some people visited the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was ill. He led them inthe prayer while sitting down and they started to pray standing. He indicatedto them to sit down. When he had finished, he said, 'The Imam is only appointedto be followed. When he goes into <I>ruku</I>', go into <I>ruku'</I>, andwhen he rises, rise. When he prays sitting down, you should pray sittingdown.'"<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that al-Humaydi said, "This <I>hadith</I> was abrogatedbecause in the last that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,prayed, he prayed sitting while the people were standing behind him."<P><P><B>XIII. Placing one's hand on the patient</B><P>5335. 'A'isha bint Sa'd related that her father said, "I became gravely illin Makka and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came tovisit me. I said, 'Prophet of Allah, I have property and my only heir isone daughter. Should I will away two-thirds of my property and leave a third?''No,' he answered. I said, 'Shall I will away a half and leave a half?' 'No,'he answered. I said, 'Shall I will away a third and leave her two-thirds?'He said, 'A third, but a third is a lot.' Then he placed his hand on my foreheadand wiped his hand over my face and abdomen and then said, 'O Prophet! CureSa'd and let him complete his hijra.' It seems that I can still feel itscoolness even now."<P>5336. Al-Harith ibn Suwayd related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "I visitedthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when hewas suffering from a very high fever. I touched him with my hand and said,'Messenger of Allah, you have a very high fever.' The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ''Yes, I have the fever oftwo of your men.' I asked, 'Is that because you will have two rewards?' Hesaid, 'Yes, it is like that. No Muslim is afflicted by harm, whether it isa thorn or something worse, without Allah expiating his evil deeds on thataccount and his sins fall away from him like leaves fall from a tree.'"<P><P><B>XIV. What is said to a sick person and how he should answer</B><P>5337. Al-Harith ibn Suwayd related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "I visitedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he was sufferingfrom a very high fever. I touched him with my hand and said, 'You have avery high fever. Is that because you will have two rewards?' He said, 'Yes,there is no Muslim who is afflicted by harm but that his errors will fallfrom him as the leaves fall from a tree.'"<P>5338. 'Ikrima related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, visited a man who was ill and said, "No harm,it is purification if Allah wills." He said, "No, it is a fever which boilsor burns in old man which will lead him to the graves." The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Yes, then may it be so."<P><P><B>XV. Visiting a sick person riding, walking or riding with someone elseon a donkey</B><P>5339. It is related from 'Urwa that Usama ibn Zayd told him that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rode a donkey with a clothmade in Fadak and Usama ibn Zayd was riding behind him. He went to visitSa'd ibn 'Ubada before the Battle of Badr. He proceeded until he passed bya gathering which contained 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, and that was before'Abdullah ibn Ubayy became Muslim. The gathering contained a mixture of Muslims,idolaters, pagans, and Jews. 'Abdullah ibn Rawaha was in the gathering. Whenthe dust from the donkey reached the gathering, 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy coveredhis nose with his cloak and then said, "Don't cover us with dust!" The Messengerof Allah* greeted them and then stopped, He dismounted and invited them toAllah and recited the Qur'an to them. 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul said,"O man! There is nothing better than what you say if it is the truth. Sodo not annoy us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount and recountto whoever comes to you." 'Abdullah ibn Rawaha said, "Indeed, Messenger ofAllah! Bring it to us in our gatherings. We like that!" So the Muslims, idolatersand Jews abused one another until they were practically fighting. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, kept on calming them down untilthey were quiet. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,mounted his animals and went until he visited Sa'd ibn 'Ubada. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, "Sa'd, did you nothear what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy) said?" Sa'd said, "O Messengerof Allah, pardon him and overlook it. Allah has given you what He has givenyou. The people of this little town had agreed to crown him and bind hishead with a (royal) turban. When Allah refused that by the truth which Allahgave you, he was vexed on that account. That is why he did what you saw."<P>5340. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir related that Jabir said, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, came to visit me and he did not ridea mule nor a horse."<P><P><B>XVI. It is allowed for someone ill to say, "I am suffering" or "O my head"or "My illness is severe."</B><P>The words of Ayyub, peace be upon him,<I> "Great harm has afflicted me andYou are the Most Merciful of the merciful."</I> (21:83)<P>5341. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Layla reported that Ka'b ibn 'Ujra said, "TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, passed by me while I waslighting a fire under a pot. He asked, 'Are the lice on your head causingyou trouble?' 'Yes,' I answered. He called for a barber to shave my headand then ordered me to do expiation for that."<P>5342. Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said that 'A'isha said, "O my head!" The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If that had beenwhile I was alive, I would have asked Allah to forgive you and make supplicationfor you." 'A'isha said, "O my loss! By Allah, I think that you want for meto die. If that were to happen, you would spend the rest of your day sleepingwith one of your wives!" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "Rather I should say, 'O my head!' I should (or Iwanted) to send for Abu Bakr and his son and appoint him lest some peoplesay [that the khalifate is for a certain person] or some people wish forit Then I said, 'Allah would refuse it to someone not entitled and the believerswould prevent it, (or Allah would prevent it and the believers refuse it).'"<P>5343. Al-Harith ibn Suwayd related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "I visitedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he was sufferingfrom a very high fever. I touched him with my hand and said, 'You have avery high fever.' He said, 'Yes, like that of two men.' I asked, 'Is thatbecause you will have two rewards?' He said, 'Yes, there is no Muslim whois afflicted by any harm by illness or something else but that Allah willremove his evil deeds from him as a tree sheds its leaves.'"<P>5344. 'Amir ibn Sa'd related that his father said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to visit me when I was veryill at the time of the Farewell Hajj. I said, 'You see how severe my illnessit. I have property and my only heir is my daughter. Can I give away two-thirdsof it as <I>sadaqa</I>?' 'No,' he answered. I said, 'A half?' 'No,' he answered.I said, 'A third.' He said, 'A third is a lot. It is better to leave yourheirs wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from people. You will be rewardedfor whatever you spend for the sake of Allah, even what you put in your wife'smouth.'"<P><P><B>XVII. The words of a sick person, "Leave me!"</B><P>5345. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was dying, there were some men in thehouse which included 'Umar ibn al-Khattab. The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'Come. Let me write a document for you after whichyou will never go astray.' 'Umar said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, is overcome by pain. We have the Qur'an and the Bookof Allah is enough for us.' The people in the house disagreed and quarrelled.Some of them said, 'Go near so that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, can write a document for you after which you will nevergo astray.' Others said what 'Umar said. When there was a lot of noise anddisagreement in the presence of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Leave me!'"<P>'Ubaydullah said, "Ibn 'Abbas used to say, 'It was a disaster, a completedisaster, that prevented the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, from writing down that document for them because of theirdisagreement and noise."<P><P><B>XVIII. The one who brings a sick child so that supplication can be madefor him</B><P>5346. Al-Ju'ayd related he heard as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid say, "My aunt took meto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,'Messenger of Allah, my nephew is ill.' So he stroked my head and prayedfor blessing for me. Then he did wudu' and I drank some of his wudu' water.Then I stood behind him and saw the seal of prophethood between his shoulders.It was like a partridge egg."<P><P><B>XIX. Someone who is ill wishing for death</B><P>5347. Thabit al-Bunani related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you should wish for deathbecause of some harm which has befallen him. If he has got to do something,he should say, 'O Allah, make live if life is best for me and make me dieif death is best for me."<P>5348. It is related that Qays ibn Abi Hazim said, "We went to visit Khabbabwhen he was ill. He had been cauterised seven times. He said, 'Our companionswho went before us have gone and this world did not cause them any decrease.We have acquired so much that the only way to spend it is in constructingbuildings. If it were not that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, had forbidden us to pray for death, I would have prayed for it.'<P>"Then we came to him again when he was repairing one of his walls and hesaid, 'A Muslim is rewarded for everything he spends except for what he investsin buildings.'"<P>5349. Abu 'Ubayd, the client of 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf, related that AbuHurayra said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, say, 'No one will enter the Garden through his deeds.' They asked,'Not even you, Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'No, not even me, unless Allahcovers me in grace and mercy.' Seek the correct and draw near. None of youshould wish for death. If he does good, he may increase in it, and if hedoes evil, he may turn in repentance.'"<P>5350. 'Abbad ibn 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr said, "I heard 'A'isha say, 'Whilethe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was leaning againstme, I heard him say, "O Allah, forgive me and show mercy to me and join meto the (Highest) Companion."'"<P><P><B>XX. A vistor making supplication for the invalid</B><P>'A'isha bint Sa'd reported from her father, "O Prophet, heal Sa'd!" The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said that.<P>5351. It is related from Masruq from 'A'isha that when the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to visit someone who was illor someone who was ill was brought to him, he would say, "Remove the harm,Lord of people! Heal! You are the Healer. There is no healing exept Yourhealing, a healing which leaves no illness behind."<P>It is related from Ibrhaim and Abu'd-Duha, "When he was brought a someonewho was ill."<P>It is related from Abu'd-Duha alone, "When he went to a sick person."<P><P><B>XXI. A visitor doing wudu' for someone ill</B><P>5352. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said, "I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, 'TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visited me while I wasill. He did <I>wudu' </I>and poured it over me. Or he said, 'Pour it overhim.' I regained my senses and said, 'I have no heirs to inherit from me.What happens with the inheritance?' Then the <I>Ayat</I> of Shares of Inheritancewas revealed."<P><P><B>XXII. The one who prayed for the removal of the epidemics and fever</B><P>5353. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, came to Madina, Abu Bakr and Bilal camedown with a fever. I visited them said, 'Father, how are you? Bilal, howare you?' When Abu Bakr's fever got worse, he would say:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  'Every man is struck down among his people in the morning.  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Death is nearer than the strap of his sandal.'</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>When the fever left Bilal, he raised his voice and said,<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  'Would that I knew whether I would spend a night in the valley of Makka  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the sweet rushes and panic grass around me!  <P>  Will I one day return to the waters of Majinna?  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will the mountains of Shama and Tafil appear to me?'"</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>'A'isha said, "I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and told him and he said, 'O Allah! Make us love Madinaas much as we love Makka or even more so! O Allah, make it healthy for usand bless us in our <I>sa'</I> and in our <I>mudd</I>. Remove its fever andput it in al-Juhfa!'"<P><P><B><BIG><A NAME="tibb">Chapter 79. The Book of Medicine</A></BIG></B><P><P><B>I. Allah has not sent down an illness without sending down a cure forit</B><P>5354. 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah has not sent down an illnesswithout sending down a cure for it."<P><P><B>II. Can a man treat a woman or a woman treat a man?</B><P>5355. Khalid ibn Dhakwan related that Rubayyi' bint Mu'awwidh ibn 'Afra'said, "We used to go on expeditions with the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and we would bring water to the people andserve them, and we would bring back the dead and wounded to Madina."<P><P><B>III. There is healing in three</B><P>5356. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "There is healing inthree: a drink of honey, scarification for cupping and cauterisation by fire.I forbid my community to use cauterisation." The hadith is marfu'.<P>Mujahid related it from Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, about honey and cupping.<P>5357. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "There is healing in three: scarificationfor cupping, a drink of honey or cauterisation by fire. I forbid my communityto use cauterisation."<P><P><P><B>IV. Treatment with honey</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Containing healing for mankind."</I> (16:69)<P>5358. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, liked sweets and honey."<P>5359. 'Asim ibn 'Umar ibn Qatada said, "I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said,'I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,say, "If there is any good in your medical treatments, it is in scarificationfor cupping, a drink of honey, or a light cauterisation by fire when thatis appropriate to the illness. I do not like to be cauterised."'"<P>5360. Abu'l-Mutawakkil related from Abu Sa'id that a man came to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "My brother has an intestinalillness." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Lethim drink honey." He came a second time and the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Let him drink honey." Then he came a thirdtime and he again said, "Let him drink honey." Then he came to him and said,"I have done it." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"Allah spoke the truth and the stomach of your brother has lied. Let himdrink honey." He gave it to him and he was cured.<P><P><B>V. Treatment with camel milk</B><P>5361. Thabit related from Anas that some people became ill and said, "Messengerof Allah, give us shelter and food." When they became healthy, they said,"Madina is unhealthy." He sent them to al-Harra with some she-camels of hisand said, "Drink their milk." Once they became healthy, they murdered theherdsman of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and droveaway the camels. He sent people after them and had their hands and feet cutoff and nails were driven in their eyes. I saw a man of them biting the earthuntil he died.<P>Sallam said, "I heard that al-Hajjaj said to Anas, 'Tell me the worst punishmentinflicted by the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and sohe reported this to him." Al-Hasan heard about that and said, "I wish thathe had not transmitted it."<P><P><B>VI. Treating with camel urine</B><P>5362. Qatada related that Anas said, "Some people fell ill in Madina andthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, instructed them tojoin his herdsman and drink the camel's milk and urine. They joined the herdsmanand drank their milk and urine until their bodies became healthy. Then theykilled the herdsman and stole the camels. The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, heard about that and sent in their pursuit and theywere brought. He had their hands and feet cut off and nails put in theireyes."<P>Qatada said, "Muhammad ibn Sirin related to me that that was before the<I>hudud</I> were revealed."<P><P><B>VII.

It was said, "This is your community.Seventy thousand of them will enter the Garden without reckoning." Then heentered his house without making clear who they were. The people startedto talk and said, "We are those who have believed in Allah in followed HisMessenger. It is us. Or it is our children who were born in Islam while wewere born in the <I>Jahiliyya</I>." The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, heard about that and came out and said, "They are thosewho do not use incantation and do not seek omens and are not cauterised andtrust in their Lord."

He went out, supported by two men, with his feet draggingon the ground. It was Ibn 'Abbas and another man.' I reported it to Ibn 'Abbasand he said, "Do you know who the other man was that 'A'isha did not name?''No,' I answered.

Perhaps I willbe able to instruct the people." She said, "We sat him in a tub belongingto Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and started to pour the water in those waterskins over him until he indicatedto us to stop.

They drank the milk and urine of the camels and went untilthey reached part of al-Harra. Then they disbelieved after becoming Muslimand killed the herdsman of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and stole the camels. The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, heard about it and sent a search after them and he commandedthat nails be driven into their eyes and their hands cut off and they wereleft in the region of al-Harra until they died as they were."<P><P><B>XXIX.

They disagreed. Some of them said, 'You have setout on a matter and we do not think that you should retreat from it.' Otherssaid, 'With you are the rest of the people and the Companions of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we do not think thatyou should expose them to this plague.' He said, 'Leave me.' Then he said,'Call the Ansar for me,' and I called them and he consulted them. They behavedas the Muhajirun had done and disagreed as they had disagreed. He said, 'Leaveme.' Then he said, 'Call for me those who are here of the elders of Qurayshwho emigrated before the Conquest of Makka.' So I called them, and therewere not two of them who disagreed about it. They said, 'We think that youshould return with the people and not expose them to this plague.' So 'Umarmade an announcement among the people: 'I am travelling back in the morning,so travel back then as well.' Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah said, 'Are you fleeingfrom the decree of Allah?' 'Umar said, 'If only someone other than you hadsaid that, Abu 'Ubayda!' Yes, we are fleeing from the decree of Allah tothe decree of Allah. Do you think that if you had camels and they went downinto a valley which had two sides, one of which was fertile and the otherbarren, and you grazed them on the fertile side, that that grazing wouldbe by the decree of Allah, and if you grazed them on the barren side, thatthat grazing would not be by the decree of Allah?'" 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf,who had been absent on some errand, then came and said, 'I have some knowledgeof this. I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, say, "When you hear that it is in a land, do not go to it. When itcomes to a land where you are, do not leave it, fleeing from it.'" 'Umarpraised Allah and then left."<P>5398. Ibn Shihab related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amir that 'Umar set out forSyria.

There is no one who comes intocontact with the plague and then remains with fortitude in the land wherehe is, knowing that only what Allah has written for him will befall him,but that he has a similar reward to that of the martyr."<P>An-Nadr corroborated it from Dawud.<P><P><B>XXXI.

They said, "You did not give us hospitality,so we will not do that unless you give us a wage for it." They allotted somesheep for them. [One] recited the Umm al-Qur'an and collected his salivaand spat it on the spot. The man was cured and they brought the sheep. The[Companions] said, "We will not take them until we ask the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace." They asked him and he laughed and said, "Howdid you know that it is an incantation? Take it and gave me a share."<P><P><B>XXXIII. Stipulating sheep as payment for a ruqya</B><P>5405.

By the waterthere is a person who has been stung or bitten." One of their men went andrecited the <I>Fatiha</I> of the Book in exchange for a sheep. The man recoveredand he brought the sheep to his companions. They disliked that and said,"You took a wage for the Book of Allah." When they reached Madina, they said,"Messenger of Allah, he has taken a wage for the Book of Allah." The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "You are more entitledto take wages for what you did with the Book of Allah."<P><P><B>XXXIV.

'Urwa reported from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, used to do incantation, saying, "Lord of people,remove the trouble. Healing is in Your hand. None can remove it but You!"<P>5413. 'Urwa reported from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, used to say to the sick person, "In the Nameof Allah, when the earth of our land is mixed the saliva of one of us, itmay heal our sick by the permission of our Lord."<P>5414. 'Amra related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, used to say in the incantation, 'When the earth of ourland is mixed the saliva of one of us, it may heal our sick by the permissionof our Lord.'"<P><P><B>XXXVIII. Blowing (<I>nafth</I>) in the incantation (<I>ruqya</I>)</B><P>5415. Abu Salama said that he heard Abu Qatada say, "I heard the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'A good dream is from Allahand a bad dream is from Shaytan. When one of you sees something he dislikes,he should blow* three times when he wakes up and seek refuge from its eviland it will not harm him." Abu Salama said, "If I see a dream which is heavieron me than a mountain, I have not been concerned about it since I heard this<I>hadith</I>."'"<P>[*<I>Nafth</I> is either blowing without spit, or with a slight amount aswhen one spits out a pip.]<P>5416. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr reported that 'A'isha said, "When the Prophet,&nbsp;may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to bed, he blew on hishands after reciting <I>Surat al-Ikhlas</I> and the two <I>suras</I> of refugeand then he would wipe his face and his body with them as far as his handscould reach." 'A'isha added, "When he was ill, he used to tell me to do thatfor him." Yunus said, "I used to see Ibn Shihab do that when he went to bed."<P>5417. Abu'l-Mutawakkil related that Abu Sa'id said, "A group of the Companionsof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on a journeyand halted near one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality butthey refused to give them any. The chief of that tribe was bitten or stung[by a snake or scorpion] and they tried everything, but nothing helped. Oneof them said, 'If you were to go to those people who camped near you, perhapsone of them has something.' So they went to them and said, 'Our chief hasbeen stung and we have tried everything but nothing has helped him. Doesany of you have anything [which will help]?' One of them said, 'Yes, by Allah.I can recite an incantation, but, by Allah, we asked you for hospitalityand you did not give it to us. I will not recite it for you until you stipulatea payment for us.' They agreed to pay them a certain number of sheep. Hewent and spat on it while reciting, 'Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher andSustainer of the worlds.' It was as if the chief was released from a hobbleand he began to walk and there was nothing wrong with him. He said, 'Paythem their wage which you agreed with them.' One of the [Muslims] said, 'Divideit up.' The one who had recited said, 'Do not do it until we reach the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. We will tell him what happened andsee what he commands us.' They went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and mentioned it to him. He said, 'How didyou know that it is an incantation?' Then he said, 'You were right. Divideand give me a share as well.'"<P><P><B>XXXIX. The one doing the incantation wiping the one who is ill with hisright hand</B><P>5418. Masruq related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, used to recite the refuge prayer for some of them, wipinghim with his right hand, saying 'Remove the hardship, Lord of people, andheal, You are the Healer. There is no healing except Your healing, a healingwhich does not leave behind any illness.'"<P>I mentioned the like of it to Mansur from Ibrahim from Masruq from 'Abdu'r-Rahman(i.e. with a different <I>isnad</I> before it reaches Masruq).<P><P><B>XL. A woman doing an incantation (<I>ruqya</I>) for a man</B><P>5419. 'Urwa related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, used to blow on himself in the illness from which he diedafter reciting the refuge <I>suras</I>. When his illness was worse, I usedto blow them over him and wipe his hand over him for the blessing."<P>I (Ma'mar) asked Ibn Shihab, "How did he blow (<I>nafth</I>)?" He answered,"He used to blow on his hands and then wipe his face with them."<P><P><B>XLI. Those who did not use incantation</B><P>5420. Sa'id ibn Jubayr reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, "One day the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out to us and said,'All the nations were shown to me. A Prophet will pass by with one man, aProphet with two men, a Prophet with a small band of people, and a Prophetwith no one with him. Then I saw an enormous mass which blocked out the horizonand I hoped that they would be my community. It was said, "This is Musa andhis people." Then I was told, "Look at the horizon," and there was a darkmass which filled the horizon. Then it was said to me, 'Look,' and therewas a mass which filled the horizon. It was said, 'This is your communityand among them are seventy thousand who will enter the Garden without reckoning.'Then the people broke up when he had not made them clear. The Companionsof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to discussit and said, 'We were born in shirk, but we believed in Allah and His Messenger.Rather they are our sons.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, heard about that and said, "They are those who do not look for omens,do not make charms, are not cauterised and trust in their Lord." 'Ukashaibn Mihsan stood and asked, 'Am I one of them, Messenger of Allah?' 'Yes,'he answered. Another stood and asked, 'Am I one of them?" He said, ''Ukashahas beaten up to it.'"<P><P><B>XLII. Looking for omens in birds</B><P>5421. Salim related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no contagion and no omens.There may be bad luck in three: women, houses and animals."<P>5422. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba related that Abu Hurayra said,"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,say, 'There are no omens. The best of it is a good sign.' They asked, 'Whatis the good sign?' He answered, 'A good word that one of you hears.'"<P><P><B>XLIII. The good sign</B><P>5423. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba related that Abu Hurayra said,'I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,say, 'There are no omens. The best of it is a good sign.' They asked, 'Whatis the good sign?' He answered, 'A good word that one of you hears.'"<P>5424. Qatada related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "There is no contagion. I like the good sign, whichis the good word."<P><P><B>XLIV. There is no <I>hama</I> </B><P>[One text adds "and no bad luck in Safar" See 5380 for<I><A HREF="bukhari39.html#hama">hama</A></I>.]<P>5425. Abu Salih related from Abu Huryara that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "There is no contagion and no omen nor<I>hama</I> nor bad luck in the month of Safar."<P><P><B>XLV. Soothsaying</B><P>5426. Abu Salama related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, gave a judgement about two women ofHudhayl who had fought one another and one of them threw a stone at the other.The stone hit her in the abdomen and, as she was pregnant, it killed herchild. They took the dispute to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and he judged that the blood money for what was in her womb waswas a slave of fair complexion and excellence (<I>ghurra</I>), male or female.The guardian of the woman who was liable said, 'Messenger of Allah, how canI be liable for someone who has neither drunk nor eaten, nor spoken nor cried.The life of this should be nullified." The Prophet* observed, "This is oneof the brothers of the soothsayers."<P>[This was because he spoke in <I>saj'</I>, rhymed prose, which was also usedby soothsayers.]<P>5427. Abu Salama related from Abu Hurayra that two women (fought) and onethrew a stone at the other and caused her foetus to miscarry. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, judged a good slave, male or female,[as the blood money] for it.<P>Ibn Shihab related from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave a judgement that the compensationfor a foetus killed in its mother's womb was a slave of fair complexion andexcellence, male or female. The one against whom judgement was given said,'Why should I pay damages for that which did not drink or eat or speak ormake ant cry. The like of this is nothing The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "This is one of the brothers of the soothsayers."<P>5428. Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Harith related that Abu Mas'ud said,"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the proceedsfrom the sale of dogs, money earned through prostitution and the earningsof a soothsayer."<P>5429. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr related that 'A'isha said, "Some people asked theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about soothsayers.He said, 'They have nothing.' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, sometimes theytell us something and then it turns out to be true.' The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'That is a true word whicha jinn caught hold of and poured into the ear of his friend, but they mixa hundred lies with it.'"<P>'Ali said that 'Abdu'r-Razzaq said that "a true word" is <I>mursal</I>.

Magic</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"The shaytans rejected, teaching people sorceryand what had been sent down to Harut and Marut, the two angels in Babylon,who taught no one until they had said to him, 'We are merely a trial andtemptation, so do not reject.'

'Urwa related that 'A&Otilde;isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was bewitched by a man of the Banu Zurayq calledLabid ibn al-A'sam so that he would imagine that he had done a thing whichhe had not done it until one day or night while he was with me, he madesupplication and did so again. Then he said, ''A'isha, are aware that Allahhas informed me of what I asked Him about? Two men came to me and one ofthem sat at my head and the other and at my feet, and one said to the other,"What ails the man?" "Bewitched," he answered. He said, "And who has bewitchedhim?" He replied, "Labid ibn al-A'sam." He said, "Using what?" He replied,"A comb, the hairs in it (<I>mushata</I>), and the husk of a male palm spathe."He asked, "Where is it?" He said, "In the well of Dharwan."' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to it with some of hisCompanions and then came back. He said, ''A'isha, its water is the colourof henna infusion. The heads of its palms are like the heads of devils.'I asked, 'Messenger of Allah, did you take it out?" He answered, "Allah hascured me and I fear that that would provoke evil among the people." Thenhe ordered that the well be filled in."<P>Abu Usama, Abu Damra and Ibn Abi'z-Zinad corroborated it from Hisham."<P>Al-Layth and Ibn 'Uyayna reported from Hisham "a comb and fibres(<I>mushaqa</I>)."<P>It is said that <I>mushata</I> is the hair which comes out when one combsthe hair. <I>Mushaqa</I> are shreds of flax of cotton."<P><P><B>XLVII. <I>Shirk</I> and magic are deadly sins</B><P>5431. Abu'-Ghayth related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Avoid the fatal sins: shirkin Allah and magic."<P><P><B>XLVIII. Should the source of magic be extracted from where it is?</B><P>Qatada said, "I asked Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, 'If a man is bewitched or unableto come to his wife, can he seek to undo it or use <I>nushra*</I>?' 'Yes,'he answered, 'There is no harm in that. By it they desire to put things right.That which is beneficial for people is not forbidden.'"<P>[<I>Nushra</I> is reciting verses over water which is then used by the personafflicted.]<P>5432. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was bewitched so that he would imagine thathe had had intercourse with his wives when he had not. (Sufyan said, "Thisis the worst type of magic when it does that.") He said, ''A'isha, do youknow that Allah has given me a decision in what I asked Him about? Two mencame to me and one of them sat at my head and the other and at my feet, andthe one at my head said to the other, "What ails the man?" "Bewitched," heanswered. He said, "And who has bewitched him?" He replied, "Labid ibn al-A'sam,a man of the Banu Zurayq, the allies of the Jews, who is a hypocrite." Hesaid, "Using what?" He replied, "A comb and flax fibres." He asked, "Whereis it?" He said, "Inside a male palm spadex under a stone in the well ofDharwan."' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went tothe well to remove it. He said, 'This is the well that I was shown.' Itswater was the colour of henna infusion and the date palms looks like theheads of devils. He said, 'It was taken out.' I asked, 'Why do not use<I>nushra</I>?' He replied, 'By Allah, Allah has cured me. I dislike to provokeevil against anyone.'"<P><P><B>XLIX. Magic</B><P>5433.

Some eloquence is part of magic</B><P>5434. Zayd ibn Aslam reported from Ibn 'Umar that two men came from the eastand spoke and people were astonished at their eloquence. The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is some eloquence thatis magic," or "Some of eloquence is magic."<P>[The two men are said to be 'Amr ibn al-Ahtam at-Tamimi and az-Zibriqan ibnBadr at-Tamimi.]<P><P><B>LI.

The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'What infected the first?'"<P>Abu Salama said that he heard Abu Hurayra say that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Someone with sick camels should notbring them to water with sound ones." Abu Hurayra did not acknowledge thefirst <I>hadith</I>. We said, "Did you not relate, 'There is nocontagion&Eacute;?'" Abu Salama said, "I did not see him forget any<I>hadith</I> other than this."<P><P><B>LIII. There is no contagion</B><P>5438. Salim ibn 'Abdullah and Hamza reported that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar saidthat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"There is no contagion and no bad omens. Bad luck may be in three: horses,women and houses."<P>5439.

Sa'id ibn Abi Sa'id is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When Khaybarwas conquered, a poisoned sheep was presented to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

They were gathered for him and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, &nbsp;said, 'I am going to ask you about something.Will you tell me the truth about it?' They answered, 'Yes, Abu'l-Qasim.'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked them,'Who is your father?' They said, 'Our father is so-and-so.' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'You have lied.Your father is so-and-so.' They said, 'You spoke the truth and have spokentruly.'

They answered, 'We will be in it for a short time andthen you will replace us in it.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'May you be basely driven into it! By Allah, we will neverreplace you in it!' Then he said, 'Will you tell me the truth about somethingif I ask you about it?' They answered, 'Yes.' He asked, 'Did you put poisonin this sheep?'

Taking poison and using it for medical treatment, or using what maybe dangerous or something impure</B><P>5442. Dhakwan was heard to relate from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone throws himself offa mountain and kills himself, in the Fire of Hell he will be throwing himselfdown forever.

Abu Idris al-Khawlani related that Abu Tha'laba al-Khushani said, "TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade eating every beastof prey with fangs." Az-Zuhri said, "I did not hear this until I came toSyria." Al-Layth added, "Yunus related to me from Ibn Shihab. He said, 'Iasked him, "Can we do wudu' or drink the milk of she-asses, the bile of beastsof prey or the urine of camels?" He answered, "The Muslims used to use it(camel urine) to treat themselves and did not see any harm in it. As forthe milk of she-asses, it has reached us that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, forbade their meat, but neither a commandor a prohibition has reached me about their milk. As for the bile of beastsof prey, Ibn Shihab said, "Abu Idris al-Khawlani told me that Abu Tha'labaal-Khushani told him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, forbade eating every beast of prey with fangs."'"<P><P><B>LVII.
