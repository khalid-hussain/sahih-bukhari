<B>I: The obligation of fasting Ramadan </B>
<P>
and the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"You who believe! Fasting is prescribed
for you, as it was prescribed for those before you &#150; so that perhaps
you will be godfearing.</I>" (2:183)
<P>
1792. It is related from Talha ibn 'Ubaydullah that a bedouin with unkempt
hair came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and said, "Messenger of Allah, tell me what Allah has made obligatory for
me in respect of prayer." He said, "The five prayers unless you want to do
some extra voluntary ones." He said, "Tell me what Allah has made obligatory
for me in respect of fasting." He said, "The month of Ramadan unless you
want to do something extra." He said, "Tell me what Allah has made obligatory
for me in respect of <I>zakat</I>." Talha said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, informed him about the laws of Islam.
He said, 'By the One who has honoured you, I will not do anything extra nor
any less than what Prophet has made obligatory on me.' The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If he speaks the truth, he
will have success - or he will enter the Garden if he speaks the truth.'"
<P>
1793. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to fast the Day of 'Ashura' and commanded that
it be fasted. Then when Ramadan was made obligatory, it was abandoned." 'Abdullah
used only to fast it when it coincided with his normal pattern of fasting.
<P>
1794. It is related from 'A'isha, "Quraysh used to fast the Day of 'Ashura'
in the time of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, commanded that it be fasted until Ramadan
was made obligatory. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Anyone who wants to can fast it, and anyone who wants to
can break the fast.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The excellence of fasting</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#57">1795</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Fasting
is a shield, so people should not have sexual relations nor act stupidly.
If someone fights them or insults them, they should say, 'I am fasting' twice.
By the One in whose hand my self is, the changed breath in the mouth of the
faster is more fragrant to Allah Almighty than the scent of musk. [He says],
'He has left his food and drink and appetites for My sake. Fasting is Mine
and I repay it. Any other good deed I repay with ten like it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Fasting is an expiation</B>
<P>
1796. It is related that Hudhayfa said that 'Umar said, "Does anyone amongst
you remember what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said about trial and tribulation (<I>fitna</I>)?' Hudhayfa said, 'I
heard him say, "The trial (<I>fitna</I>) of a man in respect of his wife,
wealth, children and neighbours is expiated by prayer, fasting and
<I>sadaqa</I>." He said, 'I am not asking about that, but rather the tribulation
which spreads like the waves of the sea." Hudhayfa said, "There is a closed
door in front of it." He said, "Will it be broken down or opened?" He said,
"It will be broken down." He said, "Then it will never be closed until the
Day of Rising." We said to Masruq, "Ask him if 'Umar know what the door was?"
He said, "Yes, as surely as night follows day."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Ar-Rayyan is for the fasters</B>
<P>
1797. It is related from Sahl that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "There is a gate in the Garden called ar-Rayyan which those
who fast will enter on the Day of Rising, and none but they will enter it."
It will be said, 'Where are the fasters?' They will stand up and none but
they will enter it. When they have entered it, it will be closed and no one
else will enter it."
<P>
1798. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The one who spends out two kinds of
actions in the way of Allah will be summoned from the gates of the Garden
and told, 'O slave of Allah, this is better.' All the people who did the
prayer will be called from the gate of the prayer. All the people who did
<I>jihad</I> will be called from the gate of <I>jihad</I>. All the people
who fasted will be called from the gate of Rayyan. All the people who gave
sadaqa will be called from the gate of <I>sadaqa</I>." Abu Bakr said, "May
my father and mother be sacrificed for you, Messenger of Allah. No one called
from those gates will feel distress. Will anyone be called from all those
gates?" He said, "Yes, and I hope that you will be among them."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Whether it is correct to say "Ramadan" or "the month of Ramadan"? Someone
thinking that that both are allowed. </B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who fasts
Ramadan" and he said, "Do not precede Ramadan."
<P>
1799. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When Ramadan comes, the gates of the
Garden are opened."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#59">1800</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When
the month of Ramadan arrives, the gates of heaven are opened, the gates of
Hellfire closed, and the shaytans are chained."
<P>
1801. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'When you see it, fast. When
you see it, break the fast. If it is cloudy, then calculate it.'" Someone
else said from al-Layth that 'Uqayl and Yunus related, "The new moon of Ramadan."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Someone fasting Ramadan motivated by belief and in anticipation of
the reward and with intention</B>
<P>
'A'isha reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"They will be raised up according to their intentions."
<P>
1802. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who spends the Night of Power in prayer
motivated by belief and in anticipation of the reward will be forgiven his
past wrong actions. Whoever fasts Ramadan motivated by belief and in anticipation
of the reward will be forgiven his past wrong actions."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was never more
generous than in Ramadan</B>
<P>
1803. Ibn 'Abbas related saying, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was the most generous of people with good things, and he was even
more generous during Ramadan when Jibril met him. Jibril, peace be upon him,
used to meet him every night in Ramadan until it was over and the Prophet*
would go through the Qur'an with him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was more generous with good things than the blowing
wind."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Someone not abandoning lies and acting by them while fasting</B>
<P>
1804. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Allah is not in need of anyone abandoning
his food and drink who does not abandon lies and acting by them while fasting."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Should someone say, "I am fasting" when he is insulted?</B>
<P>
1805. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah said, 'Every action of
the son of Adam is for himself except for fasting. It is Mine and I repay
it.' Fasting is a shield. When someone is fasting, he should not have sexual
relations nor quarrel. If someone fights him or insults him, he should say,
'I am fasting'. By the One in whose hand the self of Muhammad is, the changed
breath in the mouth of the faster is more fragrant to Allah Almighty than
the scent of musk. The faster experiences two joys: when he breaks his fast
he rejoices and when he meets his Lord he rejoices in his fasting."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Fasting for the one who fears for himself the consequences of being
unmarried </B>
<P>
1806. It is related that 'Alqama said, "While I was walking with 'Abdullah,
he said, 'We were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said, "Any of you who can afford to should marry. It restrains the
eye and protects the private parts. Anyone who is unable to should fast.
It restrains the appetite."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The words of the Prophet, "Fast when you see the new moon and break
the fast when you see it." </B>
<P>
'Ammar said, "Anyone who fasts the day of doubt has disobeyed Abu'l-Qasim."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#1">1807</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned
Ramadan and said, "Do not fast until you see the new moon and do not break
the fast until you see it. If it is cloudy, then you must calculate it."
<P>
1808. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The month is twenty-nine
nights. Do not fast until you see it. If it is cloudy, then make it a full
thirty days."
<P>
1809. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The month is like this and this," and he
left out his thumb the third time."
<P>
1810. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said (or Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said), "Fast when you see it and break the fast when you see it.
If it is cloudy, then make Sha'ban complete with thirty days."
<P>
1811. It is related from Umm Salama, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, vowed to stay away from his wives for a month. After twenty-nine
days, he went in the morning or afternoon. It was said to him, 'You vowed
not to go in for a month.' He said, 'The month is twenty-nine days.'"
<P>
1812. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, swore to stay away from his wives for a month.
He had dislocated his leg and he stayed in an attic room he had for twenty-nine
nights. Then he came and they said, 'Messenger of Allah, you swore that you
would not go to your wives for a month.' He said, 'The month is twenty-nine
days.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: The two months of <I>'Id</I> do not decrease</B>
<P>
Ishaq said, "Even if it is incomplete, it is still complete." Muhammad said,
"They will never both be incomplete."
<P>
1813. It is related from Abu Bakra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace.
<P>
It is related from Abu Bakra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Two months are never incomplete: the two months of 'Id<I>:
Ramadan and Dhu'l-Hijja."</I>
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: The words of the Prophet, "We do not write nor calculate"</B>
<P>
1814. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "We are an unlettered nation. We do not write
nor calculate. The month is like this and this, i.e. sometimes twenty-nine
and sometimes thirty."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Not fasting a day or two before Ramadan</B>
<P>
1815. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "None of you should fast a day or two before Ramadan
except for a man who customarily fasts. He should fast that day."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: The words of Allah, may His mention be exalted, <I>"On the night of
the fast it is lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives. They
are clothing for you and you for them. Allah knows that you have been betraying
yourselves and He has turned towards you and excused you. Now you may have
sexual intercourse with them and seek what Allah has written for you."
</I>(2:187)</B>
<P>
1816. It is related that al-Bara' said, "Among the Companions of Muhammad,
if ever a man was fasting and the time of fast-breaking came and he had gone
to sleep before he broke his fast, he would not eat that night or the following
day until evening. Qays ibn Sirma al-Ansari was fasting and when it the time
of fast-breaking came, he went to wife and said to her, 'Do you have any
food?' She said, 'No, but I will go and look for you.' He worked during the
day and sleep overcame him. His wife returned to him and when she saw him
she said, 'Disappointment for you.' In the middle of the day, he fainted
and it was mentioned to the Prophet*. Then this <I>ayat</I> was sent down:<I>
'On the night of the fast it is lawful for you to have sexual relations with
your wives,' </I>and they were very happy about it. It was revealed,<I> 'Eat
and drink until you can clearly discern the white thread from the black thread
of the dawn.'</I>"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "'Eat and drink until you can clearly
discern the white thread from the black thread of the dawn. Then complete
the fast until the night appears." </I>(2:187) </B>
<P>
(The chain of transmission) contains Al-Bara' from the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
1817. It is related that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "When it was revealed,<I> 'Eat
and drink until you can clearly discern the white thread from the black thread',
</I>I got a black string and a white string and put them under my pillow.
I began to look at them during the night, but it was not clear to me. In
the morning I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and mentioned that to him and he said, 'That means the blackness
of the night and the whiteness of the day.'"
<P>
1818. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "When '<I>Eat and drink until
you can clearly discern the white thread from the black thread</I>' was sent
down and <I>'of &nbsp;the dawn' </I>had not been sent down, some men who
wanted to fast would tie a white thread and a black thread to their legs
and would continue to eat until they could see them clearly. Allah later
revealed<I> 'of the dawn' </I>and they then knew that it meant night and
day."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: The words of the Prophet, "Bilal's <I>adhan</I> should not stop
you from having your <I>sahur</I>." [pre-dawn meal]</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#15"><B> </B>1819</A>. It is related from 'A'isha, "Bilal
used to call the <I>adhan</I> whilst it was still night, and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said 'Eat and drink until
Ibn Umm Maktum calls the adhan. He does not call the <I>adhan</I> until it
is dawn.'" Al-Qasim said, "The time between the two <I>adhans</I> was only
long enough for this one to go up and that one to come down."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Delaying <I>sahur</I> </B>
<P>
1820. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "I used to have <I>sahur</I>
with my family and then I would hurry to to catch <I>sujud</I> with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: The amount of time between <I>sahur</I> and the <I>Fajr</I> prayer</B>
<P>
1821. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "We used to have <I>sahur</I>
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Then he stood
up for the prayer." Anas said, "I said, 'How long was there between the
<I>adhan</I> and <I>sahur</I>?' He said, 'Enough to recite fifty
<I>ayats</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: The blessing of <I>sahur</I> is not compulsory because the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his Companions used to fast
continuously without mentioning <I>sahur</I> </B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#38"><B> </B>1822</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to fast continuously
(<I>wisal</I>) and the people fasted continuously and it was hard for them
so he forbade them to do it. They said, "But you fast continuously." He said,
"I am not the same as you. I am fed and given to drink."
<P>
1823. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Have <I>sahur</I>. There is blessing
in <I>sahur</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: Someone making the intention to fast during the day</B>
<P>
Umm ad-Darda' said, "Abu'd-Darda' would say, 'Do you have any food?' If we
said no, he would say, 'Then I am fasting this day.'" Abu Talha, Abu Hurayra,
Ibn 'Abbas and Hudhayfa also did this.
<P>
1824. It is related from Salama ibn al-Akwa', "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, sent a man to announce among people on the Day of
'Ashura', "Anyone who has eaten should complete the day fasting - or should
fast, and anyone who has not eaten should not eat.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: Someone fasting who wakes up in <I>janaba</I> </B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#11">1825</A>. It is related from 'A'isha and Umm Salama.
<P>
'Abdu'r-Rahman related to Marwan from 'A'isha and Umm Salama, "<I>Fajr</I>
used sometimes to find the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, in <I>janaba</I> from one of his wives. Then he performed
<I>ghusl</I> and fasted."
<P>
Marwan said to 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Harith, "I swear by Allah, you should
rebuke Abu Hurayra with this!" At that time Marwan was governor of Madina.
Abu Bakr said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman disliked hearing that." Then he made an
arrangement for us to meet at Dhu'l-Hulayfa where Abu Hurayra had some land.
'Abdu'r-Rahman said to Abu Hurayra, "I must mention something to you. If
it had not that Marwan made me take an oath on it I would not do so." So
he mentioned what 'A'isha and Umm Salama said. He said, "That is how al-Fadl
ibn 'Abbas related it."
<P>
Hammam and Ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar related from Abu Hurayra, "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded that the fast should be
broken," The first has a better <I>isnad</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: Someone fasting embracing his wife</B>
<P>
'A'isha said, "Her private parts are forbidden to him."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#18">1826</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said,"The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to kiss and embrace while he
was fasting. But he was the one among you most able to control himself."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "<I>Ma'rab</I> [20:18] means a need." Tawus said, "The one
without <I>irba</I> [cf Q 24:31] is stupid and has no need of women." Jabir
ibn Zayd said, "If he looks and has a seminal discharge, he should complete
his fast."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: Kissing for someone fasting</B>
<P>
Jabir ibn Zayd said, "If he looks and has a seminal emission, he completes
his fast."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#15">1827</A>. It is related from 'A'isha from the Prophet.
<P>
It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to kiss some of his wives when he was fasting."
Then she laughed.
<P>
1828. It is related from Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salama, that her mother
said, "Once while I was lying with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, under a woollen cover I started my menstrual period
and I slipped away to get my menstruation clothes. He said, 'What is the
matter? Have you started menstruating?" I said. 'Yes.' I lay down again with
him under the cover." She and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to perform <I>ghusl</I> from the same container.
He used to kiss her when he was fasting.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: The <I>ghusl</I> of someone fasting</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar moistened a garment and put it on while he was fasting. Ash-Sha'bi
went into the hammam. Ibn 'Abbas said, "There is no harm in tasting the pot
or something." Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm in someone fasting rinsing
out his mouth and cooling himself." Ibn Mas'ud said, "When one of you is
fasting, morning should find him with his hair oiled and combed." Anas said,
"I had a tub in which I could sit while I was fasting." It is mentioned that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to clean his teeth
[with siwak] while he was fasting. Ibn 'Umar said, "He cleaned his teeth
at the beginning and end of the day without swallowing his saliva." 'Ata'
said, "I do not say that saliva breaks the fast." Ibn Sirin said, "There
is no harm in using a moist siwak." He was told that it had a taste and replied,
"Water has a taste and yet you rinse your mouth out with it." Anas, al-Hasan
and Ibrahim did not see any harm in someone fasting using kohl.
<P>
1829. It is related that 'A'isha said, "<I>Fajr</I> sometimes found the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in <I>janaba</I> not because of
a dream. Then he had a <I>ghusl</I> and fasted."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#10">1830</A>. It is related from Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman,
"I went with my father and visited 'A'isha and she said, 'I testify that
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would sometimes
be in <I>janaba</I> in the morning due to sexual intercourse, not a wet dream,
and then he would fast,' Then we visited Umm Salama and she said something
similar."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: When someone fasting eats or drinks forgetfully</B>
<P>
'Ata' said, "If he snuffs water up his nose and it enters his throat, there
is no harm if he cannot get it out." Al-Hasan said, "If a fly enters his
throat, there is nothing against him." Al-Hasan and Mujahid said, "If he
has sexual intercourse forgetfully there is nothing against him."
<P>
1831. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "If he forgets and eats and drinks he should complete
his fast. Allah has fed him and let him drink."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: Moist and dry siwak for someone fasting</B>
<P>
It is mentioned that 'Amir ibn Rabi'a said, "I saw the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, cleaning his teeth while he was fasting too
many times to number or count." Abu Hurayra said from the Prophet*, "If it
were not that it would be hard for my community, I would command them to
use the siwak every time they do <I>wudu'</I>." The like of it is related
from Jabir and Zayd ibn Khalid from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace. He did not make any difference between a fasting person
and anyone else. 'A'isha said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Purification of the mouth is pleasing to the Lord." 'Ata'
and Qatada said, "He can swallow his saliva."
<P>
1832. It is reported that Humran said, "I saw 'Uthman performing <I>wudu'
</I>and he poured water over his hands three times. Then he cleaned his nose
by sniffing up water and blowing out. Then he washed his face three times
and he washed his right arm to the elbow three times and then his left arm
three times. Then he wiped his head and washed his right foot three times
and then his left foot three times. Then he said, 'I saw Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, doing <I>wudu'</I> like this w<I>udu'
</I>of mine.' Then he said, 'Whoever does <I>wudu</I>' like this and then
prays two <I>rak'ats</I> in which he does not become distracted will have
his past sins forgiven.'
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"When he does <I>wudu' </I>he should snuff water up his nose." He did not
make any difference between a fasting person and anyone else</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm in a fasting person using snuff if it does
not reach his throat or with his using kohl." 'Ata' said. "If he rinses his
mouth and then empties out the water from his mouth, it will not harm him
if he does not swallow his saliva and what is left in his mouth. He should
not chew gum. If he swallows the juice of the gum, I do not say that it breaks
the fast, but it is objected to. If he snuffs up water and the water enters
his throat, there is no harm in it because he cannot prevent that."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: If someone has sexual intercourse Ramadan</B>
<P>
It is mentioned from Abu Hurayra (<I>marfu'</I>), "Anyone who breaks the
fast for a day in Ramadan without excuse or illness, would not make it up
were he to fast for all time." Ibn Mas'ud said it. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab,
ash-Sha'bi, Ibn Jubayr, Ibrahim, Qatada and Hammad said, "He should complete
another day in its place."
<P>
1833. It is related that 'A'isha said, "A man came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said that he had been burned. The Prophet
asked, 'What has happened to you?' He said, 'I had sexual intercourse with
my wife in Ramadan.' A large basket [of dates] called an <I>'araq </I>was
brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said,
'Where is the burned one?' He said, 'Me.' He said, 'Give this away as
<I>sadaqa</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: When someone has sexual intercourse in Ramadan and has nothing and
is given <I>sadaqa</I>, he should do expiation for it.</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#28">1834</A>. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Once
while we were sitting with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, a man came up to him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, I am destroyed.'
He asked, "What is wrong?' He said, 'I had sexual intercourse with my wife
while I was fasting.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, &nbsp;asked, 'Can you find a slave to set free?' 'No,' replied
He asked, 'Can you fast for two consecutive months?' He said, 'No.' He said,
'Can you feed sixty poor people?' He answered, 'No.'" He said, "He stayed
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and while we were
there, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought
a basket of dates. (<I>'Araq</I> is the basket.) He asked, 'Where is the
questioner?' He said, 'Me.' He said, 'Take this and give it away as
<I>sadaqa</I>.' The man said, 'To one poorer than me, Messenger of Allah?
By Allah, there is no family between the two <I>harras</I> which is poorer
than the people of my household.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, smiled until his molars showed and then said, 'Feed it to your
family.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXI: Can someone who has sexual intercourse in Ramadan feed his family
as part of his expiation if they are needy?</B>
<P>
1835. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man came to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Someone had sexual intercourse
with his wife in Ramadan.' He said, 'Can you find the means to free a slave?'
He said, 'No.' He said, 'Are you able to fast two consecutive months?' He
said, 'No.' He said, 'Can you find the means to feed sixty poor people?'
He said, 'No.'" He said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, was brought a basket of dates. (It is a <I>zabil</I>.) He said, 'Feed
others with this.' He said, 'People more in need than us? There is no family
in any house between the <I>harras</I> more needy than us.' He said, 'Feed
it to your family.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXII: On cupping and vomiting in the case of someone fasting</B>
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra, "When someone vomits, he does not break his
fast. He is expelling something and not taking anything in." It is mentioned
from Abu Hurayra, "He breaks the fast," but the first opinion is sounder.
Ibn 'Abbas and 'Ikrima said, "Fasting is from what comes in, not from what
goes out."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar used to be cupped during the fast and then he abandoned it and
had himself cupped at night. Abu Musa was cupped at night. It is mentioned
from Sa'd, that Zayd ibn Arqam and Umm Salama were cupped while fasting.
Bukayr said from Umm 'Alqama, "We used to be cupped in the presence of 'A'isha
and she did not object. It is related from al-Hasan <I>marfu'</I> from more
than one person, "The cupper and the one cupped both break the fast." 'Ayyash
related to me the like of it from 'Abdu'l-A'la from Yunus from al-Hasan.
He was asked, "From the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?'
He said, "Yes." Then he said, "Allah knows best."
<P>
1836. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was cupped while he was in <I>ihram</I> and cupped while
he was fasting.
<P>
1837. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was cupped while he was fasting."
<P>
1838. It is related from Thabit al-Bunani, "Anas ibn Malik was asked, 'Do
you dislike cupping for someone fasting?' He said, 'No, except if it will
cause weakness.'" Shababa added, "Shu'ba related the observance of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIII: Fasting and breaking the fast when travelling</B>
<P>
1839. It is related that Ibn Abi Awfa said, "We were with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and he said
to a man, 'Get down and mix some <I>sawiq</I> for me' He said, 'Messenger
of Allah, the sun!' He said, 'Get down and mix some <I>sawiq</I> for me.'
He said, 'Messenger of Allah, the sun!' He said, 'Get down and mix some
<I>sawiq</I> for me.' He mixed it for him and he drank and then gestured
with his hand like this and then said, 'When you see the night advancing
from here, then the faster can break his fast.'"
<P>
Jarir and Abu Bakr ibn 'Abbas corroborated it from ash-Shaybani from Ibn
Abi Awfa who said, "I was with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, on a journey."
<P>
1840. It is related from 'A'isha that Hamza ibn 'Amr al-Aslami said, "Messenger
of Allah, I fast continuously."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#24">1841</A>. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that Hamza ibn 'Amr
al-Aslami asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Should
I fast while travelling?" He used to fast a lot. He said, "Fast if you wish
and break the fast if you wish."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIV: If someone fasts some days in Ramadan and then sets off on a
journey</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#21">1842</A>. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set off for Makka in Ramadan
and continued fasting. When he reached al-Kadid, he broke his fast and the
rest of the people broke their fast."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "Al-Kadid is a watering place between 'Usfan and Qudayd."
<P>
1843. It is related that Abu'd-Darda' said, "We went out with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on one of his journeys
on a day so hot that a man would put his hand over his head because of the
intensity of the heat. None of us was fasting except for the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Ibn Rawaha."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXV: The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
to someone who was being shaded when the heat was intense, "Fasting on a
journey is not part of piety."</B>
<P>
1844. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on a journey and he saw a crowd
and a man who was being shaded. He asked, 'What is this?' They replied, 'Someone
who is fasting.' He said, 'Fasting on a journey is not part of piety.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVI: The Companions of the Prophet did not find fault with one another
either for fasting or for breaking the fast</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#23">1845</A>. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said,
"We used to travel with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and those fasting did not find fault those not fasting nor did those not
fasting find fault with those fasting."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: Someone breaking his fast on a journey in such a way that people
will see him</B>
<P>
1846. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went out from Madina to Makka and fasted until
he reached 'Usfan. Then he called for water and raised it in his hand so
that the people would see him and ceased fasting until he reached Makka.
That was in Ramadan." Ibn 'Abbas used to say, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, fasted and broke his fast. Whoever wishes
to can fast and whoever wishes to can break his fast."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVIII: <I>"For those who are able to fast, the reparation is to feed
the poor." </I>(2:184)</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar and Salama ibn al-Akwa' said that this is abrogated by <I>"The
month of Ramadan is the one in which the Qur'an was sent down as guidance
for mankind, with Clear Signs containing guidance and discrimination. Any
of you who are resident for the month should fast it. But any of you who
are ill or on a journey should fast a number of other days. Allah desires
ease for you; He does not desire difficulty for you. You should complete
the number of days and proclaim Allah's Greatness for the guidance He has
given you so that perhaps you will show thanks." </I>(2:185)
<P>
1847. It is related from Ibn Abi Layla from the Companions of Muhammad, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, that Ramadan was revealed and it was
hard for them. So all those who were able to feed a poor person every day
would abandon the fast. They were allowed to do that. Then that was abrogated
by, "that you should fast is better for you," so they were ordered to fast.
<P>
1848. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar recited, <I>"the reparation
is to feed the poor" </I>and he said that it was abrogated.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: When to make up Ramadan</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "There is no harm in dividing up the days going by the words
of Allah Almighty, <I>"a number of other days."</I>
<P>
Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "The fasting of the ten should not be undertaken
until Ramadan has been made up."
<P>
Ibrahim said, "If someone fails to make up until the next Ramadan comes,
he should fast them both." He did not think that it was necessary to feed
anyone.
<P>
It is reported (<I>mursal</I>) from Abu Hurayra and Ibn 'Abbas that he should
feed. Allah does not mention feeding. He says, <I>"A number of other days."</I>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#54">1849</A>. It is related that 'A'isha was heard to
say, "Occasionally I owed some days of fasting from Ramadan and was only
able to make them up in Sha'ban."
<P>
Yahya said, "She was busy with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, or because of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
<P>
<B>XL: Menstruating women do not fast or pray</B>
<P>
Abu'z-Zinad said, "It happens frequently that the <I>sunan</I> and some aspects
of the truth are contrary to what people might think should be the case.
The Muslims have no choice but to follow them. An instance of this is the
fact that menstruating women make up the fast but do not make up the prayer."
<P>
1850. It is related that Abu Sa'id said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Is it not true that when a woman menstruates,
she does not pray or fast? That is a loss in her <I>deen</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLI: Someone who dies owing some fasting</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "If thirty men fast one day for him, that is enough."
<P>
1851. It is related from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone dies owing some fasting, his guardian
should fast on his behalf."
<P>
Ibn Wahb corroborated it from 'Amr. Yahya ibn Ayyub narrated it from Ibn
Abi Ja'far.
<P>
1852. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A man came to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, my mother
has died and she still owes a month's fast. Should I make it up for her?'
He said, 'Yes. Debts due to Allah have more right to be settled.'
<P>
Sulayman said that al-Hakam and Salama said, "We were all sitting round when
Muslim related this hadith." They said, "We heard Mujahid mention this from
Ibn 'Abbas."
<P>
It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that a woman said to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, "My sister has died."

Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and he was fasting. When

<I>sawiq</I> for us' He said, 'Messenger of Allah, won't you wait until
nightfall?' He said, 'Get down and mix some <I>sawiq</I> for us.' He said,
'Messenger of Allah, won't you wait until nightfall?' He said, 'Get down
and mix some <I>sawiq</I> for us.' He said, 'It is still daylight.' He said,
'Get down and mix some sawiq for us.' He got down and mixed it for them.

When you see the night advancing from here, then people fasting should break
their fast.'"

Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent someone on the morning of 'Ashura'
to the villages of the Ansar saying, 'Anyone who is not fasting this morning
should fast the rest of the day, and anyone who is fasting this morning should
continue fasting.'" She said, "After that we used to fast and made our boys
fast. We made woollen toys for them. If any of them cried for food, we would
give them those until it was time for fast-breaking."
<P>

<I>wisal</I>. They said, "But you fast continously.' He said, "I am not like
you. I am fed and given to drink."
<P>
1862. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri heard the Prophet, may Allah

they refused to stop fasting continously, he fasted continously with them
for a day and then another day and then they saw the crescent moon. He said,
'If it had been longer, I would have made you fast longer,' as if it was
a punishment for them for refusing to stop."

need of this world.' Abu'd-Darda' came and made some food for him. Salman
said, 'Eat.' He said, 'I am fasting.' Salman said, 'I will not eat until
you eat.'" He said, "He ate. In the night, Abu'd-Darda' went to stand in
prayer and Salman said, 'Sleep!' and he slept. Then he got up again and Salman
said, 'Sleep!' At the end of the night, Salman said, 'Now get up and we will
pray.' Salman said to him, 'Your Lord has rights over you and your self has
rights over you, so give those with rights their right.' Abu'd-Darda' came

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, fast for an entire month
except for Ramadan and I did not see him fast more than during Sha'ban."
<P>

and grant him peace, did not fast in any month more than Sha'ban. He used

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to not fast in a month until
we thought that he would not fast for any of it and he would fast until we

wanted to see him fasting during a month, I could see him, or not fasting,
I could see him, or standing in prayer in the night I could see him or sleeping
I could see him. I never touched any raw silk or silk softer than the palm
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, nor smelt
any musk or scent more fragrant than that of the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace*.'"

of Allah.' He said, 'Do not do it. Fast and break the fast. Pray and sleep.
Your body has rights over you. Your eyes have rights over you. Your wife
has rights over you. Your guest has rights over you. It is enough for you
to fast three days every month and since every good deed is multiplied by
ten that is equivalent to fasting the whole year.' But I remained obdurate
so it was made hard for me. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I have the strength
for it.' He said, 'Then fast the fast of the Prophet of Allah, Da'ud, peace
be upon him, and do not do more than that.' I said, 'What was the fast of
the Prophet of Allah, Da'ud, peace be upon him?' He said, 'Half the year.'"

live. I said to him, 'I did say it, may my father and mother be your ransom.'
He said, 'You will not be able to do it. So fast and break the fast, and
pray and sleep. Fast three days of the month and since every good action
is multiplied by ten that will be like fasting all the time.' I said. 'I
can do more than that.' He said, 'Then fast one day and break the fast the
next. That is the fast of Da'ud, peace be upon him, and it is the best fast.'
I said, 'I can do more than that.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'There is nothing better than that.'"

about you fasting and not breaking the fast and your praying? Fast and break
the fast. Pray and sleep. Your eyes have rights over you and your self and
your family have rights over you.' He said, 'I am strong enough to do it.'
He said, 'Then fast the fast of Da'ud, peace be upon him.' He asked, 'How
do I do that?' He said, 'He fasted one day and did not fast the next and
he did not run away when he met the enemy.' He said, 'How will I have this,
Prophet of Allah?' 'Ata' said, "I do not know how 'fasting all the time'
got mentioned?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,

him and grant him peace, said to me, 'Do you really fast all the time and
pray all night?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'If you do that, it will make your
eyes weak and your self tired. Someone who fasts all the time does not fast
at all. Fasting three days is fasting the entire year.' I said. 'I can do
more than that.' He said, 'Then fast the fast of Da'ud, peace be upon him.
He used to fast one day and break the fast the next and he did not run away
when he met the enemy.'"

me. I offered him a leather cushion stuffed with palm fibre, but he sat on
the ground. The cushion remained between me and him. He said, 'Are not three
days every month enough for you?'" He said, 'I said, 'Messenger of Allah!'
He said, 'Five?' I said, 'Messenger of Allah!' He said, 'Seven?' I said,
'Messenger of Allah!' He said, 'Nine?' I said, 'Messenger of Allah!' He said,
'Eleven?' Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'There is no fast superior to the fast of Da'ud, peace be upon him: half
the year. Fast one day and break the fast the next.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LIX: Fasting the nights of the full moon: the 13th, 14th and 15th</B>
<P>
1880. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "My friend , may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, ordered me to do three things: to fast three days every
month, to pray the two <I>rak'ats </I>of <I>Duha</I> and to do the
<I>witr</I> before going to sleep."
<P>
<P>
<B>LX: Someone visiting some people and not breaking his fast with them</B>
<P>
1881. It is related from Anas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, visited Umm Sulaym and she brought him some dates and ghee. He
said, 'Put back your ghee into its vessel and your dates into their bag.
I am fasting.' Then he went to a corner of her house and prayed a supererogatory
prayer and made supplication for Umm Sulaym and her household. Umm Sulaym
said, 'Messenger of Allah, I have a private request.' He said, 'What is it?'
She said, 'For your servant, Anas.' He did not leave out any good thing in
this world or the Next without praying for it for me, 'O Allah! Give him
with wealth and children and bless him.' I have the greatest wealth of any
of the Ansar and my daughter Umayna told me that some one hundred and twenty
of my offspring had been buried before al-Hajjaj came to Basra."
<P>
Humayd related that he heard Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace.
<P>
[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf came to Basra in 75 AH when Anas was more than 80 years
old. Anas died in 83 AH when he was close to 100.]
<P>
<P>
<B>LXI: Fasting at the end of the month</B>
<P>
1882. It is related from 'Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, asked him or asked a man while 'Imran was listening,
"So-and-so! Have you fasted the end of this month?" He said, "I thought that
he said, 'in other words, Ramadan.'" The man said, "No, Messenger of Allah."
He said, "When you break the fast, then fast two more days."
<P>
As-Salt did not say [in his transmission], "I thought that he said, 'in other
words, Ramadan.'"
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said and Thabit said from Mutarrif from 'Imran from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "from the end of Sha'ban?"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXII: Fasting the day of Jumu'a (Friday).</B>
<P>
If someone starts the day fasting on the day of<I> Jumu'a </I>he should break
his fast. This means when he did not fast the day before it and does not
intend to fast the day after it.
<P>
1883. It is related that Muhammad ibn 'Abbas said, "I asked Jabir, 'Did the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbid fasting on the day
of Jumu'a?' He said, 'Yes.'" Others add that Abu 'Asim said, "He means fasting
Friday on its own."
<P>
1884. It is related that Abu Hurayra heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, say, "None of you should fast on the day of <I>Jumu'a
</I>unless he fasts a day before or after it."
<P>
1885. It is related from Juwayriya bint al-Harith that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, visited her on the day of Jumu'a while she
was fasting. He asked, "Did you fast yesterday?" She replied, "No." He asked,
"Do you intend to fast tomorrow?" She answered, "No." He said, "Then break
the fast."
<P>
It is related from Abu Ayyub that Juwayriya related it to him and he commanded
her to break the fast.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIII: Is it permitted to single out certain days?</B>
<P>
1886. It is related from 'Alqama, "I asked 'A'isha, 'Did the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, choose certain days?' She
said, 'No, but his action was constant. Which of you can do what the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, could do?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIV: Fasting on the day of 'Arafa</B>
<P>
1887. It is related from Umm al-Fadl bint al-Harith, "Some people were
disagreeing in her presence on the day of 'Arafa about whether the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was fasting, Some said, 'He is fasting,'
and others said, 'He is not fasting.'". So she sent a vessel of milk to him
while he was standing still, mounted on his camel and he drank it."
<P>
1888. It is related from Maymuna that the people were unsure about whether
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was fasting on the
day of 'Arafa and she sent him some milk while he was standing at the Mawqif.
He drank some of it while the people were looking.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXV: Fasting on the Day of <I>Fitr</I></B>
<P>
1889. It is related that Abu 'Ubayd, the client of Ibn Azhar, said, "I was
present at the <I>'Id </I>with 'Umar ibn al-Khattab and he said, 'The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;forbade fasting on these two
days: the day of your <I>Fitr</I> (breaking) of your fast and the other day
on which you eat from your sacrifices.'"
<P>
1890. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade fasting on <I>al-Fitr</I> and the
Day of Sacrifice and the <I>samma'</I> style of wrapping (wrapping yourself
in a garment in such a way that you cannot put your hands out) and a man
wearing a single cloth sitting with his legs drawn up when none of it was
covering his private parts, and praying after <I>Subh</I> and <I>'Asr</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVI: Fasting on the Day of Sacrifice</B>
<P>
1891. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Forbidden are two fasts and two
kinds of sales: (fasting) <I>al-Fitr </I>and the Day of Sacrifice and
<I>mulamasa</I> (a sale which is concluded when an article is touched) and
<I>munabadha</I> (when an article is thrown to a buyer)."
<P>
1892. It is related that Ziyad ibn Jubayr said, "A man came to Ibn 'Umar
and said, 'A man vowed to fast one day (and he said, 'I think that he said
Monday') and that day happened to be the <I>'Id</I>. Ibn 'Umar said, 'Allah
has commanded that vows be fulfilled and the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, forbade fasting this day.'"
<P>
[So he would have to make it up after the<I> 'Id </I>since the prohibition
takes precedence.]
<P>
1893. It is related that Qaza'a said, "I heard Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, who had
gone on twelve expeditions with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, say, 'I heard four things from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, which delighted me. He said, "A woman should not travel
two days except with her husband or a <I>mahram</I>; there is no fasting
on two days: the Day of <I>Fitr</I> and that of <I>al-Adha</I>; there is
no prayer after two prayers: after <I>Subh</I> until the sun rises and after<I>
'Asr </I>until the sun sets; and there is no journey except to three mosques:
the Masjid al-Haram, the Masjid al-Aqsa and my mosque."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVII: Fasting on the Days of <I>Tashriq</I></B>
<P>
Hisham said, "My father reported to me that 'A'isha used to fast the days
of Mina and that her father used to fast them."
<P>
1894. It is related that 'A'isha and Ibn 'Umar said, "No one was allowed
to fast on the days of Tashriq except someone who could not find a sacrifice."
<P>
1895. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "Fasting is for someone doing <I>Hajj
at-Tamattu' </I>(<I>'umra</I> with hajj) up to the day of 'Arafa. If he cannot
find a sacrifice and fasts, he can fast the days of Mina."
<P>
The like of it is related from 'A'isha and it is corroborated by Ibrahim
ibn Sa'd from Ibn Shihab.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVIII: Fasting on the Day of 'Ashura'</B>
<P>
1896. It is related from the father of Salim that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone wishes, he can fast 'Ashura."
<P>
1897. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to command that the day of 'Ashura' be
fasted. When fasting Ramadan was made obligatory, whoever wished could fast
it and whoever wished need not fast it."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#33">1898</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Quraysh
used to fast the day of 'Ashura' in the time of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used also to
fast it. When he came to Madina, he fasted it and commanded that it be fasted.
When Ramadan became obligatory, he stopped fasting the day of 'Ashura'. Whoever
wished could fast it and whoever wished could leave it."
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#34">1899</A>. It is related from Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman
that he heard Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan say on the minbar on the day of 'Ashura'
in the year he went on hajj, "O people of Madina! Where are your men of
knowledge? I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, say, 'This is the day of 'Ashura' and Allah has not prescribed
its fasting for you, but I am fasting. Whoever wishes can fast it and whoever
wishes need not fast.'"
<P>
1900. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came to Madina and saw the Jews fasting the day of 'Ashura'
and said, 'What is this?' They said, 'This is a holy day. This is the day
when Allah rescued the Children of Israel from their enemy and so Musa fasted
it.' He said, 'We have more right to Musa than you.' So he fasted it and
commanded that it be fasted.'"
<P>
1901. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The day of 'Ashura' was considered
a festival day by the Jews. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'You should fast it.'"
<P>
1902. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I did not see the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, consider the fasting of any one day
better than any another except for this day, the day of 'Ashura', and this
month, i.e. the month of Ramadan."
<P>
1903. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, commanded a man from Aslam to announce among
the people, 'Whoever has eaten should fast the rest of the day. Whoever has
not eaten should fast. Today is the day of 'Ashura'.'"

<B>I: The excellence of someone who prays at night in Ramadan</B>
<P>
1904. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say about Ramadan, '"Anyone who
prays in Ramadan motivated by belief and in expectation of the reward will
be forgiven his past wrong actions.'"
<P>
1905. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who prays in Ramadan motivated
by belief and in expectation of the reward will be forgiven his past wrong
actions."
<P>
Ibn Shihab said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, died people were doing that and then it remained the practice
during the khalifate of Abu Bakr and the beginning of the khalifate of 'Umar.
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#t3">1906</A>. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn
'Abdu'l-Qari said, "One night in Ramadan I went out with 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
to the mosque and people were separated in different groups. One man was
praying on his own and another man with a group behind him following his
prayer. 'Umar said, 'I think that it would be better for all these people
to join together behind one reciter.' So he decided to gather them behind
Ubayy ibn Ka'b. Then another night I went out with him again and all the
people were praying behind one reciter. 'Umar said, 'This is an excellent
innovation! But the one they sleep through is better than the one they are
praying,' meaning prayer in the last part of the night. People used to stand
in prayer during the first part of the night."
<P>
1907. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray, and that
was in Ramadan.
<P>
1908. It is related from 'A'isha, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went out in the middle of the night and prayed in
the mosque and some men began to follow his prayer. The following morning
they talked about it and the next night some more people prayed together
with his prayer. The third night there were many people in the mosque and
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out and prayed
and they followed his prayer. on the fourth night, the mosque was not large
enough to hold them, but he only came out for the <I>Subh</I> prayer. When
he finished Fajr, he faced the people and did the <I>tashahhud</I>. Then
he said, 'As for what follows, your position was not hidden from me, but
I was afraid that it (the night prayer) would become obligatory for you and
you would be unable to do it.' When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, died that was how things stood."
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#9">1909</A>. It is related that Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman
reported that he asked 'A'isha, "What was the prayer of the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in Ramadan like?" She said,
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, never did
more than eleven <I>rak'ats</I> in Ramadan or any other time. He would pray
four <I>rak'ats </I>- do not ask about their excellence and length - and
then he would pray four - and do not ask about their excellence and length
- and then he would pray three." She said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah,
do you sleep before the <I>witr</I>?' He said, ''A'isha, my eyes sleep but
my heart does not sleep.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The excellence of the Night of Power</B>
<P>
Allah Almighty says<I>, "Truly We sent it down on the Night of Power. And
what will convey to you what the Night of Power is? The Night of Power is
better than a thousand months. In it the angels and the Spirit descend by
their Lord's authority with every ordinance. It is Peace &#150; until the
coming of the dawn." </I>(97)
<P>
Ibn 'Uyayna said, "The <I>ma</I> in the Qur'an in<I> 'ma adraka' </I>indicates
that He has informed him, and the <I>ma</I> in <I>'ma yudrika' </I>that has
not informed him."
<P>
1910. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who fasts in Ramadan motivated by belief
and in anticipation of the reward will be forgiven his past wrong actions.
Anyone who spends the Night of Power in prayer motivated by belief and in
anticipation of the reward will be forgiven his past wrong actions."
<P>
Sulayman ibn Kathir corroborated it from az-Zuhri.
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Looking for the Night of Power during the last seven days</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw6.html#i14">1911</A>. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that some
of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
were shown in a dream that the Night of Power is during the last seven days.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I
think that your dreams agree about the last seven. Those who want to look
for it, should look for it in the last seven."
<P>
1912. It is related that Abu Salama said, "I asked Abu Sa'id, who was a friend
of mine, and he said, 'We did <I>i'tikaf </I>with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, during the middle ten days of Ramadan. He
came out on the morning of the twentieth and addressed us, saying, "I was
shown the Night of Power and then I was made to forget it (or I forgot it).
So look for it on the odd nights of the last ten. I dreamed that I was
prostrating in water and mud. Those who did<I> i'tikaf </I>with me should
continue." We continued and did not see the slightest whisp of a cloud in
the sky. A cloud came and it rained until the roof of the mosque, which was
made of palm-fronds, was soaked. The <I>iqama</I> for the prayer was given
and I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prostrating in water and mud so that I could see the marks of the mud on
his forehead.'"

Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to do <I>i'tikaf </I>during the
middle ten days of Ramadan. On the evening of the twentieth night when the
twenty-first was approaching, he would return to his home and those who were
doing <I>i'tikaf </I>with him returned as well. One month when he was doing<I>
i'tikaf </I>he addressed the people on the night when he usually returned
and instructed them as Allah willed. He said, 'I have been doing <I>i'tikaf
</I>for these ten days and it has become clear to me that I should do
<I>i'tikaf </I>for the last ten as well. Those who have been doing<I> i'tikaf
</I>with me should remain in their place of <I>i'tikaf</I>. I was shown this
night and then I was made to forget it, so look for it during the last ten
and look for it on each odd night. I saw myself prostrating in water and
mud.' That night it poured with rain and the mosque leaked onto the place
where the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed. I saw
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with my
own eyes and looked at him when he left from <I>Subh</I>. His face was covered
with mud and water."
<P>
1915. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Search for it."

said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came
out to tell us about the Night of Power. There were two Muslim men quarrelling
with one another. He said, 'I came out to tell you about the Night of Power
and these two here were quarrelling and because of that knowledge of it has
been taken away. It may be that that is better for you. Search for it on
the twenty-seventh, twenty-ninth and twenty-fifth of the month."

doing <I>i'tikaf </I>and then, when it came to the night of the twenty-first,
which was the night before the morning when he would have normally have finished
his <I>i'tikaf</I>, he said, "Those who have done<I> i'tikaf </I>with me
should continue doing <I>i'tikaf </I>for the last ten days. I was shown this
night in a dream and then I was made to forget it. I saw myself prostating
the following morning in water and mud. Look for it during the last ten days,
and look for it on the odd nights.' It rained that night and the mosque,
which had a roof, leaked. With my own eyes I saw the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with the marks of water and mud
on his forehead on the morning of the twenty-first."

to do <I>i'tikaf </I>for one night in the Masjid al-Haram." He said, "Fulfil
your vow."

<P>
<B>VI: The<I> i'tikaf </I>of women</B>
<P>

and grant him peace, used to do <I>i'tikaf </I>during the last ten days of
Ramadan and I used to set up a tent for him and he would pray <I>Subh</I>
and then go into it." Hafsa asked 'A'isha for permission to set up a tent
and she gave her permission and she set up a tent. When Zaynab bint Jahsh
saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, saw the tents and said, "What is this?" He was informed
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do you think
that they intended piety by these tents?" So he left <I>i'tikaf</I> that
month and then did <I>i'tikaf </I>for ten days in Shawwal.

Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reported to him that she
went to visit the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
