<p><b>I. The beginning of the revelation to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was the true dream
</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>	6581. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "The beginning [of the revelation] to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took the form of the true dream in sleep. Whenever he had a dream, it was clear like the break of day. He used to go to Hira' and there he devoted himself to worship for a number of nights. He took provisions with him for that. Then he would return to Khadija and take provisions for the like of that again. This continued until the Truth came to him suddenly while he was in the Cave of Hira'. The angel came to him in it and said, 'Read!'
</p>
<p>"The Prophet said, 'I said, "I do not read." He seized me and squeezed me until all the strength went out of me and then released me and said, "Read!" I said, "I do not read." Then he seized me and squeezed me a second time until all the strength when out of me and then released me and said, "Read!" I said, "I do not read." Then he seized me and squeezed me a third time and then released me, and then he said, <i>"Read in the name of your Lord who created man from a blood clot. Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous. He Who taught the use of the Pen"</i> and the <i>ayats</i> up to <i>"Taught man which he knew not."</i> (96:1-5)'</p>

<p>	"He returned with that and his heart was quaking. He went to Khadija and said, 'Wrap me up! Wrap me up!' They wrapped him up until the state of terror had left him and then he said to Khadija, 'What is wrong with me?" He told her what had happened and said, 'I am afraid for myself.' She said, 'No, it is good news. By Allah, Allah would never bring disgrace upon you. You maintain ties of kinship, speak the truth, bear people's burdens, give hospitality to your guests and help those who have been afflicted by calamities.'
</p>
<p>	"Then Khadija then went with him to Waraqa ibn Nawfal ibn Asad ibn 'Abdu'l-'Uzza ibn Qusayy, Khadija's cousin (the son of her father's brother), who had become Christian during the <i>Jahiliyya</i>. He could write in Arabic and wrote as much of the Gospel in Arabic as Allah willed. He was an old man who had gone blind. Khadija said to him, 'Cousin! Listen to your nephew.' Waraqa asked him, 'Nephew, what have you seen?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told him what he had seen. Waraqa said to him, 'This is the Namus [Jibril] which Allah sent to Musa. I wish that I were still young. I wish I might still be alive when your people drive you out!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Will they drive me out?' Waraqa said, 'Yes, no man has brought anything similar to what you have brought without being treated with hostility. If I am still alive on that day, I will give you my strong support.'</p>

<p>"Shortly after that, Waraqa died and there was a pause in the revelation until the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, became so sad that we heard that his sorrow several times made him want to throw himself off the tops of the mountains. Whenever he reached the peak of a mountain, Jibril would appear to him and say, 'Muhammad, you are truly the Messenger of Allah.' So his agitation was stilled by that and he would be at peace and then would return home. When the gap in the revelation was long for him, and he was moved to act as before. When he reached the peak of he mountain. Jibril would appear before him and say the like of that to him."</p>

<p>Ibn 'Abbas said that<i> "(faliq al-isbagh) It is He Who splits the sky at dawn,"</i> (6:96) is the light of the sun in the day and the light of the moon at night.</p>

<p><b>II. The dreams of the righteous</b></p>

<p>Allah says,<i> "Allah has confirmed His Messenger's vision with truth: 'You will enter the Masjid al-Haram in safety, Allah willing, shaving your heads and cutting your hair without any fear.' He knew what you did not know and ordained, in place of this, an imminent victory."</i> (48:27)</p>


<p>6582. Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A good dream of a righteous man is one forty-sixth part of prophethood."</p>

<p><b>III. The dream comes from Allah</b></p>

<p>6583. Abu Salama heard Abu Qatada say that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The true dream is from Allah and the bad dream (<i>hulm</i>) is from Shaytan."</p>
<p>6584. 'Abdullah ibn Khabbab related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "When one of you sees a dream that he likes, it is from Allah and so he should praise Allah and talk about it. When he sees other than which he dislikes, it is from Shaytan and he should seek refuge from its evil and not mention it to anyone. It will not harm him."</p>

<p><b>IV. The true dream is one forty-sixth part of Prophethood</b></p>

<p>6585. Abu Salama related from Abu Qatada that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The true dream is from Allah and the bad dream is from Shaytan. When one of you has a bad dream, he should seek refuge from it and spit to his left side. It will not harm him."</p>

<p>The like of it is reported from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Qatada from his father...</p>

<p>6586. Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik from 'Ubada ibn as-Samit that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The dream of the believer is one forty-sixth part of prophethood."</p>

<p>6587. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The dream of the believer is one forty-sixth part of prophethood."</p>

<p>Shu'ayb related it from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.</p>

<p>6588. 'Abdullah ibn Khabbab related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "The true dream is one forty-sixth part of prophethood."</p>

<p><b>V. Good news</b></p>
<p>
6589. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  say, 'Only good signs remains of prophethood.' They asked, 'What are good signs?' He answered, 'The true dream.'"
</p>
<p><b>VI. Yusuf's dream</b></p>

<p>	The words of the Almighty, <i>"When Yusuf told his father, 'Father! I saw eleven bright stars, and the sun and moon as well. I saw them all prostrate in front of me.' He said, 'My son, don't tell your brothers your dream lest they devise some scheme to injure you, Shaytan is a clear-cut enemy to man. Accordingly your Lord will pick you out and teach you the true meaning of events and perfectly fulfil His blessing on you as well as on the family of Ya'qub as He fulfilled it perfectly before upon your forebears, Ibrahim and Ishaq. Most certainly your Lord is Knowing, Wise.'"</i> (12:4-6)</p>
<p>	His words, <i>"My father, truly this is now the interpretation of the dream I had. My Lord has made it all come true; and He was kind to me by letting me out of prison and brought you from the desert when Shaytan had caused dissent between me and my brothers. My Lord is kind to anyone He wills. He is indeed All-Knowing and All-Wise. My Lord, You have granted power to me on earth and taught me the true meaning of events. Originator of the heavens and earth, You are my Friend in this world and the Next. So take me as a Muslim at my death and join me to the people who are righteous."</i> (12:100-101)</p>
<p>	Abu 'Abdullah said, "<i>Fatir, al-Badi', al-Mubdi', al-Bari</i> and<i> al-Khaliq</i> all mean the same thing." Abu 'Abdullah said that <i>badi'a</i> is from <i>badw</i>.
</p>
<p><b>VII. The dream of Ibrahim, peace be upon him</b></p>

<p>	The words of the Almighty, <i>"When he was of an age to work with him, he said, 'My son, I saw in a dream that I must sacrifice you. What do you think about this?' He said, 'Do as you are ordered, father.Allah willing, you will find me resolute.' Then when they had both submitted and he had lain him face down on the ground, We called out to him, 'Ibrahim! you have discharged your vision.' That is how We recompense good-doers."</i> (37:102-105)</p>
<p>	Mujahid said that "<i>aslama</i>" means "They submitted to what they had been commanded" "<i>Tallahu</i>" means: "He placed his face on the ground."</p>

<p><b>VIII. When several people have the same dream</b></p>

<p>6590. Salim ibn 'Abdullah related from Ibn 'Umar that some people had a dream that the Night of Power was in the last seven days and that some people had a dream that it was in the last ten days. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Look for it in the last seven days."</p>

<p><b>IX. The dreams of prisoners, deviants and idolaters</b></p>

<p>His words, <i>"Two servants entered prison along with him. One said, 'I dreamt that I was pressing grapes.' The other said, 'I dreamt I carried bread upon my head and birds were eating it. Tell us the true meaning of these dreams. We see that you 're one of the righteous.' He said, 'No meal to feed you will arrive before I have informed you what they mean. That is part of what my Lord taught me. For I have left the religion of a people who clearly have no faith in Allah and are unbelievers about the world to come. I hold fast to the creed of my forebears, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Ya'qub. We do not associate anything with Allah. And that is how Allah has favoured us and all mankind, but most do not give thanks. My fellow-prisoners, are many lords better, or Allah, the only One, the Conqueror? What you serve apart from Him are only names which you and your forefathers have made up. There is no mandate for them from Allah. Allah alone is qualified to judge. His order is to worship none but Him. That is in truth the straight and upright deen, but most of mankind simply do not know. My fellow-captives, one of you will serve his lord with wine, the other of you will be crucified and birds will eat his head. The thing you asked about is foreordained.' He said to the one of them he knew was saved, 'Please mention me when you are with your lord,' but Shaytan made him forget to remind his lord, and so he stayed in prison for several years. The King declared, 'I dreamt of seven fat cows which seven thin ones ate and seven green ears of wheat and seven others which were dry. O counsellors! Explain my dream to me if you are those who can interpret visions!' They said, 'A jumbled mass of mixed-up dreams! We do not know the meaning of such things.' The one of them who had been saved then said, remembering after a period, 'I will tell you what it signifies, so send me out.' 'O truthful Yusuf, tell us of seven fat cows which seven thin ones ate and seven green ears of wheat and seven others which were dry so that I can return to them and let them know.' He said, 'Sow for seven years in the normal way and leave that which you harvest in the ear except for a small amount from which you eat. Then after that seven hard years will arrive in which you can eat from what you set aside for them, except for a little which you store. Then after that another year will come in which the people will be helped by rain in plenty and when they once more will press.' The King said, 'Bring him to me straight away!' but when the envoy came to him, he said, 'Go back to your master...'"</i> (12:36-50)</p>
<p>	<i>Addakara</i> is Form VIII from the verb <i>dhakara</i>. <i>Umma</i> is a generation.  It is read instead as '<i>amahin</i>', which means forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Ibn 'Abbas said, "They pressed grapes and oil." <i>Tuhsinuna</i> means 'to store'.</p>

<p>6591. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab and Abu 'Ubayd reported from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If I had remained in prison as long as Yusuf remained and then the summoner had come to me, I would have responded to him."</p>

<p><b>X. Someone who sees the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in a dream</b></p>

<p>6592. Abu Salama related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Anyone who sees me in a dream will see me awake. Shaytan does not take my form.'"</p>

<p>Abu 'Abdullah said that Ibn Sirin said, "If he sees him in his actual form."</p>

<p>6593. Thabit al-Bunani related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who has seen me in a dream has seen me. Shaytan does not take my form. The dream of the believer is one forty-sixth part of prophethood."</p>

<p>6594. Abu Salama related from Abu Qatada that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The true dream is from Allah and the bad dream is from Shaytan. If anyone sees something he dislikes, he should spit three times to his left side and seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan. It will not harm him. Shaytan cannot take on my appearance."</p>

<p>6595. Abu Salama said that Abu Qatada said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever sees me has truly seen me."</p>

<p>Yunus and the nephew of az-Zuhri corroborated that.</p>

<p>6596. 'Abdullah ibn Khabbab related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Whoever sees me has truly seen me. Shaytan does not take my form."
</p>
<p><b>XI. Night dreams</b></p>

<p>	Samura related it.</p>

<p>6597. Muhammad related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I have been given the keys to [the use of] words and helped by terror. While I was asleep last night, the keys of the treasures of the earth were brought and placed in my hand."</p>

<p>	Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has departed and know you have taken them."</p>

<p>6598. Nafi' related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "One night I dreamt that I was at the Ka'ba. I dreamt of a man with brownish skin, like the best brownish skin you might see among men; his hair reached between his shoulders, and it was the best you might see. It was combed and dripping with water. He was leaning on two men or on the shoulders of two men, peforming <i>tawaf</i> of the House. I asked, 'Who is this?' I was told, 'The Messiah son of Maryam.' There was a man with very curly hair, blind in the right eye, which was like a protruding grape. I asked, 'Who is this?' I was told, 'The Dajjal, the false Messiah.'"</p>
<p>
6599. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah related that Ibn 'Abbas reported about a man who came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "I had a dream last night," and the hadith proceeds.</p>

<p>	Sulayman ibn Kathir, the nephew of az-Zuhri, and Sufyan ibn Husayn corroborated it with the isnad going back to the Prophet. </p>
<p>	Az-Zubaydi said it is from az-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah from Ibn 'Abbas or Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.</p>
<p>	Az-Zuhri said that Abu Hurayra related it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Ma'mar did not give it the <i>isnad</i> until later.</p>

<p><b>XII. Dreams during the day</b></p>

<p> 'Awn said that Ibn Sirin said, "The dream in the day is like the dream at night."</p>

<p>6600. Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha related that he heard Anas ibn Malik  say, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to visit Umm Haram bint Milhan and she would feed him. Umm Haram was married to 'Ubada ibn as-Samit. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace visited her one day and she fed him and began to delouse his head. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to sleep and then woke up smiling. She said, 'I asked, "What made you smile, Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Some people from my community who were shown me raiding in the way of Allah, riding the middle of this sea like kings on throne" (or like the kings on the thrones ­ Ishaq was unsure)."' She said, 'I said, "Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!"' So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made supplication for her. 'Then he put his head down and then woke up smiling. I said, "What made you smile, Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Some people from my community who were shown me raiding in the way of Allah," as he said the first time.' She said, 'I said, "Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!" He said, "You are among the first.'" She embarked on the sea in the time of Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan and was thrown from her animal when she disembarked from the sea and she was killed."</p>

<p><b>XIII. Women's dreams</b></p>

<p>6601. Ibn Shihab related from Kharija ibn Zayd ibn Thabit that Umm al-'Ala', a woman of the Ansar who had given allegiance to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told him that they drew lots to distribute the [lodging of the] Muhajirun. She said, "'Uthman ibn Maz'un fell to our lot and we lodged him in our rooms. Then he fell ill with an illness from which he died. When he died, he was washed and shrouded in his clothes. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came and I said, 'The mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu's-Sa'ib. I testify to you that Allah has honoured you.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'How do you know that Allah has honoured him?' I said, 'May my father be your ransom, Messenger of Allah, who will Allah honour?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'As for him, by Allah, the Certain has come to him. By Allah, I hope for the best for him. By Allah, I do not know what He will do with me in spite of my being the Messenger of Allah.'" She said, "By Allah, I will never vouch for anyone after him."</p>

<p>6602. Shu'ayb reported this from az-Zuhri. He said, "I do not know what He will do me." She said, "That made me sad and then I went to sleep and dreamt that 'Uthman had a spring which was flowing. I informed the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, "That represents his deeds."</p>

<p><b>XIV. The bad dream is from Shaytan. When someone has a bad dream, he should spit to his left and seek refuge from Allah, the Mighty and Exalted</b></p>

<p>6603. Abu Salama related that Abu Qatada al-Ansari, one of the Companions and horsemen of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'A vision is from Allah and a bad dream is from Shaytan. When one of you has a dream which he dislikes, he should spit to his left and seek refuge with Allah from it. It will not harm him.'"</p>

"As the <i>deen</i>," he answered.</p>

They should not say that about which they have no knowledge! I had a dream in which a pillar was placed and set up in a green meadow. There was a handle at the stop of it and at the bottom of it was a servant. (<i>Minsaf</i> means a servant). It was said [to me], 'Climb it.' So I climbed it and took hold of the handle. I recounted the dream to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said. ''Abdullah will die while holding to the firmest handle.'"</p>

<p><b>XX. Disclosing a woman in a dream</b></p>

<p>6614. Muhammad ibn Sirin related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'When the time [of the Final Hour] approaches, the dream of the believer will hardly ever lie. The dream of the believer is one forty-sixth part of prophethood.' That which is part of prophethood does not lie." Muhammad stated, "I say this." He said that it used to be said, "There are three types of dreams: the chatter of the self, attempts of Shaytan to frighten the dreamer, and good news from Allah. Whoever sees anything he dislikes should not recount it to anyone. He should get up and pray." He said, "He disliked to see iron collars in a dream but he liked fetters." It is said that the fetter represents constancy in the <i>deen</i>.</p>
<p>	It is related from Ibn Sirin from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Some of them included all of it in the <i>hadith</i>. The <i>hadith</i> of 'Awf is clearer. Yunus said, "I do not reckon that it is from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, except what he said about fetters."</p>
<p>	Abu 'Abdullah said, "<i>Ghull</i> is only used for necks.'</p>

<p><b>XXVII. A flowing spring in a dream</b></p>

<p>6615.  Kharija ibn Zayd ibn Thabit related from Umm al-'Ala', one of their women who gave allegiance to the Prophet, say, "'Uthman ibn Maz'un fell to our lot in giving lodging when the Ansar drew lots for the lodging of the Muhajirun. He became ill and we cared for him until he died. Then he put him in his clothes and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to us. I said, 'The mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu's-Sa'ib. I testify to you that Allah has honoured you.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'How do you know that?' I said, 'I do not know, by Allah.' He said, ' As for him, the Certain has come to him. I hope for the best for him from Allah. By Allah, in spite of my being the Messenger of Allah, do not know what my Lord will do with me or you.'' Umm al-'Ala' said, " By Allah, I will never vouch for anyone after him."

<p>	6616. Nafi' related that from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, " I dreamt that I was at a well drawing water when Abu Bakr and 'Umar came. Abu Bakr took the bucket and drew one or two buckets. There was some weakness in his drawing. Then the son of Ibn al-Khattab took it from Abu Bakr's hand and it turned into a large bucket in his hand. I have not seen a leader among the people work so well as he did until the people watered their camels."</p>

<p><b>XXIX. Drawing one or buckets of water with some weakness</b></p>

<p>6618. Sa'id related that Abu Hurayra reported to him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "While I was asleep, I dreamt that I was at a well which had a bucket.

<p><b>XVIII. Interpreting dreams after the Subh prayer</b></p>

<p>6640. Abu Raja' related that Samura ibn Jundub said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to frequently say, 'Has any of you had a dream?' Then whoever Allah wished would recount their dream. He said that one morning, 'During the night two men came to me and said to me, "Come on!" So I went with them. We came to a man who was lying on his back while another man was standing over him with a stone which he then dropped onto his head, crushing it. Then the stone rolled away from him and he went after the stone to retrieve it. When he returned to him, his head was whole again and had become as it had been in the first place. So he went back and hit him as he had done the first time. I said to them, "Glory be to Allah! Who are these two?" They said, "Go on! Go on!" We went on and came to a man who was lying on his back, and there was another man standing over him with an iron hook. He went to one side of his face and cut open the side of his mouth until it reached the back of his neck and then his nostril to the back of his neck and his eye to the back of his neck. Then he moved to the other side and did the same thing as he had done to first side. When he finished that side, the first side had become whole again. Then he did the same thing all over again I said, "Glory be to Allah! Who are these two?" They said to me, "Go on! Go on!" and we went on until we came upon something like an oven. [I think he said, "There was babble and shouting in it.'] We looked down into it and it contained naked men and women. The flames would come at them from underneath, and when those flames reached them, they cried out. I asked, "Who are they?" They said, "Go on! Go on!" and we went on until we came to a river.'" [I think that he said, "'Red like blood."] In the river there was a man swimming while on the bank of the river there was a man who had many stones with him. When that swimmer swam and reached the one who had gathered the stones, he forced his mouth open and made him swallow a stone. Then he would begin to swim and would come back to him again. Whenever he came back to him, he forced open his mouth and made him swallow a stone. I asked them, "Who are these two?" They said to me, "Go on! Go on!" and we went on until we came to a man with a repulsive appearance - or the most repulsive man you have ever seen. He was at a fire which he was kindling and which he was running around. I said to them, "Who is this?' They said to me, "Go on! Go on!" and we went on until we came to a green meadow containing every type of spring flower. In the middle of the meadow there was a man so tall that I could scarcely see his head, so high it was in the sky. Around the man were the greatest number of children I have ever seen. I asked, "Who is this? Who are those?" They told me, "Go on! Go on!" and we went on until we reached a huge tree, and I have never seen any tree bigger or more beautiful than it. They told me, "Climb it." We climbed it and came to a city built of gold and silver bricks. We came to the door of the city and asked for it to be opened and it was opened for us and we entered it. We were met by men half of whose physique was the most beautiful you have ever seen and the other half was the ugliest you have ever seen. The two said to them, "Go and plunge into that river." There was a wide river flowing there whose water was pure white. They went and jumped into it and when they returned to us, that evil had left them and they had the most beautiful form.'</p>
<p>	"He said, 'They said to me, "This is the Garden of Eden, and that is your place." I raised my eyes upwards and there was a castle like a white cloud. They said to me, "This is your place." I said to them, "May Allah bless you, let me enter it." They said, "No, not now. But you will enter it." I said to them, "This night I have seen marvels, but what are these things which I have seen?'" They said to me, "We will tell you. The first man to whom you came whose head was being crushed with the stone is a man who memorised the Qur'an and then abandoned it and slept through the obligatory prayers. As for the man you came to whose jaw was split to his neck, whose nostril to his neck and whose eye to his neck, he was a man who went from his house and told lies which spread everywhere. As for the naked men and women who were in something like an oven, they were adulterers and adulteresses. The man you came to who was swimming in the river and being made to swallow stones used to consume usury. The man with the disagreeable appearance who was at the fire, kindling it and running around it was Malik, the guardian of Jahannam. The tall man in the meadow was Ibrahim. The children who were around him are all those who were born and died in the natural state."'"</p>
<p>	He said, "One of the Muslims asked, 'Messenger of Allah, the children of the idolaters as well?' The Messenger of Allah said, 'The children of the idolaters as well. As for the people who were half beautiful and half ugly, they are the people who mixed righteous actions with evil actions. Allah excused them.'"</p>
