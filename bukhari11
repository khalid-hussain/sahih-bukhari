Actions in the Prayer</A></BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: Making use of the hands in the prayer if it is connected with doing
the prayer</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "A man can make use of any part of his body he wishes to
help in his prayer." Abu Ishaq took off and put on his hat during the prayer,
and 'Ali placed his palm on his left wrist except when scratching his skin
or arranging his clothes."
<P>
1140. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Ibn 'Abbas that he spent the night
in the house of his maternal aunt, Maymuna bint al-Harith, Umm al-Mu'minin.
and He said, "I lay down crossways on the bed, and the Messenger of Allah
and his wife lay down lengthways on it. He slept until halfway through the
night or close to it when he awoke and wiped away the sleep from his face.
Then, after reciting ten verses from Ali 'Imran, the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and went over to a water-skin
which was hanging up and did <I>wudu'</I>, doing it thoroughly. Then he stood
up to pray."
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said, "I did the same, going to stand at his side. He
put his right hand on my head and tweaked my ear. Then he prayed two
<I>rak'ats</I>, then two<I> rak'ats</I>, then two<I> rak'ats</I>, then two
rak'ats, then two<I> rak'ats</I>, then two<I> rak'ats</I>, and then the
<I>witr</I>. Then he lay down until the <I>mu'adhdhin</I> came to him. He
got up and prayed two<I> rak'ats </I>and then went out and prayed
<I>Subh</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Kinds of speech prohibited in the prayer</B>
<P>
1141. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "We used to greet the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he was praying and he would reply
to us. But when we returned from the Negus [in Abyssinia] we greeted him
and he did not reply to us. He said, 'In the prayer is occupation enough.'"
<P>
The like of it related from 'Abdullah from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace.
<P>
1142. It is related that Zayd ibn Arqam said, "We used to talk during the
prayer in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
someone saying what he needed to his companion, until it was revealed<I>,
'Safeguard the prayer', </I>(2:238) and we were commanded to be silent."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Glorification and praise permitted for men during the prayer </B>
<P>
1143. It is related that Sahl said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, went out to make peace between the members of Banu 'Amr
ibn 'Awf and the time of the prayer came. Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said,
'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has been held up,
so you should lead the people.' He said, 'Yes, if you wish.' Bilal called
the <I>iqama</I> for the prayer and Abu Bakr came forward and started the
prayer. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came walking
through the rows until he was standing in the first row and the people began
to clap (<I>tasfih</I>)." Sahl asked, 'Do you know what <I>tasfih</I> is?
It is the same as <I>tasfiq</I>.' "Abu Bakr was not someone who used to look
round in his prayer but when the clapping increased he looked round and saw
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the row. The Prophet
&nbsp;indicated to him to stay where he was but Abu Bakr raised both his
hands and praised Allah and stepped back and the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went forward and led the prayer."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Someone calling out people's names or greeting someone else during
the prayer out of ignorance</B>
<P>
1144. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "We used to say the greeting
in the prayer and call out people's names and greet one another. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Say: "Greetings
belong to Allah, and prayers and good words. Peace be upon you, O Prophet,
and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the
right-acting slaves of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah and
I testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger." If you do that,
you have greeted every righteous slave in heaven and earth.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Clapping for women.</B>
<P>
1145. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The saying of 'Glory be to Allah' is for men
and clapping is for women."
<P>
1146. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said &nbsp;"The saying of 'Glory be to Allah' is
for men and clapping is for women."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Someone moving backwards or forwards because of something that
happens</B>
<P>
Sahl ibn Sa'd related it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
1147. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "That Monday, as the Muslims were
doing <I>'</I> with Abu Bakr leading the prayer, the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, suddenly lifted the curtain of 'A'isha's room and
looked at them standing in their rows. He smiled broadly. Abu Bakr stepped
back, thinking that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, wanted to come out to join the prayer. The Muslims were tested
in their prayer by their joy at seeing the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace. He indicated with his hand for them to complete it. Then
he went back into the room and let down the curtain. He died that day."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: If a mother calls her son while he is doing the prayer</B>
<P>
1148. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A woman called her son while
he was in a hermitage, saying, 'Jurayj!" He said, 'O Allah, my mother and
my prayer!' She said, 'Jurayj!' He said, 'O Allah, my mother and my prayer!'
She said, 'Jurayj!' He said, 'O Allah, my mother and my prayer!' She said,
O Allah, do not let Jurayj die until he has looked on the face of a prostitute!'
A shepherdess used to come to his hermitage, tending her sheep. She gave
birth to a child and was asked, 'Whose child is this?' She said, 'Jurayj,'
who came out of his hermitage. Jurayj said, 'Where is this woman who claims
that her child is mine?' He said, 'Baby, who is your father?' He said, 'The
shepherd.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Brushing away pebbles in the prayer</B>
<P>
1149. It is related from Mu'ayqib that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said about a man smoothing out the earth where he does
<I>sajda</I>, "If you do it, then do it once."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Spreading the clothes out in the prayer to do sajda on</B>
<P>
1150. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "Sometimes we used to pray
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in times of intense
heat. If it was not possible for someone to place his face on the earth,
he would spread out his garment and do <I>sajda</I> on that."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Actions which are permitted during the prayer</B>
<P>
1151. It was related that 'A'isha said, "I used to stretch out my legs in
the <I>qibla</I> of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
while he was praying. When he went into <I>sajda</I>, he would touch me and
I would remove them. When he stood up, I stretched them out again."
<P>
1152. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, once did a prayer and said, "Shaytan presented himself
to me and tried hard to get me to break off my prayer. Allah gave me power
over him and I managed to choke him. I considered tying him to a pillar so
that you would be able to see him in the morning, but I remembered the words
of Sulayman, peace be upon him, 'My Lord, give me a kingdom which no one
after me will have.' Allah made him return humiliated."
<P>
An-Nadr ibn Shumayl said, <I>"dha'attuhu" </I>means choked and
<I>"da''attuhu"</I> is from the words of Allah, <I>"The day when they are
called,"</I> (52:13) i.e. driven. What is correct is "<I>da'attuhu</I>".
However, he said it like that with the double<I> 'ayn </I>and<I> ta'</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: If an animal runs off while someone is doing the prayer</B>
<P>
Qarada said, "If someone's garment is stolen, he should leave the prayer
and puruse the thief."
<P>
1153. It is related from al-Azraq ibn Qays, "We were at al-Ahwaz fighting
the al-Haruriyya. While I was on the bank of a river, I saw a man praying
holding the reins of his animal in his hand. The animal began to struggle
and he began to follow it. (Shu'ba said that the man was Abu Barza al-Aslami.)
A man from the Kharijites began to say, 'O Allah! Inflict something on this
old man!' When the man finished the prayer, he said, 'I heard what you said.
I went on six, seven or eight expeditions with the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I saw how he made things easy. I
would rather return together with my animal than let it go back to its stable
alone which would make things very difficult for me.'"
<P>
[The Haruriyya are the Kharijites]
<P>
1154. It is related that 'A'isha said, "There was an eclipse of the sun and
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood and recited a
long <I>sura</I> and then he went into <I>ruku' </I>and made the<I> ruku'
</I>long. Then he raised his head and then began another <I>sura</I>. Then
he went into<I> ruku'</I> until he finished tha<I>t ruku</I>' and then did
<I>sajda</I>. Then he did the same thing in the second <I>rak'at</I>. Then
he said, 'The sun and moon are two of Allah's signs. When you see this, pray
until it has passed. While I was standing I saw everything that I have been
promised so that when you saw me go forward it was because I saw that I wanted
to take a bunch from the Garden and when you saw me draw back it was because
I saw <I>Jahannam</I> with its parts consuming one another. In it I saw 'Amr
ibn Luhayy who began the practice of <I>sa'iba</I>.[letting animals go free
for the sake of idols]"
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: The kinds of spitting and blowing which are allowed during the
prayer</B>
<P>
It is mentioned from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, blew out in his <I>sajda</I> during the eclipse.
<P>
1155. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw some phlegm on the <I>qibla</I>
wall and became angry with the people of the mosque. He said, "When you are
praying, you should not spit - or he said expectorate." Then he got down
and scraped it off with his hand. Ibn 'Umar said, "When you spit, you should
spit to your left."
<P>
1156. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "When you stand in the prayer, you are in close conversation
with your Lord. You should not spit in front of you, but to your left or
under your left foot."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: If a man claps in his prayer out of ignorance, it does not invalidate
his prayer</B>
<P>
Sahl ibn Sa'd said that from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: If someone praying is asked to go forward or wait and then he waits,
there is no harm in it</B>
<P>
1157. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "Some men used to pray with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with their wrappers
tied around their necks because of their smallness. The women were told,
"Do not to raise your heads until the men are sitting up straight."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Not returning the <I>salam</I> during the prayer</B>
<P>
1158. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "I used to greet the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was praying and he would answer
me. When we returned, I greeted him but he did not answer us. He said, 'In
the prayer is occupation enough.'"
<P>
1159. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent me to do something and I went
and returned having done it. I came up to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and greeted him but he did not return my greeting. I
was upset as Allah knows best and said to myself, 'Perhaps the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is angry with me because
I was slow in coming back. Then I greeted him again and he did not return
my greeting and I felt even more upset than I had the first time. Then I
greeted him again and he returned my greeting and said, 'I was prevented
from replying to you because I was praying.' He was on his mount and he was
not facing <I>qibla</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Raising the hands during the prayer because of something that happens
during it</B>
<P>
1160. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, heard that there was some disagreement
among the Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf at Quba'. He went out with some of his Companions
to make peace between them. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was delayed and it became time for the prayer. Bilal went
to Abu Bakr and said, 'Abu Bakr, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, is delayed and it is time for the prayer. Can you
lead the people?' He said, 'Yes, if you wish.' Bilal called the <I>iqama</I>
for the prayer and Abu Bakr went forward and said the takbir for the people.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came walking
through the rows until he was standing in the first row and the people started
to clap (<I>tasfih</I>)." (Sahl said that <I>tasfih</I> is the same as tasfiq.)
He said, "Abu Bakr was not someone who used to look around in the prayer
but when the people increased their clapping, he did turn around and there
was the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He indicated
to him to carry on praying but Abu Bakr raised his hands and praised Allah
and then stepped backwards so that he was standing in the row. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went forward and led the
prayer. When he finished, he turned to the people and said, 'Why, when something
happened to you in the prayer, did you begin to clap? Clapping is for women.
If something happens to you in the prayer, you should say, "Glory be to Allah!"'
Then he turned to Abu Bakr and said, 'Abu Bakr, what stopped you from leading
the people in prayer when I indicated to you to do it?' Abu Bakr said, 'It
is not for Ibn Abi Quhafa to pray in front of the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Placing the hands on the hips during the prayer</B>
<P>
1161. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Placing the hands on the hips
during the prayer was forbidden."
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet.
<P>
1162. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "It was forbidden for a man to
pray with his hands resting on his hips."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: A man reflecting on something during the prayer</B>
<P>
'Umar said, "I [mentally] organise my army while I am doing the prayer."
<P>
1163. It is related that 'Uqba ibn al-Harith said, "I prayed <I>'Asr </I>with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When he said the
<I>taslim</I>, he stood up quickly and went to one of his wives and then
came out. He saw the people's astonishment at his speed in their faces. He
said. 'While I was praying, I remembered a piece of gold in my house and
I did not want it to spend the evening - or the night - in our possession,
so I commanded that it be distributed.'"
<P>
1164. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the <I>adhan</I> for the prayer
is called Shaytan retreats, passing wind, so that he will not hear it. When
the <I>mu'adhdhin</I> is silent he comes back again, until, when the
<I>iqama</I> is said, he once more retreats. When the <I>mu'adhdhin</I> is
silent again, he comes back and keeps saying to a man, 'Remember such and
such,' something he was not thinking about before, until the man does not
know how much he has prayed."
<P>
Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, "If you do that, you should do
<I>sajdas</I> while you are sitting." Abu Salama heard it from Abu Hurayra.
<P>
1165. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "People say, 'Abu Hurayra relates
too much.' I met a man and asked him what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had recited the day before during the<I> 'Isha'
</I>prayer. He said, 'I do not know.' I said, 'Weren't you there?' He said,
'Yes.' I said, 'But I know. He recited such-and-such a <I>sura</I>.'"

<P>
<P>
<B>I: What has come down regarding forgetfulness in the prayer. What happens
if someone gets straight up after two <I>rak'ats</I> of the obligatory
prayer</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#70">1166</A>. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Buhayna
said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led
us in prayer for two<I> rak'ats </I>of one of the prayers and then got up
without sitting back. Everyone got up with him. When he finished the prayer
and we were waiting for the <I>taslim</I>, he said a <I>takbir</I> before
the <I>taslim</I> and performed two prostrations from the sitting position
and then said the <I>taslim</I>."
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#71">1167</A>. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Buhayna
said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood
up after two <I>rak'ats </I>of <I>Dhuhr</I> without sitting back. When he
finished his prayer, he performed two prostrations and then said the
<I>taslim</I> after that."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: If someone prays five rak'ats</B>
<P>
1168. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> with five rak'ats and
was asked, "Has the prayer been lengthened?" He said, "Why do you ask that?"
He was told, "You prayed five." So he performed two prostrations after the
<I>taslim</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>III: When you say the <I>taslim</I> after two <I>rak'ats</I> or three,
you should perform two prostrations the same as the prostrations in the prayer
or longer</B>
<P>
1169. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, led us in the <I>Dhuhr</I> or <I>'Asr </I>prayer
and said the <I>taslim</I>. Dhu'l-Yadayn said, 'Messenger of Allah, has the
prayer been shortened?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said to his Companions, 'Is what he says true?' They said, 'Yes.' So he prayed
another two <I>rak'ats</I> and then performed two prostrations."
<P>
Sa'd said, "I saw 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr pray two<I> rak'ats</I> for
<I>Maghrib</I> and then say the <I>taslim</I>. He spoke and then prayed the
rest and performed two prostrations. He said, 'This is what the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Someone not saying the tashahhud in the two prostrations of forgetfulness
and saying the <I>taslim</I>.</B>
<P>
Anas and al-Hasan did not say the <I>tashahhud</I>. Qatada said that the
<I>tashahhud</I> should not be said.
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#62">1170</A>. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished after
two <I>rak'ats</I> and Dhu'l-Yadayn asked, 'Has the prayer been shortened
or did you forget, Messenger of Allah?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Has Dhu'l-Yadyan spoken the truth?'
The people said, 'Yes.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, stood up and prayed another two <I>rak'ats </I>and then said the
<I>taslim</I>. Then he said the <I>takbir</I> and prostrated like his normal
prostration or a little longer and then came up."
<P>
1171. It is related that Salama ibn 'Alqama said, "I spoke to Muhammad about
saying the <I>tashahhud</I> in my prostrations of forgetfulness and he said,
'It is not in the <I>hadith</I> of Abu Hurayra."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Someone saying the <I>takbir</I> in the two prostrations of
forgetfulness.</B>
<P>
1172. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, prayed either<I> 'Asr </I>or <I>'Isha'</I>. (Muhammad
said, "I think that it was probably <I>'Asr</I>) doing two<I> rak'ats</I>.
Then he said the <I>taslim</I> and stood next to a piece of wood in the front
of the mosque and put his hand on it. Abu Bakr and 'Umar were among those
who were there and they were too awed to say anything to him and people left
quickly. They were saying, 'Has the prayer been shortened?' A man whom the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called Dhu'l-Yadayn said,
'Did you forget or has the prayer been shortened?' He said, 'I did not forget
nor has it been shortened.' He said, 'Yes, you did forget.' So he prayed
two <I>rak'ats</I> and then said the <I>taslim</I>. Then he said the
<I>takbir</I> and prostrated like his normal prostration or longer. Then
he raised his head, saying the <I>takbir</I>. Then he lowered his head saying
the <I>takbir</I> and prostrated like his normal prostration or longer. Then
he raised his head and said the <I>takbir</I>."
<P>
1173. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Buhayna al-Asdi, the ally of the Banu
'Abdu'l-Muttalib that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, stood up in the <I>Dhuhr</I> prayer when he should have sat back.
When he finished his prayer, he did two prostrations and said the
<I>takbir</I> in each prostration in the sitting position before he said
the <I>taslim</I>. The people prostrated with him to compensate for the sitting
which he had forgotten.
<P>
Ibn Jurayj corroborated it from Ibn Shihab in the <I>takbir</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: If someone does not know whether he has prayed three or four
<I>rak'ats</I>, he does two prostrations from the sitting position.</B>
<P>
<B> </B>1174. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the call to prayer is
made Shaytan retreats, passing wind, so that he will not hear the
<I>adhan</I>. When the <I>adhan</I> is finished he comes back. When the
<I>iqama</I> is said, he retreats again. When it is finished, he comes back
and gets between a man and his own self and says, 'Remember such-and-such
and such-and-such,' things he was not thinking about before, until the man
does not know how much he has prayed. When one of you does not know whether
he has prayed three or four, he should do two prostrations from the sitting
position."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Forgetfulness in the obligatory and supererogatory prayers</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas performed two prostrations after the <I>Witr</I>.
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#s1">1175</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;said,
"When one of you stands in prayer, Shaytan comes to him and confuses him
until he does not know how much he has prayed. When one of you experiences
that, he should do two prostrations from the sitting position."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Someone being spoken to while he is praying and making a gesture
with his hand and listening</B>
<P>
1176. It is related from Kurayb that Ibn 'Abbas, al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and
'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Azhar sent him to 'A'isha saying, "Greet her from all
of us and ask her about the two <I>rak'ats</I> after the<I> 'Asr </I>prayer
and say to her, 'We were told that you pray them although it has come down
to us that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade
them.'" Ibn 'Abbas said, "I and 'Umar ibn al-Khattab used to beat people
for doing them."
<P>
Kurayb said, "I went to 'A'isha and conveyed my message to her. She said,
'Ask Umm Salama.' So I went out to them and told them what she had said and
they sent me to Umm Salama with the same message they had sent me to 'A'isha
with. Umm Salama said, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, forbid them and then I saw him praying them after he had prayed<I>
'Asr</I>. Then he came in when I had with me some of the women from the Banu
Haram of the Ansar. I sent a slavegirl to him and said, "Stand beside him
and say to him, 'Umm Salama says to you, "Messenger of Allah, I heard you
forbid these two<I> rak'ats </I>but now I see you praying them."' If he makes
a gesture with his hand, then wait for him." The slavegirl did that and he
made a gesture with his hand and she waited for him. When he finished, he
said, "Daughter of Abi Umayya, you have asked me about the two <I>rak'ats</I>
after <I>'Asr.</I> Some people from the 'Abdu'l-Qays came to me and kept
me too busy to pray the two <I>rak'ats a</I>fter <I>Dhuhr</I> and that is
what these are."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Making a gesture in the prayer</B>
<P>
Kurayb reported that from Umm Salama from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace.
<P>
1177. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi said, "The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, heard that there was a dispute
among the Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf and went out to make peace between them. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was delayed
and the time of the prayer was near. Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, 'Abu
Bakr, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has
been detained and the time of the prayer is near, so can you lead the people.'
He said, 'Yes, if you wish.' Bilal called the <I>iqama</I> and Abu Bakr came
forward and said the <I>takbir</I> for the people. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came walking through the rows until he was
standing in the first row and the people began to clap. Abu Bakr did not
normally turn round in his prayer. When the people increased their clapping,
he looked round and saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, there. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, indicated to him to continue praying. Abu Bakr raised both his hands
and praised Allah and stepped backwards until he was standing in the row
and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went
forward and led the people in prayer. When he finished the prayer, he faced
the people and said, 'O people, why, when something happened to you in the
prayer, did you begin to clap? Clapping is for women. When something happens
to you in the prayer, you should say, "Glory be to Allah!
(<I>Subhanallah</I>)." There is no one who will not turn round when they
hear the words "Glory be to Allah". Abu Bakr, what kept you from continuing
to lead the people in prayer when I indicated to you to do it?' Abu Bakr
said, 'It is not proper that Ibn Abi Quhafa should pray in front of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>
1178. It is related that Asma' said, "I went to 'A'isha while she was standing
in prayer and the people were also standing. I asked, 'What are the people
doing?' She indicated with her head to the sky and I said, 'A sign?' She
indicated yes with her head."
<P>
1179. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "The Messenger
of Allah*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed sitting down in
his house when he was ill. The people prayed behind him standing and he indicated
to them to sit down. When he finished, he said, 'The Imam was appointed to
be followed. Bow when he bows and raise your head when he raises his."

for you."

mosque and did not speak to anyone before coming to 'A'isha. He went to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who was covered with a
striped cloak and uncovered his face. He bent over him and kissed him and
then wept, saying, 'May my father and mother be your ransom, O Prophet of
Allah! Allah will not make you die two deaths. You have died the death which
was written for you."

to the people. He said, 'Sit down,' but 'Umar refused to. He said, 'Sit down,'
but he refused again. Then Abu Bakr said the <I>shahada</I> and the people
veered towards him and away from 'Umar. He said, 'As for what follows: Any
among you who worship Muhammad, should know that Muhammad has died. Any who
worship Allah, should know that Allah is alive and can never die. Allah says,
<I>"Muhammad is only a Messenger </I>... (to)...<I> Allah will recompense
the thankful</I>." (3:144)' By Allah, It was as if no one had known that
Allah had revealed this until Abu Bakr recited it. People took it from him
and there was no one who was not heard reciting it."
<P>
1186. It is related from Kharija ibn Zayd ibn Thabit, "Umm al-'Ala', a woman
of the Ansar who gave her allegiance to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, told me, 'The Muhajirun were shared out by drawing lots
and we got 'Uthman ibn Maz'un. We lodged him in our rooms. Then he became
ill with a fatal ilness. When he died and was washed and shrouded in his
clothes, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
came. I said, "The mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu's-Sa'ib. I testify to
you that Allah has honoured you." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "How do you know that Allah has honoured him?" I said, "May
my father be your ransom, Messenger of Allah! Who then will Allah honour?"
He said, "The Certain has come to him. By Allah, I hope for the best for
him. By Allah, I do not know what He will do with me in spite of my being
the Messenger of Allah." She said, "By Allah, I never vouched for anyone
after that."'"

<P>
1187. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "When my father was killed,
I began to lift the cloth from his face weeping and they forbade me The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not forbid me. My aunt Fatima

"It does not matter whether you weep or do not weep. The angels were shading
him with their wings until you removed it.'"

a cloak. Hamza or another man was killed and he was a better man than me

Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the sake of Allah and our reward
was in the hands of Allah. Some of us died without tasting any of our reward,
and one of them was Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr, and some of us had its fruit ripen
and plucked it. He was killed on the day of Uhud and we did not find anything
to shroud him with except for a cloak. When we covered his head with it,
his feet stuck out, and when we covered his feet, his head stuck out. So
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded us to cover
his head and put <I>idhkhir</I>-herb on his feet."

She said, 'I wove it with my own hands and I brought it so that you could
wear it.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took it as
he was in need of it. He came out to us using it as a waist-wrapper. Someone
admired it and said, 'Clothe me in it. How beautiful it is!' Some people
said, 'You have not acted rightly. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, wore it and needed it and then you asked him for it knowing that
he never refuses.' He said, 'By Allah, I have not asked for it in order to
wear it, but I have asked for it only so that it can be my shroud.'" Sahl

death of Abu Sufyan arrived from Syria, Umm Habiba called for yellow scent
on the third day and wiped it on her cheeks and arms and said, 'I would not
need to do this if I had not heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, say, 'It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the
Last Day to mourn for a dead person more than three days unless it is her
husband. She should mourn him for four months and ten days.'"

Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "It is not lawful for a woman who
believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for a dead person more than three
days unless it is her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and
ten days."' Then I visited Zaynab bint Jahsh when her brother died. She asked
for scent and put it on and then said, 'I only put on perfume because I heard
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say on the
minbar, "It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last
Day to mourn for a dead person more than three days unless it is her husband
for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days."'"

said, 'Fear Allah and show fortitude.' She said, not recognising him, 'Leave
me alone. You have not been struck by such an affliction as mine!' She was
told, 'It is the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' She went
to the door of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and,
finding no one guarding the door, she said, 'I did not recognise you.' He
said, 'The time for fortitude is at the first shock.'"

be borne for him." </I>(35:18)

with Him, so she should show fortitude and expect a reward.' She sent to

by one of them and then the other came and sat beside me.") 'Abdullah ibn
'Umar said to 'Amr ibn 'Uthman, 'Why do you not forbid them to weep? The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A dead
person is punished by his relatives weeping over him."' Ibn 'Abbas said,
''Umar used to say that.' Then he related, 'I went out with 'Umar from Makka
until we were at al-Bayda'. There were some riders under an acacia tree.
He said, "Go and see who these riders are."'" He said, "I looked and there
was Suhayb. I told him this and he said, 'Call him to me.' I returned to
Suhayb and said, 'Come and join the Amir al-Mu'minin.' When 'Umar was struck
down, Suhayb entered weeping, saying, 'O brother! O friend!' 'Umar said,
'Suhayb, are you weeping for me when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "A dead person is punished by some of his
relatives' weeping over him"?' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'When 'Umar died, I mentioned
that to 'A'isha and she said, "May Allah have mercy on 'Umar. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not say, 'Allah punishes
a believer on account of the weeping of his relatives over him,' but the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah
increases the punishment of the unbeliever on account of his relatives' weeping
over him.'" She said, 'The Qur'an is enough for you: <I>"No bearer of any
burden can bear that of any other." </I>(6:164)' Ibn 'Abbas then said, 'Allah
makes people laugh and weep.'"

him and my people forbade me. The Messenger of Allah commanded that he be
removed and he heard the voice of a crying woman. He said, 'Who is this?'

me and I have property and no heirs except a daughter. Shall I give two-thirds
of my property away as <I>sadaqa</I>?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'A half?' He
said, 'No.' He said, 'A third, and a third is great (or a lot) It is better
to leave rich heirs than to leave them poor, begging from other people. There
is nothing you spend, desiring by it the face of Allah, but that you will
be rewarded, even for a morsel you put in your wife's mouth.' I said, 'Messenger
of Allah, will I be left behind after my companions leave?' He said, 'You
will not be left behind, for any virtuous actions you do will raise you in
degree and elevation. And then you might be left behind so that some people
will benefit from you and others harmed by you. O Allah, let My Companions'
complete their emigration and do not let them turn back on their heels,'
but poor Sa'd ibn Khawla had the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, grieve over his death in Makka."

to him a second time saying that they had not obeyed him. He said, 'Forbid
them.' He returned a third time and said, 'Messenger of Allah, they are too
much for us.'" She claimed that he said, "Put dust in their mouths." She

truth." He continued, "He passed the night and in the morning did
<I>ghusl</I> and then, when he was about to go out, she told him that he
had died. He did the prayer with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and then told the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
what had happened to them. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'Perhaps Allah will bless the night for both of you.'"

died?' They said, 'No, Messenger of Allah.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, wept. When the people saw the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, weeping, they wept. He said, 'Listen, Allah
does not punish for the tears of the eyes nor for the sorrow of the heart,
but he punishes or shows mercy on account of this,' and he pointed to his

join them by doing a <I>takbir</I>.

'Abbas.'"
<P>
1272. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "A black man or woman used to sweep
the mosque and then died. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him

Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' He will say, 'I testify
that he is the slave of Allah and His Messenger.' It will be said, 'Look
at your place in the Fire. Allah has given you, in exchange for it, a place
in the Garden.'" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"He will see both places. The unbeliever or the hypocrite will say, 'I do
not know. I used to say what everyone else said.' He will be told, 'You neither
understood nor followed the guidance.' Then he will be hit between the ears
with an iron hammer and will cry out with a cry which is heard by everything
near him except men and jinn."

to his Lord and said, 'You sent me to a slave who does not want to die.'
Allah restored his eye and said, "Go back and tell him to put his hand on
the back of an ox and he will live a year for every hair that his hand covers."
Musa said, 'O Lord, then what?' He said, 'Then death.' He said, 'Let it be

his head and said, 'Among those people, when a virtuous man among them dies,
they build a place of prayer over his grave and then they make those pictures
in it. Those are the worst of creatures in the sight of Allah.'"

of) one of the daughters of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace." He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was sitting by the grave." He said, "I saw tears flowing
from his eyes. He said, 'Is there any man among you who did not have sexual
intercourse last night?' Abu Talha said, 'Me.' He said, 'Get down into her

of Uhud, and he did not wash them."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIV: Who should be put first in the grave niche (<I>lahd</I>).</B>
<P>
It is called a niche (<I>lahd</I>) because it is in one side. Every deviant

dug straight down, it is called <I>darih</I>.
<P>

<P>
Another <I>isnad</I> from Jabir.
<P>

<P>
1284. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "Allah made Makka a sanctuary. It was
not lawful for anyone before me to violate it and will not be lawful for
anyone after me. It was only made lawful for me for one hour of one day.
Its thorn bushes may not be uprooted nor its trees cut down nor its game
hunted nor any dropped things picked up in it except by someone who announces
that he has done so". Al-'Abbas said, "Except for the <I>idhkhir</I> herb
for our goldsmiths and our graves!" The Prophet said, "Except for the
<I>idhkhir</I> herb."
<P>
Abu Hurayra said from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy after
he had been put into his grave and ordered that he be taken out. His body
was placed on his knees and he (the Prophet) put some of his saliva on him
and clothed him in his shirt. Allah knows best that he had given 'Abbas a
shirt to wear."
<P>
Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was wearing two shirts and Ibn 'Abdullah said to him, 'Messenger
of Allah, clothe my father in your shirt which is next to your skin.'" Sufyan

peace, had clothed 'Abdullah in his shirt to recompense him for what he had
done."
<P>

me in the night and said, 'I think that I will be among the first of the
Companions of the Prophet to be slain. I do not leave after me anyone dearer
to me than you except for the soul of the Messenger of Allah*. I have debts,
so repay them and treat your sisters well.' In the morning, he was the first
to be killed and was buried together with someone else in a grave. I was
not happy to leave him with the other person, so six months later I took
him out and he was as he had been on the day I put him in, except for a small
place on his ear."
<P>
1287. It is related that Jabir said, "A man was buried with my father and

a witness for these on the Day of Rising.' He instructed that they be buried
covered in their blood and not washed."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVIII: When a child becomes Muslim and then dies, is the prayer said
over him? Should a child be offered Islam? </B>
<P>
Al-Hasan, Shurayh, Ibrahim and Qatada said, "When one of the parents becomes
Muslim, the child is automatically with the Muslims." Ibn 'Abbas stayed with
his mother among the oppressed and was not with his father who kept to his
people's religion. He said, "Islam is superior and nothing is superior to
it."
<P>
1289. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "'Umar went with the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a group to visit Ibn Sayyad. They
found him playing with some children in the hills of Banu Maghala. Ibn Sayyad,
who was approaching puberty, did not notice them until the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, patted him with his hand and then said to
Ibn Sayyad, 'Do you testify that I am the Messenger of Allah?' Ibn Sayyad
looked at him and said, 'I testify that you are the Messenger of the unlettered.'
Ibn Sayyad said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
'Do you testify that I am the Messenger of Allah?' He refuted it and said,
'I have believed in Allah and His Messengers.' Then he said to him, What
do you think?' Ibn Sayyad said, 'Both truthful people and liars come to me.'
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'You are in a
state of confusion.' Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said to him, 'I am concealing something from you.' Ibn Sayyad said,
'It is just smoke.' He said, 'Shame on you! Do not go too far.' 'Umar said,
'Messenger of Allah, let me cut his head off?' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'If it is him, you will not be able to get
the better of him. If it is not him, there is no point in killing him.'"
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "After that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and Ubayy ibn Ka'b went to the palm-grove where Ibn Sayyad
was staying. He wanted to hear something from Ibn Sayyad without Ibn Sayyad
seeing him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw him
lying down, covered by a sheet from which was coming a murmuring sound. The
mother of Ibn Sayyad saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, concealing himself among the palm trunks and she said to
Ibn Sayyad, 'Saf! (which was a name of Ibn Sayyad) Muhammad, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, is here.' So Ibn Sayyad got up. The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If she had left him, it would
have been clear.'"
<P>
Shu'ayb said in his <I>hadith</I>,<I> "fa-rafasahu"</I> and <I>ramrama</I>
or <I>zamzama</I>. 'Uqayl said <I>ramrama</I> and Ma'mar said <I>ramza</I>.
<P>
1290. It is related that Anas said, "A Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then became ill. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to visit him and sat at his
head and said to him, 'Become Muslim.' He looked at his father who was with
him. He said to him, 'Obey Abu'l-Qasim.' So he became Muslim. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left saying, 'Praise be to Allah
who has saved him from the Fire.'"
<P>
1291. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas used to say, "My mother and I were among
the weak and poor - I was one of the children and my mother was one of the
women."
<P>
1292. It is related that Ibn Shihab said, "You should pray over every dead
child, even if it is the child of a prostitute because he is one in the natural
state of Islam if his parents are Muslims or even if only his father is a
Muslim and his mother not Muslim. Provided that he cries at birth, the prayer
is said over him. It is not said over someone who does not cry at birth as
that is considered a miscarriage. Abu Hurayra related that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'There is no child who is not
born in the natural state and then his parents make him Jewish, Christian
or Magian, just as an animal gives birth to a whole animal. Do you expect
it to be mutilated?' Then Abu Hurayra said,<I> 'The natural form upon which
Allah originated mankind.' </I>(30:30)"
<P>
1293. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said: "There is no child who is not born in
the natural state and then his parents make him Jewish, Christian or Magian,

mutilated?" Then Abu Hurayra said<I>, "The natural form upon which Allah
originated mankind."</I> (30:30)

<P>
1294. It is related from the father of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, "When Abu Talib
was near death, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, came to him and found Abu Jahl ibn Hisham and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya
ibn al-Mughira with him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to Abu Talib, 'Uncle, say, "There is no god but Allah",
and I will testify before Allah that you said it.' Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah
ibn Abi Umayya said, 'Abu Talib! Will you turn from the religion of
'Abdu'l-Muttalib?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, continued to offer it to him and they kept on cautioning him against
it until the last thing that Abu Talib said was that he was of the religion
of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib and refused to say, 'There is no god but Allah.' The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'By Allah,
I will continue to ask for forgiveness for you as long as I am not forbidden
to do it for you.' Then Allah Almighty sent down about him, <I>'It is not
for the Prophet...</I>' (9:113)"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXX: Placing a stripped palm branch on the grave</B>
<P>
Burayda al-Aslami commanded two branches to be placed on his grave. Ibn 'Umar
saw a tent over the grave of 'Abdu'r-Rahman and said, "Remove it, boy! His
deeds shade him him." Kharija ibn Zayd said, "When we young in the time of
'Uthman , I remember that the best jumper among us was the one who could
jump over the grave of 'Uthman ibn Maz'un and clear it." 'Uthman ibn Hakim
said, "Kharija took my hand and made me sit on a grave and he told me that
his uncle, Yazid ibn Thabit said, "That is disliked if you intend to break
<I>wudu' </I>(lit. do <I>hadath</I>) on it." Nafi' said. "Ibn 'Umar used
to sit on graves."
<P>
1295. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, "He passed by two graves whose inhabitants were being
punished.' He said, 'They are not being punished for anything very great.
One of them did not protect himself from urine and the other used to go around
slandering people.' Then he took a green palm branch, split it in two and
then stuck one piece in each grave. They said, 'Messenger of Allah, why did
you do that?' He said, 'For the reason that it may be lightened for them
for as long as they do not not dry out.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXI: Someone giving admonition at the grave and his companions sitting
around him</B>
<P>
<I>"Coming out of the graves"</I> (70:43) where <I>ajdath</I> means graves.<I>
Bu'thirat </I>(82:4) means to raise<I>. "Bu'thara haydi" </I>means to turn
it over. <I>Ifad</I> is to hasten. Al-A'mash recited it as<I> "ila nasb"</I>,
(70:43), menaing "to something set up which they preserve". <I>Nusb</I> is
singular and <I>nasb</I> is a verbal noun. In<I> "on the day of emerging
from the graves," </I>(36:51) <I>yansilun</I> means t"o come out".
<P>
1296. It is related that 'Ali said, "We took part in a funeral prayer in
Baqi' al-Gharqad. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came
to us and sat and we sat around him. He was holding a stick and he lowered
his head and began to strike the ground with his stick. Then he said, 'There
is none of you, nor any created soul, who does not have his place written
for him in the Garden or the Fire. It is written whether or not he is to
be wretched or happy.' A man said, 'Messenger of Allah, should we then rely
on what is written for us and abandon action. Anyone among us who is among
the people of happiness will get the actions of the people of happiness,
and anyone among us who is among the people of wretchedness will get the
actions of the people of wretchedness.' He said, 'The actions leading to
happiness are made easy for the people of happiness and the actions leading
to wretchedness are made easy for the people of wretchedness.' Then he
recited,<I> 'As for he who gives and is godfearing...'</I>" (92:5-6)
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXII: What is said about someone who kills himself</B>
<P>
1297. It is related from Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who deliberately swears falsely
by a religion other than Islam is as he affirms. Whoever kills himself with
a piece of iron will be punished by it in the Fire of Jahannam."
<P>
1298. It is related from Jundub (in this mosque and we did not forget nor
fear that Jundub would lie) that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant

for him.'"

<P>
1300. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "When 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy
ibn Salul died, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, was asked to pray over him. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, stood, I got up quickly to him and said,
'Messenger of Allah, are you going to pray over Ibn Ubayy when he said
such-and-such and such-and-such' and he recounted what he had said. The Messenger
of Allah smiled and said, ''Umar, get away from me.' When I kept at him too
much, he said, 'I have been given a choice and I have chosen. If I knew that
he would be forgiven if I did it more than seventy times, I would do it.'"
He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prayed over him and then left. Shortly after that, the two <I>ayats</I> of
<I>Bara'a </I>(9) were sent down: <I>'And never pray over any of them when
he is dead</I>...to.<I>.ungodly.' </I>(9:84)" He said, "Later I was amazed
at my boldness towards the Messenger of Allah* on that day when Allah and
His Messenger know best."
<P>

<P>
1301. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "A funeral procession passed
by and they were praising the dead man. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'It is inevitable.' Then another passed and they
were speaking ill of the dead man. He said, 'It is inevitable.' 'Umar ibn
al-Khattab said, 'What is inevitable?' He said, 'You praised this one, and
so the Garden is inevitable for him and you spoke evil of this one, so the
Fire is inevitable&nbsp;for him. You are the witnesses of Allah on the earth.'"
<P>
1302. It is related that Abu'l-Aswad said, "I came to Madina during an epidemic.
I was sitting with 'Umar ibn al-Khattab when a funeral passed by and the
dead man was praised. 'Umar said, 'It is inevitable.' Then another passed
by and they praised the dead. 'Umar said, 'It is inevitable.' Then a third
passed by and they spoke ill of the dead. 'Umar said, 'It is inevitable.'"
Abu'l-Aswad said, "I said, 'What is inevitable, Amir al-Mu'minin?' He said,
'I say as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Any
Muslim to whose goodness four people testify, will be admitted by Allah to
the Garden." We said, "And if three do?" He said, "Three as well." We said,
"And two." He said, "Two also." Then we did not ask him about one.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXV: What has come about the punishment in the grave</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "When the wrongdoers in the throes of death
when the angels are stretching out their hands: 'Disgorge your own selves!
Today you will be repaid with the punishment of humiliation.'</I>" (6:93)
<I>Hun</I> is disgrace and <I>hawn</I> is gentleness. The words of Allah
Almighty,<I> "We will punish them twice over and then they will be returned
to a terrible punishment." </I>(9:101) The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "A
most evil torment engulfed Pharaoh's people &#150; the Fire, to which, morning
and night, they are exposed and, on the Day the Hour takes place: 'Admit
Pharaoh's people to the harshest punishment!'"</I> (40:45-46)

bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the believer is made to sit up
in his grave, [the angels] will come to him and he will testify that there
is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. That is
indicated by Allah's words, <I>'Allah makes those who believe firm with the
Firm Word.</I>' (14:27)"

'Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true?' Someone said to
him, 'Are you talking to the dead?' He said, 'You hear no better than they
do. However, they cannot answer.'"

[This refers to the unbelievers killed in the Battle of Badr.]
<P>
1305. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him

1306. It is related from 'A'isha that a Jewish woman came to her and mentioned
the punishment of the grave saying, "May Allah give you refuge from the
punishment of the grave!" So 'A'isha asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, about the punishment of the grave. He said,
"Yes, the punishment of the grave exists." 'A'isha said, "After that, I never
saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray

do you say about this man, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?'
He will say, 'I testify that he is the slave of Allah and His Messenger.'
It will be said, 'Look at your place in the Fire. Allah has given you, in
exchange for it, a place in the Garden.'"
<P>
Qatada said, "It was mentioned to us that his grave would be made spacious,"
and then he continued the <I>hadith</I> of Anas. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The unbeliever or the hypocrite will say,
'I do not know. I used to say what everyone else said.' He will be told,
'You neither understood nor followed the guidance.' Then he will be hit between
the ears with an iron hammer and will cry out with a cry which is heard by
everything near him except men and jinn."

bless him and grant him peace, had prayed the prayer, he would turn to face
us and say, 'Who among you had a dream in the night?'" He said, "If anyone
had had a dream, he would recount it and the Prophet would say, 'As Allah
wills.' One day he asked us and said, 'Has any of you had a dream?' We said,
'No.' He said, 'But in the night I dreamt that two men came to me and took
me by the hand and brought me to the Holy Land. There was a man sitting and
a man standing with an iron hook. (One of our companions said from Musa that)
he put that hook into the side of his mouth until it reached the back of
his neck and then did the same thing to the other side of his mouth and the
first side had become whole. Then he did the same thing again. I said, "What
is this?" They said, "Go on," and we went on until we came upon a man lying
on his back while another man was standing at his head with a stone or a
rock with which he was crushing it. When he hit him, the stone rolled away
and he went to get it. When he returned to the man his head was whole again
and had become as it had been in the first place. So he went back and hit
him again. I said, "Who is this?" They said, "Go on," and we went on until
we came upon a hole like an oven. Its top was narrow and its bottom wide,
and there was a fire kindled under it. When the flames flared up, the people
were lifted until they were almost out and when it subsided, they returned
into it. It contained naked men and women. I said, "Who is this?" They said,
"Go on," and we went on until we came to a river of blood in the middle of
which there was a man standing together with another man carrying some stones
in front of him. The man in the river came forward and when he tried to get
out, the other man threw a stone into his mouth and he went back to where
he had been before. Whenever he tried to get out, the other would throw a
stone in his mouth and he would go back to where he had been before. I said,
"What is this?" They said, "Go on," and we went on until we came to a green
meadow with a huge tree in it. At its foot was an old man and some children.
There a man near the tree with a fire in front of him which he was lighting.
The two men made me climb the tree and took me into a house which was more
beautiful than any I had ever seen. In it were some old men, young men, women
and children. Then they took me out from there and made me climb further
up the tree and brought me into an even better and more beautiful house which
contained old men and young men. I said, "You have been my travel guides
for the whole night, so tell me about what I have seen." They said, "Certainly!
As for the one you saw whose jaw was being torn open, he was liar who told
lies that were relayed from him until they spread everywhere. So that is
what will be done to him until the Day of Rising. The man you saw whose head
was being crushed was someone to whom Allah had taught the Qur'an who used
to sleep without reciting it at night and did not act by it during the day.
That will be done to him until the Day of Rising. Those you saw in the hole
are the fornicators. The man you saw in the river consumed usury. The old
man at the foot of the tree was Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and the children
around him are people's children. The one who was kindling the fire was Malik,
the Guardian of the Fire. The first house you entered was the house of the
generality of believers. This house is the house of those killed fighting
in the way of Allah. I am Jibril and this Mika'il. Raise your head." I raised
my head and above me was something like a cloud. They said, "This is your
destined place." I said, "Let me enter my place." They said, "You still have
some of your life left which has not been completed. If it were complete,
you would have come to your place."'"

Abu Bakr and he said, 'In how many cloths was the Prophet, may Allah bless

without a shirt or a turban." Hisham's father said, "He said to her, 'On
what day did the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
die?' She said, 'Monday.' He asked, 'What day is this?' She said, 'Monday.'
He said, 'I hope it will be between now and tonight.' He looked at a garment
he was wearing during his illness and it had a saffron stain on it. He said,
'Wash this garment and add two other garments to it and shroud me in it.'
I said, 'It is worn out.' He said, 'The living have more right to new things
than the dead. It is only to absorb the pus.' He did not die until the evening
of Tuesday and was buried before morning."

</B>

and in which the dead are buried.
<P>

<P>
1324. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said in his final illness, "Allah cursed the Jews and the

However, I am still afraid that it might be made into a mosque."

down in the time of al-Walid ibn 'Abdu'l-Malik, they began to rebuild it
and a foot appeared. They were alarmed, thinking it to be the foot of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. No one could be found who
knew about it until 'Urwa said to them, 'No, by Allah, it is not the foot
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. It is only the foot
of 'Umar.'"
<P>
1327. Hisham's father related that 'A'isha made a will to 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr
saying, "Do not bury me with them. Bury me with my companions in al-Baqi'.
I would hate to be thought purer because of it."
<P>
1328. It is related that 'Amr ibn Maymun al-Awdi said, "I saw 'Umar ibn
al-Khattab say, 'O 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar! Go to the Umm al-Mu'minin, 'A'isha
and say, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab sends greeting to you." Then ask her if I
can be buried with my two companions.' She said, 'I had wanted that for myself,
but today I prefer him to myself.' When he returned, 'Umar said, 'What news
do you have?' He said, 'She gives you permission, Amir al-Muminin.' He said,
'Nothing is more important to me than to be laid there. When I die, carry
me there and then greet her and say, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab asks permission."
If she gives permission, then bury me. Otherwise, take me back to the graves
of the Muslims. I do not know of anyone more entitled to do this task than
those people with whom the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was pleased when he died. Whoever is chosen to be the khalif after
me is the khalif, so listen to him and obey him.' Then he named 'Uthman,
'Ali, Talha, az-Zubayr, 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas.
A young man of the Ansar came in and said, 'Amir al-Mu'minin, rejoice in
the good news of Allah. You came early to Islam, as you know, then you became
the khalif and were just and then, after all that, death in the way of Allah.'
He said, 'Nephew, I only hope that that is sufficient so that nothing remains
for me nor against me. I advise the khalif after me to be good to the first
Muhajirun, to acknowledge their right and to preserve respect (<I>hurma</I>)
for them. I advise him to be good to the Ansar who possessed the abode and
belief, to accept their good and overlook their bad. I advise him to fulfil
the contract of the dhimma of Allah and the <I>dhimma</I> of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and to fight for them
and not to burden them with more than they can bear.'"
