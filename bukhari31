It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "We went out with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on one of his journeys until, whenwe had reached al-Bayda, or Dhat al-Jaysh, my necklace broke and the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stayed to look for itand everyone else stayed with him. There was no water there, so the peoplewent to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, 'Look what 'A'isha has done. She hascaused the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andeveryone else to halt at a place where there is no water for them nor arethey carrying any water with them?' Abu Bakr came and found that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had gone to sleep withhis head against my thigh. He said, 'You have held up the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and everyone else in a place wherethere is no water and they are not carrying any water with them!' Abu Bakrrebuked me saying what Allah wished him to say and started to poke me inthe side with his hand and the only reason I did not move was that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was against my thigh.At first light the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, did <I>tayammum</I>." Usayd ibn al-Hudayr said, 'Family of Abu Bakr,this is not the first blessing you have brought!'." 'A'isha continued, "Wemade the camel I was on get up and found the necklace underneath it."<P>4332. It is related from 'A'isha, "A necklace of mine dropped at al-Bayda'while we were on our way to Madina and the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, made his camel kneel and dismounted. He laid his head inmy lap and slept. Abu Bakr came and hit me hard on the chest and said, 'Youhave held up the people on account of a necklace!' I kept still as deathbecause of the position of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, although he had hurt me. Then the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, woke up and it was time for <I>Subh</I>. Water waslooked for but nnt found. Then it was revealed,<I> 'O you who believe! Whenyou you get up to do the prayer....</I>' (5:6) Usayd ibn Hudayr said, 'Allahhas blessed the people on account of you, family of Abu Bakr! You are onlya blessing for them.'"<P><P><B>CXI:<I> "So you and your Lord go and fight. We will stay sitting here."</I>(5:24)</B><P>4333. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "On the day of Badr, al-Miqdad said,'Messenger of Allah, we will not say to you what the tribe of Israel saidto Musa: <I>"So you and your Lord go and fight. We will stay sitting here."</I>(5:24) Go and we are with you.' That seemed to cheer up the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."<P>It is related from Tariq that al-Miqdad said that to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>CXII:<I> "The reprisal against those who wage war on Allah and His Messenger,and go about the earth corrupting it, is that they should be killed orcrucified,or have their alternate hands and feet cut off, or be banishedfrom the land."</I> (5:33)</B><P>Waging war against Allah is rejecting Him.<P>4334. It is related from Abu Qilaba that he he was sitting behind 'Umar ibn'Abdu'l-'Aziz, and they mentioned this and they mentioned that [about<I>Qasama</I>] and they said various things, saying that the khalifs hadtaken retaliation on account of it. He turned to Abu Qilaba who was behindhim and asked, "What do you say, 'Abdullah ibn Zayd?" or he asked, "Whatdo you say, Abu Qilaba?" "I said, 'I do not know that it is lawful to killa soul in Islam except for a man who has committed fornication after havingbeen married, or someone who has murdered someone without right, or someonewho makes war against Allah and His Messenger, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.' 'Anbasa said, 'And Anas related such-and-such and such-and-such.'I said, 'Anas related to me and said, "Some people came to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and spoke to him, saying, 'This landmakes us ill.' He said, 'These are some of our camels which are being takenout. So go out with them and drink some of their milk and urine.' So theywent out with them and drank some of their milk and urine and recovered theirhealth. Then they turned on the herdsman and killed him and drove off thecamels." why should there be any delay with those men? They killed a personand made war against Allah and His Messenger and alarmed the Messenger ofAllah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said, 'Glory be to Allah!'I said, 'Do you suspect me?' He said, 'Anas related that.'" He said,'Thenhe said, 'O people of such-and-such! You will remain in good as long as thisman and his like remain among you.'"<P><P><B>CXIII:<I> "Retaliation for wounds.." </I>(5:45)</B><P>4335. It is related that Anas said, "Ar-Rubayya', the aunt of Anas ibn Malik,broke the tooth of a girl of the Ansar. The people asked for retaliationand they went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered retaliation.Anas ibn an-Nadr, the uncle of Anas ibn Malik, said, 'No, by Allah, her toothwill not be broken, Messenger of Allah!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'O Anas, the Book of Allah statesretaliation.' Then the people were satisfied and accepted compensation. TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Thereare some of the slaves of Allah who, if they took an oath, Allah would fulfilit.'"<P><P><B>CLIV: <I>"O Messenger! Deliver what has been sent down to you from yourLord."</I> (5:67)</B><P>4336. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Whoever tells you that Muhammad,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, concealed something of what wasrevealed to him has lied. Allah says, <I>'O Messenger! Deliver what has beensent down to you from your Lord.' </I>(5:67)"<P><P><B>CLV:<I> "Allah does not take you to task for your inadvertent oaths."</I>(5:89)</B><P>4337. It is related from 'A'isha, "This <I>ayat</I>,<I> 'Allah does not takeyou to task for your inadvertent oaths,' </I>(5:89) was sent down about aman saying, 'No, by Allah,' and 'Yes, by Allah.'"<P>4338. It is related from 'A'isha that her father used to never break an oathuntil Allah revealed the expiation for the oath. Abu Bakr then said, 'IfI ever see something better than an oath, I will accept the dispensationof Allah and do that which is better.'"<P><P><B>CLVI: His words,<I> " O you who believe, do not make unlawful the goodthings Allah has made lawful for you."</I> (5:87)</B><P>4339. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "We used to go on expeditions withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and there were no womenwith us. We asked, 'Shall we castrate ourselves?' He forbade us to do thatand after that made an allowance for us that we could marry a woman for aprice. Then he recited, '<I>"O you who believe, do not make unlawful thegood things Allah has made lawful for you.'</I> (5:87)"<P><P><B>CLVII: His words, <I>"Wine, gambling, stone altars and divining arrowsare filth from the handiwork of Shaytan." </I>(5:90)</B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said that "<I>azlam</I>" are arrows which used for divinationin things and "<I>nusub</I>" are stones set up on which sacrifices are made.<P>Someone else said that "<I>zalam</I>" is the arrow without a feather, beingthe singular of <I>azlam</I>. Divination is that the arrows are turned round,and the casting prohibits it, then he leaves, and if it commands it, thenhe does what it commands. They gave the arrows signs for use in the variousmatters in which they sought divination. When you do it, you say, "I divined"of which the verbal noun is <I>qus&ucirc;m</I>. <I>"Yuj&icirc;l"</I> meansto turn round.<P>4340. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "When the prohibition of wine wassent down, at that time there five kinds of intoxicants in Madina, not oneof which was the drink produced from grapes."<P>4341. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We had no wine except thatwhich you call <I>fadikh</I> (from dates). I was standing giving drink toAbu Talha, so-and-so, and so-and-so when a man came and said, 'Has the newsreached you?' They said, 'And what is that?' He said, 'Wine has been madeunlawful.' They said, 'Anas, pour out these pots!'" He said, "They did notask about it nor return to it after the man's news.<P>4342. It is related that Jabir said, "In the morning of Uhud some peopledrank wine and they were all killed on that day as martyrs. That was beforeit was prohibited."<P>4343. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "I heard 'Umar say on minbar ofthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Following on fromthat, O people! The prohibition against wine was sent down and they are fromfive - from grapes, dates, honey, wheat and barley. Wine is what befuddlesthe intellect.'"<P><P><B>CLVIII: "<I>Those who believe and do right actions are not to blame forwhat they have eaten</I>." (5:93)</B><P>4344. It is related that Anas said, "The wine which was spilled out was<I>fadikh</I> (date wine)."<P>Anas said, "I was serving the drink to the people in the house of Abu Talhawhen the prohibition against wine was revealed and someone was commandedto announce it. Abu Talha said, 'So go and see what this noise is.'" He said,"I went out and said, 'This is an announcer annouching that wine has beenmade unlawful.' He said to me, 'Go and spill it out.'" He said, 'It flowedin the streets of Madina." He said, "Their wine that day was <I>fadikh</I>.Some people said, 'People were killed with wine in their stomachs.' He said,'So Allah sent down<I>, 'Those who believe and do right actions are not toblame for what they have eaten.'</I> (5:93)"<P><P><B>CLIX: <I>"Do not ask about matters which, if they were made known to you,would make things difficult for you." </I>(5:101)</B><P>4345. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, addressed us in a speech the like of which I havenever heard. He said, ''If you knew what I know, you would laugh little andweep much.' The Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, covered their faces and sobbed. A man said, 'Who ismy father?' He said, 'So-and-so.' Then this ayat was sent down: <I>'Do notask about matters which, if they were made known to you, would make thingsdifficult for you.' </I>(5:101)"<P>4346. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Some people used to question theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in mockery anda said would say, 'Who is my father?' and a man whose camel was lost wouldsay, 'Where is my camel?' and so Prophet sent down this <I>ayat</I> aboutthem: <I>'Do not ask about matters which, if they were made known to you,would make things difficult for you....' </I>(5:101)"<P><P>CXX: "Allah did not institute any such thing as bahira or sa'iba or wasilaor hami."

"<I>Idh</I>'here is a conjunction.<P>The root of <I>ma'ida</I> (table) is a past particle, like "a pleasing life"(<I>'isha</I>) and final divorce (<I>tatliqa</I>).

It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "The <I>bahira</I> isthe camel whose milk is reserved for the idols. No one can milk it. The<I>sa'ib </I>is the nimalthey used to let go free as devoted to their gods,and nothing could be carried on it."<P>He said that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'I saw 'Amr ibn 'Amir al-Khuza'i dragging hisintestines in the Fire. He was the first to let animals graze freely [forthe idols].' The <I>wasila</I> is the young she-camel whose gives birth firstto a she-camel and then a female after a female. They used to let graze freelyas devoted to their idols those camels which gave birth to two females withno male in between. The <I>hami</I> was the male camel used for breeding.When its breeding was over, they left it for the idols and exempted it fromcarrying loads. Nothing was carried on it. They called it the <I>hami</I>."<P>This is related from Sa'id.<P>Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the like of it from the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace."<P>It is related from Abu Hurayra, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace."<P>4348. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'I saw portions of Jahannam destroyingone another and I saw 'Amr dragging his intestines. He was first to let animalsgraze freely which were devoted to the idols."<P><P><B>CXXI: <I>"I was a witness against them as long as I remained among them,but when You took me back to You, You were the Watcher over them. You areWitness of all things."</I> (5:117)</B><P>4349. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, gave a <I>khutba</I> and said, 'O people!You will be gathered to Allah barefoot, naked, uncircumcised. Then He said,<I>'As We originated the first creation so We will regenerate it. It is a promisebinding on Us. That is what We will do.' </I>(21:104) Then he said, 'Thefirst of creatures to be dressed on the Day of Rising will be Ibrahim. Somemen of my community will be taken to the left side and I will say, "O Lord,my Companions!" It will be said, "You do not know what they originated afteryou." I will say as the righteous slave said, <I>"I was a witness againstthem as long as I remained among them, but when You took me back to You,You were the Watcher over them. You are Witness of all things." </I>(5:117)It will be said, "Those continued to be apostates since the time you leftthem."'"<P><P><B>CXXII: <I>"If You punish them, they are Your slaves. If you forgive them,You are the Almighty, the All-Wise."</I> (5:118)</B><P>4350.

It is related that Ibn Abi Mulayka said about Ibn 'Abbas when therewas a disagreement between him and Ibn az-Zubayr, "I said, 'His father wasaz-Zubayr and his mother Asma'. His maternal aunt was 'A'isha and his grandfatherAbu Bakr and his grandmother Safiyya.'"<P>4388. It is related that Ibn Abi Mulayka said, "There was a disagreementbetween them and I went to Ibn 'Abbas and said, 'Do you mean to fight Ibnaz-Zubayr? Will you make the Haram of Allah profane?' He said, 'I seek refugewith Allah! Allah has written that Ibn az-Zubayr and the Banu Umayya (Umayyads)would permit it, but I, by Allah, would never make it lawful.' He said, 'Peoplesaid said, "Give allegiance to Ibn az-Zubayr." I said, "How would this businessbe taken from him? His father was the helper of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, i.e. az-Zubayr. His grandfather was the companionin the Cave, i.e. Abu Bakr. His mother was "She of the two belts,' i.e. Asma'.His maternal aunt was the Mother of the Believers, i.e. 'A'isha, and hispaternal aunt was the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, i.e. Khadija. The paternal aunt of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was his grandmother, i.e. Safiyya. Then he is abstinentin Islam, a reciter of Qur'an. By Allah, If they (the Umayyads) bring meclose by kinship, they do so by close kinship, and if they rule me, noblepeers rule me. So he preferred little Tuwayb, Usama and Hamd,"' he meantsub-tribes of the Banu Asad: the Banu Tuwayb, Banu Usama and Banu Asad. IbnAbi'l-'As emerged advancing boldly, i.e. 'Abdu'l-Malik ibn Marwan, whilehe, i.e. Ibn az-Zubayr, fell back on his tail."<P>4389. Ibn Abi Mulayka reported, "We went to visit Ibn 'Abbas and he said,"Are you not surprised at Ibn az-Zubayr assuming this business? I said, 'Iwill put myself on his behalf as I did not do for Abu Bakr and 'Umar,' andthey were more entitled to every good than he is. I said, 'He is the sonof the paternal aunt of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and the son of az-Zubayr, the grandson of Abu Bakr, the son of Khadija'sbrother, and the son 'A'isha's sister.' However, he holds himself above meand does not desire that. I said, 'I did not think that he would turn awayfrom this on my account and leave it. I do not think that he desires goodfor me. So if it must be, I prefer that the descendants of my uncle me thanother people ruling me.'"<P><P><B>CLVIII: <I>"Reconciling people's hearts" </I>(9:60)</B><P>Mujahid said that they are reconciled by gifts.<P>4390.

The hypocrites said, 'Allahdoes not need this man's <I>sadaqa</I>, and this other man only did it toshow off.' Then it was revealed: <I>'As for the people who find fault withthe believers who spontaneously give sadaqa, and with those who can findnothing to give but their own effort.' </I>(9:79)"<P>4392. It is related that Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari said, "When the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to instruct us to give<I>sadaqa</I>, we would work and get work to earn a <I>mudd</I>.

Then he asked him to pray over himand the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gotup to pray. Then 'Umar got up and grabbed hold of his garment, saying 'Messengerof Allah, will you pray over him when Allah has forbidden you to pray overhim?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Allah has given me a choice. He says, <I>"You can ask forgiveness for them,or not ask forgiveness for them. Even if you asked forgiveness for them seventytimes, Allah still would not forgive them." </I>(9:80) So I do more thanseventy.' He said, 'He is a hypocrite.'" He said, "So the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over him and then Allah sentdown, <I>'Do not ever pray over any of them who die or stand at their graves.'</I>(9:84)"<P>4394. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "When 'Abdullah ibn Ubayyibn Salul died, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, was asked to pray over him. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, stood, I got up quickly to him and said,'Messenger of Allah, are you going to pray over Ibn Ubayy when he saidsuch-and-such and such-and-such' and he recounted what he had said. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smiled and said, ''Umar,get away from me.' When I kept at him too much, he said, 'I have been givena choice and I have chosen. If I knew that he would be forgiven if I didit more than seventy times, I would do it.'" He said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over him and then left. Shortlyafter that, the two <I>ayats</I> of <I>Bara'a </I>were sent down: <I>'Donot ever pray over any of them who die or stand at their graves.

It is related from Ibn 'Umar, "When 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy died, his son,'Abdullah ibn 'Abdullah, came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and he give him his shirt and he commanded him toshroud him in it. Then he got up to pray over him and. 'Umar ibn al-Khattabgrabbed hold of his garment, saying 'Will you pray over him when he is ahypocrite and Allah has forbidden you to ask forgiveness for him?'

Even if you asked forgiveness for them seventytimes, Allah still would not forgive them</I>." (9:80)' He said, 'So I domore than seventy.'" He said, "So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, prayed over him and then Allah sent down on him,'<I>'Do not ever pray over any of them who die or stand at their graves.They rejected Allah and His Messenger and died while degenerate.'</I> (9:84)"<P><P><B>CLXII: His words, <I>"They will swear to you by Allahwhen you return tothem, so that you leave them alone. Leave them alone, then! They are defilement.Their shelter will be Hell as repayment for what they earned."</I> (9:95)</B><P>4396. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik said, "I heard Ka'bibn Malik say when he stayed behind Tabuk, 'By Allah, after His guiding me,Allah did not bestow on me any blessing greater than my truthfulness to theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so that thatI did not lie to him and get destroyed as those who lied were destroyed whenthe revelation was sent down:<I> 'They will swear to you by Allahwhen youreturn to them, so that you leave them alone.

It may well be that Allahwill turn towards them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful."</I>(9:102)</B><P>4397. It is related that Samura ibn Jundub said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to us, 'In the night, two mencame to me and woke me up and took me to a city constructed with gold andsilver bricks. There some men met us. Half of their physique was the mosthandsome you have ever seen and the other half like the ugliest you haveever seen. The two said to them, "Go and get into that river," and they wentdown into it and then returned to us and that evil had left them. They thenhad the some handsome form. The two said to me, "This is the Garden of 'Adnand that is your dwelling." They said, "As for the people who were half handsomeand half ugly, they mixed righteous deeds with evil deeds, but Allah overlookedthat for them."'"<P><P><B>CLXV: <I>"It is not right for the Prophet and those who believe to askforgiveness for the idolaters."</I> (9:113)</B><P>4398. It is related from the father of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, "When Abu Talibwas near death, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cameto him and found Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya with him. The Prophet,mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said to Abu Talib, 'Uncle, say, "Thereis no god but Allah", and I will testify before Allah that you said it.'Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya said, 'Abu Talib! Will you turn fromthe religion of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib?' The Prophet said, 'By Allah, I will continueto ask for forgiveness for you as long as I am not forbidden to do it foryou.'

Then He turned towards them&#150; He is All-Gentle, Most Merciful to them."</I> (9:117)</B><P>4399. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b, who was the one of Ka'b's sonswho guided him when he went blind, who said, "I heard Ka'b ibn Malik sayin his account about, 'to the three who remained behind,' and he said atthe end of it, 'Part of my repentance was that I divested myself of my propertyas <I>sadaqa</I> for Allah and His Messenger. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Keep some of your property. It will be betterfor you."'"<P><P><B>CLXVII:<I> "And also towards the three who were left behind, so that whenthe earth became narrow for them, for all its great breadth, and their ownselves became constricted for them and they realised that there was no refugefrom Allah except in Him, He turned towards them so that they might turnto Him. Allah is the Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful." </I>(9:118)</B><P>4400. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik said, "I heard my father,Ka'b ibn Malik, who was one of the three who were forgiven, say that he didnot stay behind the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, on any another expedition he made at all except for two expeditions:the Hardship expedition [i.e. Tabuk] and the expedition to Badr. He said,'I resolved to tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, in the morning. It was rare that he would come froma journey he made other than in the forenoon. He would first go to the mosqueand pray two <I>rak'ats</I>. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, forbade people to speak to me and my two companions, but he did notforbid that for any others except us out of all those who had remained behindhim. So the people avoided speaking to us, and things remained like thatuntil the business went on too long for me. There was nothing I worried aboutmore than dying and not having the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, pray over me, or the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, dying while while I wasamong the people in that position,and them none of them would speak to me or pray over me. Then Allah sentdown our repentance to His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,when a third of the night remained while the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was with Umm Salama. Umm Salama had been friendlyin my business, and trying to help my situation. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Umm Salama! Ka'b has beenturned to.' She said, 'Should I send to him to give him the good news?' Hesaid, 'Then people would crowd to you and keep you from sleeping the restof the night.' Then when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, had prayed <I>Fajr</I>, he announced that Allah had turnedto us. When he was happy, his face shone as if it were a part of the moon.We three were left apart from those who made excuses which were acceptedwhen Allah sent down repentance to us. When those who lied to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, among those who stayedbehind and made false excuses were mentioned, they were mentioned in theworst possible way anyone could be mentioned. Allah - glory be to Him! said,<I>"They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say: 'Do not makeexcuses, we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us about you.Allah will see your actions, as will His Messenger.'...' </I>(9:94)"<P><P><B>CLXVIII: <I>"O who you believe! Fear Allah and be with the truthful."</I>(9:119)</B><P>4401. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b, who was the who guide of Ka'bibn Malik, said, "I heard Ka'b ibn Malik relate his account of when he stayedbehind the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, inthe story of to Tabuk. He said, 'By Allah, I do not know of anyone whom Allahhas tested more in truthful speech in a better way than He has tested me.Since I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, I have not inclined to a lie until this very day. Allah,the Mighty and Exalted, sent down on His Messenger, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, <I>'Allah has turned towards the Prophet, and the Muhajirunand the Ansar ... and be with the truthful.' </I>(9:117-119)"<P><P><B>CLXIX:<I> "A Messenger has come to you from among yourselves.

It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit al-Ansari , one of those who wrotedown the revelation, said, "After the slaughter in the war of Yamama, AbuBakr sent for me, and 'Umar was with him. Abu Bakr said, ''Umar has cometo me and said, "Many people were killed int he Battle of Yamama, and I fearthat many Qur'an reciters will be killed in other places and so much of theQur'an will be lost unless you collect it. I think that you should collectthe Qur'an together."' Abu Bakr said, 'I said to 'Umar, "How can I do somethingwhich the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, didnot do?" 'Umar said, "By Allah, it is better." 'Umar kept at me about ituntil Allah opened my breast to it. I think what 'Umar thinks.'" Zayd ibnThabit said, "'Umar was sitting with him, not speaking. Abu Bakr said, 'Youare an intelligent young man and we have no doubts about you. You used towrite down the revelation for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace. Therefore you are to search out the Qur'an and collectit.' By Allah, if he had obliged me to move one of the mountains, that wouldnot have been weightier for me than what he commanded to do of collectingthe Qur'an. I said, 'How can the two of you do something How can I do somethingwhich the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, didnot do?' Abu Bakr said, 'By Allah, it is better.' He continued to keep atme until Allah opened my breast to what Allah had opened the breasts of AbuBakr and 'Umar. So I began to search out the Qur'an and collect it from theparchments, shoulder-blades, palm stalks and the breasts of men until I foundtwo <I>ayats</I> of <I>Surat at-Tawba</I> with Khuzayma al-Ansari which Idid not find with anyone else: <I>'A Messenger has come to you from amongyourselves.
