<P>
<B>I: The virtues of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased
with them</B>
<P>
Any Muslim who kept the company of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, or saw him is one of his Companions.
<P>
3449. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A time will come to people
when groups of people will go on expedition. They will say, 'Is there any
among you who kept the company of the Messenger of Allah?' They will say,
Yes.' And victory will be given to them. Then a time will come to people
when it will be said, 'Is there any among you who kept the company of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah?' They will say, 'Yes.' And victory
will be given to them. Then a time will come to people when groups of people
will go on expedition. It will be said, 'Is there any among you who kept
the company of the companions of the Companions of the Prophet?' They will
say, 'Yes.' And victory will be given to them."
<P>
3450. It is related that 'Imran ibn al-Husayn was heard to say that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The best of my
community are my generation and then those who follow them and then those
who follow them." 'Imran said, "I do not know whether the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said it twice or three times." "Then after
them will come a people who testify when they are not asked to testify, who
betray and are not trustworthy, and who make a vow and do not fulfil it.
Fleshiness will appear among them."
<P>
3451. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The best of people are my generation and then
those who follow them and then those who follow them. Then there will come
people whose testimony will precede their oaths and whose oaths will precede
their testimony."
<P>
Ibrahim said, "They used to beat us for rushing to testify and avow when
we young."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The virtues and excellence of the Muhajirun</B>
<P>
They include Abu Bakr 'Abdullah ibn Abi Quhafa at-Taymi, may Allah be pleased
with him.
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"It is for the poor of the Muhajirun who
were driven from their homes and wealth desiring the favour and the pleasure
of Allah and supporting Allah and His Messenger. Such people are the truly
sincere."</I> (59:8) He also said, <I>"If you do not help him, Allah did
help him when those who reject drove him out, when there were two of them
in the Cave. He said to his companion, 'Do not be despondent, Allah is with
us.'" </I>(9:40)
<P>
'A'isha, Abu Sa'id, and Ibn 'Abbas said, "Abu Bakr was with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the Cave."
<P>
3452. It is related that al-Bara' said, "Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from
'Azib for thirty dirhams. Abu Bakr said to 'Azib, 'Tell al-Bara' to carry
my saddle for me.' 'Azib said, 'No, not until you relate to us what happened
when you and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
left Makka and the idolaters were pursuing you.' He said, 'We left Makka
and travelled through the night and part of the following day until it was
the middle of day and the sun was high. My eyes searched to see if I could
see any shade where I could find shelter, and there was a rock. I went to
it and it still had some shade left. I levelled it and spread out a place
for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to sleep there
Then I said to him, "Lie down, O Prophet of Allah!" So the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, laid down. Then I went to look around me to
see whether I saw any one in pursuit. There was a shepherd driving his sheep
towards the rock, intending what we had intended from it. I asked him, "Whose
servant are you?" He mentioned a man of Quraysh and named him. I knew him.
I asked, "Do your sheep have any milk?' He replied, "Yes.' I said, "Will
you milk for us?" He said, "Yes." Then I commanded him to hobble one of his
sheep. Then I commanded him to clean the dust from the teats and then I told
him to clean his hands. (He said, 'Like that,') and clapped his hands together.
He milked a little milk for me. I put it in a small pot for the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and put a rag over its
mouth. I poured water over the milk until its bottom was cold. Then I went
to the Messenger of Allah who I found had woken up and said, "Drink, Messenger
of Allah.' He drank so that I was pleased. Then I said, "Is it time to leave,
Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Yes indeed." So we travelled whilw the people
seeking us. None of them caught up to us except for Suraqa ibn Malik ibn
Ju'shum on a horse of his. I said, "This seeker has caught us, Messenger
of Allah!" He said, "Do not grieve. Allah is with us."'"
<P>
3453. It is related that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq said, "When we were in the Cave
and the idolaters were looking for us, I could see their feet and said, 'O
Messenger of Allah, if one of them were to look under his feet, he would
see us.' He said, 'Abu Bakr, what do you think of two people of whom Allah
is the third?'""
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The words of the Prophet, "Close up the doorways, except for that
of Abu Bakr."</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas reported it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace/
<P>
3454. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave a <I>khutba</I> and said, 'Allah
gave one of His slaves a choice between this world and what is with Allah.
That slave chose what is with Allah.'" He said, "Abu Bakr wept, and we were
astonished by his weeping at the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, reporting that a slave had been given a choice. However,
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was the
slave referred to and Abu Bakr knew more than we did. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Abu Bakr has been, of all
people, the most generous to me both with regard to his company and his property.
If I were to have made a close friend of any of my community other than my
Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr, but we have the brotherhood and love of
Islam. Let there not remain any private doorways into the mosque except that
of Abu Bakr.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The excellence of Abu Bakr after the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace</B>
<P>
3455. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "We used to put people in order
of preference in the time of the Prophet, and we preferred Abu Bakr, then
'Umar ibn al-Khattab, then 'Uthman ibn 'Affan ."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"If I were to have taken a close friend..."</B>
<P>
Abu Sa'id said it.
<P>
3456. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "If I were to have taken a close friend, I
would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend, but he is my brother and my
Companion."
<P>
3457. It is related that Ayyub said that he said, "If I were to have taken
a close friend, I would have taken him as a close friend, but the brotherhood
of Islam is better,"
<P>
The like of it is related from Ayyub.
<P>
3458. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Mulayka said, "The people of Kufa
wrote to Ibn az-Zubayr regarding the inheritance of the grandfather. He said,
'According to that which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said. He said, "If I were to have taken a close friend,
I would have taken him," and he i.e. Abu Bakr, made him (the grandfather)
like the father.
<P>
3459. It is related that Jubayr ibn Mut'im said, "A woman came to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he commanded her to come back
to him. She said, 'What do you think if I come and do not find you,' as if
she meant death. He said, 'If you do not find me, then go to Abu Bakr.'"
<P>
3460. It is related that 'Ammar said, "I saw the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, when there were only with him five slaves,
two men, and Abu Bakr."
<P>
3461. It is related that Abu'd-Darda' said, "I was sitting with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when Abu Bakr came, holding the
end of his garment so that he uncovered his knee. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Your companion has had a quarrel.'
He greeted and said, 'There was a disagreement between me and Ibn al-Khattab.
I spoke hashly to him and then regretted it. I asked him to forgive me and
he refused, so I came to you. He said, 'May Allah forgive you, Abu Bakr'
three times. Then 'Umar regretted that and went to Abu Bakr's house and asked,
'Is Abu Bakr there?' They said, 'No.' So he went to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and gave the greeting, crossness showed in
the &nbsp;face of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so
that Abu Bakr had compassion and knelt and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, by
Allah, I was more in the wrong,' twice. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'Allah sent me to you and you said, "You lied,"
while Abu Bakr affirmed and consoled me with himself and his property, Will
you not leave me my Companion?' twice, and he was not injured after that."
<P>
3462. It is related from 'Amr ibn al-'As that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, put him in charge of the army of Dhat as-Salasil.
"I went to him and asked, 'Which person is the most beloved to you?' He replied,
''A'isha.' I said, 'Which of the men?' He answered, 'Her father.' I said,
'Then who?' He said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab,' and he mentioned a number of
men."
<P>
3463. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'While a shepherd was
tending&nbsp;his flock, a wolf came and seized one of the sheep and the shepherd
pursued it. The wolf said, "Who will guard it on the Day of Gathering when
they will have no shepherd but me?" While a man was driving a cow, he mounted
on it and it turned to him and said, "I was not created for this. I was created
for ploughing."' The people said, 'Glory be to Allah!' The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I, Abu Bakr and 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
believe it."
<P>
3464. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, "While I was asleep, I dreamt that I
was at a well in which there was a bucket. I drew water with it for as long
as Allah willed and then Ibn Abi Quhafa took it and drew one or two buckets,
but there was some weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him for his
weakness. Then it turned into a large bucket and Ibn al-Khattab took it and
I have not seen a leader among the people work so well as he did until the
people watered their camels."
<P>
3465. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever drags his garment
out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Rising." Abu Bakr
said, "One side of my garment hangs down unless I pay attention to it." The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "You do
not do that out of pride."
<P>
Musa said, "I said to Salim, 'Did 'Abdullah mention "the one who drags his
wrapper"?' He said, 'I only heard him mention his "garment".'"
<P>
3466. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'The one who spends out two
kinds of actions in the way of Allah will be summoned from the gates - i.e.
of the Garden - and told, "O slave of Allah, this is better." All the people
who did the prayer will be called from the gate of the prayer. All the people
who did <I>jihad</I> will be called from the gate of <I>jihad</I>. All the
people who gave <I>sadaqa</I> will be called from the gate of <I>sadaqa</I>.
All the people who fasted will be called from the gate of fasting, and the
gate of Rayyan. ' Abu Bakr said, 'No one called from those gates will feel
distress.' He said, 'Will anyone be called from all those gates, Messenger
of Allah?' He said, 'Yes, and I hope that you will be among them, Abu Bakr.'"
<P>
3467. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died while Abu Bakr was
at as-Sunh. (Isma'il says that it means at al-'Aliyya). 'Umar stood up saying,
'By Allah, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
has not died!'" She said, ''Umar said [later], 'By Allah, nothing occurred
to me but that." [He said], 'Allah will raise him and he will cut off the
hands and feets of some men!' Abu Bakr came and uncovered the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and kissed him. He said,
'By my mother and my father, you were good both alive and dead. By the One
who has no soul in His hand, Allah will not ever make you taste two deaths.
' Then he went out and said, 'O oath-taker, take it easy. When Abu Bakr spoke,
'Umar sat down. He praised Allah and glorified Him and said, 'Whoever worshipped
Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. Whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and
does not die.' He said, <I>'You will die and they too will die.'</I> (39:30)
He said, <I>'Muhammad is only a Messenger and he has been preceded by other
Messengers. If he was to die or be killed, would you turn on your heels?
Those who turn on their heels do not harm Allah in any way. Allah will recompense
the thankful.' </I>(3:144) The people sobbed."
<P>
He said, "The Ansar gathered around Sa'd ibn 'Ubada in the Saqifa of the
Banu Sa'ida. They said, 'There should be an amir from us and an amir from
you.' Abu Bakr, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, and Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah went
to them. 'Umar started to speak and Abu Bakr made him be quiet. 'Umar used
to say, 'By Allah, I only meant by that some words which I had prepared which
I liked. I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not be eloquent. Then Abu Bakr
spoke and he spoke in the most eloquent fashion. He said in his words, "We
are the amirs and you are the wazirs."' Hubab ibn al-Mundhir said, 'No, by
Allah, we will not do it! An amir from us and an amir from you.' Abu Bakr
said, 'No, but we are the amirs and you are the wazirs, for they (i.e. Quraysh)
are the noblest house of the Arabs and the best in lineage. So give allegiance
to 'Umar or Abu 'Ubadya ibn al-Jarrah.' So 'Umar said, 'Rather we will give
allegiance to you! You are our master and the best of us and the one of us
most beloved to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and 'Umar took his hand and gave him allegiance, and the people gave
him allegiance. Someone said, 'You have killed Sa'd.' 'Umar replied, 'Allah
has killed him.'"
<P>
It is related that 'A'isha said, "The eyes of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, became fixed and then he said three times, 'Among
the highest Companion,'" He [al-Qasim] related the hadith. She said, "There
was nothing in what both of them said by which Allah did not benefit people.
&nbsp;'Umar frightened the people, some of whom were hypocrites and then
Allah caused them to apostasise because of that. Then Abu Bakr showed the
people guidance and acquainted them with the truth which they were following.
They went out reciting, '<I>Muhammad is only a Messenger and he has been
preceded by other Messengers. If he was to die or be killed, would you turn
on your heels? Those who turn on their heels do not harm Allah in any way.
Allah will recompense the thankful.'</I>"
<P>
3468. It is related that Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya said, "I asked my father
('Ali), 'Who was the best of people after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace?' He replied, 'Abu Bakr.' I said, 'Then who?'
He said, 'Then 'Umar,' and I was afraid that he would say 'Uthman, so I said,
'Then you?' He replied, 'I am only a man of the Muslims.'"
<P>
3469. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "We went
out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
on one of his journeys until, when we had reached al-Bayda, or Dhat al-Jaysh,
my necklace broke and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, stayed to look for it and everyone else stayed with him. There
was no water there, so the people went to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, 'Look
what 'A'isha has done. She has caused the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and everyone else to halt at a place where there
is no water for them nor are they carrying any water with them!' Abu Bakr
came and found that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, had gone to sleep with his head against my thigh. He said, 'You
have held up the Messenger of Allah and everyone else in a place where there
is no water and they are not carrying any water with them!' He rebuked me
saying what Allah wished him to say and started to poke me in the side with
his hand and the only reason I did not move was that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was against my thigh. At first light
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and
found that there was no water. Then Allah sent down the verse of
<I>tayammum</I>. So they did <I>tayammum</I>." Usayd ibn al-Hudayr said,
'Family of Abu Bakr, this is not the first blessing you have brought!'."
'A'isha continued, "We made the camel I was on get up and found the necklace
underneath it."
<P>
3470. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not abuse my Companions. By one
of you were to spend the like of Uhud in gold, he was not reach the
<I>mudd</I> or even a half of that of one of them."
<P>
Jarir, 'Abdullah ibn Dawud, Abu Mu'awiya, and Muhadir corroborated it from
al-A'mash.
<P>
3471. It is related from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that he did <I>wudu' </I>in
his house and then went out. [He said,] "I said, 'I will stay close to the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and be with
him on this day.'" He said, "He went to the mosque and asked where the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was and they said, 'He went there,'
indicating the direction he had gone. I followed after him asking about him
until he entered the Well of Aris. I sat at the gate, which was made of palm
branches, until the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace,&nbsp;had finished his need and was doing <I>wudu'.</I> I went up to
him and he was sitting at the Well of Aris on the middle of the rim with
his legs uncovered dangling into the well. I greeted him and then went and
sat at the gate. I said, 'I will be the doorkeeper of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, today.' Abu Bakr came and knocked
at the door. I said, 'Who is it?' He said, 'Abu Bakr.' I said, 'Hold on!'
I went and said, 'Messenger of Allah, it is Abu Bakr asking permission to
come in.' He said, 'Let him in and give him the good news of the Garden.'
I went and said to Abu Bakr, 'Enter and the Messenger of Allah gives you
the good news of the Garden.' Abu Bakr went in and sat at the right side
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the rim and dangled
his feet in the well as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, had done, uncovering his legs. Then I went back and sat down.
I had left my brother at home doing<I> wudu' </I>intending to join me. I
said, 'If Allah desires good for someone' - meaning his brother - 'He will
bring him.' Then a man moved the gate and I said, 'Who is it?' He said, ''Umar
ibn al-Khattab.' I said, 'Hold on!' Then I went to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and greeted him and said, 'It is
'Umar asking permission to come in.' He said, 'Let him in and give him the
good news of the Garden.' I went to 'Umar and said, 'Enter and the Messenger
of Allah gives you the good news of the Garden.' 'Umar went in and sat at
the left side of the Prophet* on the rim and dangled his feet in the well
like the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Then
I went back and sat down. I said, 'If Allah desires good for someone' - meaning
his brother - 'He will bring him.' Then a man moved the gate and I asked,
'Who is it?' He said, ''Uthman ibn 'Affan.' I said, 'Hold on!' Then I went
to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told him. He
said, 'Let him in and give him the good news of the Garden as well as an
affliction which will befall him.' I came and said, 'Enter and the Messenger
of Allah gives you the good news of the Garden as well as an affliction which
will befall you.' He entered and found the rim fully occupied, so he sat
opposite them on the other side." Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "I interpreted
it as their graves."
<P>
3472. It is related from Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, climbed Uhud with Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman, and it shook
with them. He said, "Be firm, Uhud, there is on you a Prophet, a true one,
and two martyrs."
<P>
3473. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "While I was at a well drawing
water, Abu Bakr and 'Umar came. Abu Bakr took the bucket and drew one or
two buckets, but there was some weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive
him. Then 'Umar took it from Abu Bakr's hand and it turned into a large bucket
in his hand. I have not seen a leader among the people work so well as he
did until the people watered their camels."
<P>
Wahb said that <I>'atan </I>is where camels kneel. He said, "until the camels
had their fill of water and knelt down."
<P>
3474. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I was standing among the people
who were making supplication to Allah for 'Umar ibn al-Khattab who had been
placed on his bed. A man behind me put his elbows on my shoulders, saying,
'May Allah have mercy on you. I hope that Allah will place you with your
two companions. I often heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, say, "I and Abu Bakr and 'Umar were..." and "I and Abu
Bakr and 'Umar did..." and "I and Abu Bakr and 'Umar set out." So I hope
that Allah will put you with them.' I turned and it was 'Ali ibn Abi Talib."
<P>
3475. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said, "I asked 'Abdullah ibn
'Amr about the worst thing that the idolaters did to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'I saw 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt
go to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was
praying and he put his cloak around his neck and began to choke him with
it severely. Abu Bakr came and pulled him away from him and said, 'Will you
kill a man for saying, "My Lord is Allah" when he has brought you clear signs
from his Lord?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The Virtues of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, Abu Hafs, al-Qurayshi al-'Adawi</B>
<P>
3476. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "I dreamt that I entered the Garden
and there was ar-Rumaysa', the wife of Abu Talha. I heard a faint sound and
said, 'Who is this?' He said, 'This is Bilal.' I saw a palace with a girl
in its courtyard and said, 'Who does this belong to?' They said, ''Umar.'
I wanted to enter it and look at it but then I remembered your jealousy.'
'Umar said, 'By my mother and father, Messenger of Allah, would I be jealous
on account of you?'"
<P>
[ar-Rumaysa' is Umm Sulaym]
<P>
3477. It is related that Abu Hurayra said,"While we were with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he said, 'While I was
asleep I saw myself in the Garden. There was a woman doing <I>wudu' </I>beside
a palace. I said, "To whom does this palace belong?" They answered, "To 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab." I remembered his jealousy and turned back.' 'Umar wept and
said, 'Would I have jealousy on account of you, Messenger of Allah?'"
<P>
3478. It is related from Hamza's father that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "While I was asleep, I dreamt
that I drank until I could feel moisture coming out of my nails and then
I gave it to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab." They asked, "How do you interpret it,
Messenger of Allah?" He replied, "It means knowledge."
<P>
3479. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "I dreamt that I was at a well drawing
water with a young camel's bucket, Abu Bakr came and drew one or two buckets,
but there was some weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him. Then 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab came and it turned into a large bucket in his hand. I have
not seen a leader among the people work so well as he did until the people
watered their camels."
<P>
Ibn Jubayr said, "<I>'Abqari </I>are the most excellent of carpets." Yahya
said that <I>zarabi</I> are carpets with a fine order. <I>Mabth&uuml;tha</I>
means many.
<P>
It is related from Muhammad ibn Sa'd that his father said.
<P>
3480. It is related that Sa'id ibn Abi Waqqas said, "'Umar asked the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for permission to enter
while there were some women of Quraysh with him who speaking to him and asking
him for more, raising their voices above his voice. When 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
asked for permission to enter, they rushed to screen themselves. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave him permission and
'Umar entered while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was laughing. 'Umar said, 'May Allah make you laugh, Messenger
of Allah.' He said, 'I am amazed at those women who were with me. When they
heard your voice, they rushed to screen themselves.' 'Umar said, 'But you,
Messenger of Allah, are more entitled to be feared.' Then he said, 'O enemies
of your selves! Do you fear me and not fear the Messenger of Allah?' They
said, 'Yes, you are harsher and more severe than the Messenger of Allah.'
The Messenger of Allah said, 'O Ibn al-Khattab! By the One in whose hand
my soul is, whenever Shaytan finds you taking a path, he only takes a path
other than your path.'"
<P>
3481. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "We have become mighty since 'Umar
became Muslim."
<P>
3482. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab who had been
placed on his bed, and the people gathered around him to make supplication
and pray before he was removed. I was among them. I was startled when a man
took hold of my shoulders, and it was 'Ali ibn Abi Talib. He asked for mercy
for 'Umar and said, 'You have not left behind anyone I would prefer to encounter
with the like of your actions. By Allah, I used to think that Allah would
put you with your two companions. I reckoned this as I often heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "I and Abu Bakr and
'Umar went..." and "I and Abu Bakr and 'Umar entered..." and "I and Abu Bakr
and 'Umar left."'"
<P>
3483. It is related from Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, climbed Uhud with Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman, and
it shook with them. He struck it with his foot and said, "Be firm, Uhud,
there is on you a Prophet, a true one, and two martyrs."
<P>
3484. It is related that Aslam said, "Ibn 'Umar asked me something about
him - i.e. 'Umar - and I told him." He said, "Since the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, I have not seen anyone more
serious and generous until he died than 'Umar ibn al-Khattab."
<P>
3485. It is related from Anas that a man asked the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, about the Final Hour and said, "When will the Hour
come?" He asked, "What have you prepared for it?" He replied, "Nothing, except
that I love of Allah and His Messenger." He said, "You will be with the one
you love." Anas said, "I love the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and Abu Bakr and "Umar, and I hope to be with them because of
my love for them, even if I do not perform actions like theirs."
<P>
3486. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Among those nations before you were those who
are inspired to action. If there are any of them among my community, then
it is 'Umar ibn al-Khattab."
<P>
It is added that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Among the tribe of Israel before you were men who
were spoken to without being Prophets. If there are any of them among my
community, then it is 'Umar."
<P>
3487. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "While a man was with his sheep, a wolf
attacked and went off with one of the sheep, and he went after it until he
rescued it. The wolf turned to him and said, 'Who will guard it on the day
of wild beasts, the day when they will have no shepherd but me?'" The people
said, "Glory be to Allah! A wolf that speaks!" He said, "I, Abu Bakr and
'Umar believe it," although they were not there.
<P>
3488. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'While I was asleep,
I dreamed I saw some people who were shown to me and who were wearing shirts
some of which reached to their breasts and some of which were shorter than
that. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab was shown to me wearing a shirt that was trailing
on the ground.' They asked, 'How do you interpret that, Messenger of Allah?'
He answered, 'The <I>deen</I>.'"
<P>
3489. It is related that al-Miswar ibn Makhrama said, "When 'Umar was stabbed,
be began to show pain and so Ibn 'Abbas said to him, as if he was trying
to assuage his disquiet, 'O Amir al-Mu'minin! If this has happened, you still
kept the company of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and were a good companion, and then you parted from him while
he was pleased with you. Then you kept the company of Abu Bakr and were a
good companion and you parted from him while he was pleased with you. Then
you kept their [the Muslims'] company and were a good companion. If you part
from them, you will part from them while they are pleased with you.' He said,
'As for what you mentioned about the company and pleasure of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that is a favour from
Allah, may His mention be exalted!, which He bestowed on me. As for what
you mentioned about the company and pleasure of Abu Bakr, that is a favour
from Allah Almighty which He bestowed on me. As for what you see of my disquiet,
it is on your account and on account of your companions. By Allah, if I were
to have gold enough to fill the earth, I would ransom myself with it from
the punishment of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic ,before I see Him.'"
<P>
This is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "I visited 'Umar."
<P>
3490. It is related that Abu Musa said, "I was with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, in one of the gardens of Madina when a man
came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'Open for him and give him the good news of the Garden.'
So I opened it for him and it was Abu Bakr. I gave him the good news of what
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said, and he praised
Allah. Then a man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Open for him and give him the good
news of the Garden.' So I opened it for him and it was 'Umar. I told him
what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said and he
praised Allah. Then a man came and asked me to open the gate and he said
to me, 'Open for him and give him the good news of the Garden for an affliction
which will befall him.' It was 'Uthman and I told him what the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said and he praised
Allah and then said, 'Allah is the One who is asked for help.'"
<P>
3491. It is related that Allah ibn Hisham said, "We were with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was holding 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
by the hand."

<B>VII: The Virtues of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan Abu 'Amr al-Qurashi</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The one who
digs the well of Ruma will have the Garden," and 'Uthman dug it. He said,
"The one who equips the army of Hardship will have the Garden," and it was
'Uthman who equipped it."
<P>
3492. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, entered a garden and commanded me to guard the door
of the Garden. A man came and asked for permission to enter. He said, 'Let
him in and give him the good news of the Garden.' It was Abu Bakr. Then another
came and asked for permission to enter and he said, 'Let him in and give
him the good news of the Garden.' It was 'Umar. Then another came and asked
for permission to enter and he was silent for a little while and then said,
'Let him him and give him the good news of the Garden for an affliction which
will befall him.' It was 'Uthman ibn 'Affan."
<P>
The like of it is related from Abu Musa and 'Asim added that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was sitting at a place where there
was water and had uncovered his knees - or his knee, and when 'Uthman entered,
he covered them.
<P>
3493. It is related that 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Adi ibn al-Khiyar reported, "Al-Miswar
ibn Makhrama and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Aswad ibn 'Abdu Yaghuth said, 'What
prevents you from speaking to 'Uthman about his brother, al-Walid, when people
have spoken a lot about him?' So I went to 'Uthman when he came out for the
prayer and said, 'I have something I need to say to you. It is good advice
for you.' He said, 'O man, from you!?' (Ma'mar said, "I think that he said,
'I seek refuge with Allah from you!'") So I left and returned to them when
the messenger of 'Uthman came, so I went to him. He said, 'What is your advice?'
I said, 'Allah - glory be to Him! - sent Muhammad, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, with the truth and sent down the Book on him, and you were
one of those who responded to Allah and His Messenger. You made made two
emigrations and you kept the company of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and you saw his guidance. The people are speaking
a lot about the business of al-Walid.' He asked, 'Did you listen directly
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' I said,
'No, but some of his knowledge reached me as it reached the virgin in her
tent.' He said, 'Following on from that, Allah sent Muhammad, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, with the Truth and I was one of those who responded
to Allah and His Messenger and I believed in what he was sent with. I made
the two emigrations as you said. I kept the company of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I gave him allegiance. By Allah,
I did not disobey him nor cheat him until Allah, the Mighty and Exalted,
took him. Then it was the same with Abu Bakr and the same with 'Umar. Then
I succeeded. Do I not have the right as they had it?' I said, 'Yes indeed.'
He said, 'So what are these reports which you convey to me from you lot?
As for what you mentioned about the business of al-Walid, we will punish
for it by what is right, Allah willing.' Then he summoned 'Ali and commanded
him to flog him and he gave him [al-Walid] eighty lashes."
<P>
3494. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "In the time of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, we did not think that anyone was equal
to Abu Bakr and then 'Umar and then 'Uthman, and then we left the Companions
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, without making any
distinction between them."
<P>
'Abdullah corroborated it from 'Abdu'l-'Aziz.
<P>
3495. It is related that 'Uthman ibn Mawhab said, "A man of the people of
Egypt came and made the pilgrimage to the House. He saw some people sitting
and said, 'Who are those people?' They said, 'They are Quryash.' He said,
'Who is the old man among them?' They said, ''Abdullah ibn 'Umar.' He said,
'Ibn 'Umar, I will ask you about something, so inform me. Do you know that
'Uthman fled on the Day of Uhud?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Do you know that
he was absent from Badr and not present at it?' He said, 'Yes.' He said,
'Do you know that he was absent from the Pledge of Ridwan and not present
at it?' He said, 'Yes.' The man said, 'Allah is greater!' Ibn 'Umar said,
'Let me know explain this to you. As for his fleeing from Uhud, I testify
that Allah pardoned him and forgave him. As for being absent from Badr, he
was married to the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace,who was ill and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to him, "You will have the reward and share
of a man who was present at Badr." As for his being absent from the Pledge
of Ridwan, if there had been anyone dearer than 'Uthman in the valley of
Makka, he would have sent him in his place. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sent 'Uthman and the Pledge of Ridwan took
place after Allah had gone to Makka. Therefore the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said of his right hand, "This is the
hand of 'Uthman," and struck it against his other hand and said, "This is
for 'Uthman."' Ibn 'Umar said to him, 'Take this with you now.'"
<P>
3496. It is related from Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, climbed Uhud with Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman, and it shook
with them. He said, 'Be still, Uhud,' and I think he struck it with his foot,
and said, 'There is on you a Prophet, a true one, and two martyrs.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The Story of the Pledge of allegiance (to 'Uthman) and the agreement
on 'Uthman ibn 'Affan </B>
<P>
3497. It is related that 'Amr ibn Ma'mun said, "I saw 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
some days before he was struck down in Madina. He was standing with Hudhayfa
ibn al-Yaman and 'Uthman ibn Hunayf to whom he said, 'What have you done?
Do you fear that you have imposed on the land what it cannot bear?' They
said, 'We have imposed on it something which it can bear. It is not a great
increase.' He said, 'Investigate to see if you have imposed on the land what
it cannot bear.' They said, 'No.' 'Umar said, 'If Allah preserves me, I will
leave the widows of Iraq without need for any man after me ever.'"
<P>
He said, 'Only four days passed until he was struck down."
<P>
He said, "I was standing with only 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas between me and him
on the morning he was killed. He used to pass between the rows and said,
'Make it straight' until he did not see any gaps. Then he would go forward
and say the <I>takbir</I>. He would usually recite <I>Surat Yusuf</I> or
<I>an-Nahl</I> or something like that in the first <I>rak'at </I>so that
the people could gather. He had just said the <I>takbir</I> when I heard
him say, 'The dog has killed me - or eaten me,' when he stabbed him. The
non-Arab unbeliever went around with a double-edged knife, stabbing everyone
he passed on the right and left until he had stabbed thirteen men, of whom
seven died. When one of the Muslim men saw that, he cast his cloak over him.
When the non-Arab unbeliever realised that he had been taken, he killed himself.
'Umar took hold of the hand of 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf and had him lead the
prayer. Those who were near 'Umar saw what I saw and those in the other areas
of the mosque did not know, but they missed 'Umar's voice and were saying,
'Glory be to Allah! Glory be to Allah!' 'Abdu'r-Rahman led them in a quick
prayer. When they finished, he said, 'Ibn 'Abbas! See who has murdered me.'
He looked for a short time and then came &nbsp;back and said, 'Al-Mughira's
slave.' He said, 'The craftsman?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'May Allah fight
him. I treated him correctly. Praise be to Allah who did not make my death
be at the hand of a man who claimed to be Muslim. You and your father used
to want to have many non-Arab unbelievers in Madina.' Al-'Abbas had the greatest
number of slaves. He said, 'If you wish something, we will do it.' He meant:
if you wish, we will kill them.' He said, 'You are mistaken - after they
have spoken your language, prayed towards your <I>qibla</I> and made your
pilgrimage.' Then he was carried to his house and we went with him. It was
as if people had never suffered an affliction before that day. Some said,
'It's all right,' and others said, 'I fear for him.' He was brought a date
infusion and he drank it and it came out of his belly. Then he was brought
some milk and drank it and it came out of his belly, so they knew that he
was dying.
<P>
"We went in to him and people came and began to praise him. A young man came
and said, 'O Amir al-Mu'minin! Take the good news by the good news of Allah
to you for having kept the company of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and your precedence in Islam as you know. Then you
were appointed ruler and you were just and now you have martyrdom.' He said,
'I wish that that could be a counterbalance so that there is nothing for
or against me.' When he turned to go, his wrapper was touching the ground.
He said, 'Bring the boy back to me.' He said, 'Nephew, raise your garment.
It is purer for your garment and shows more fear of your Lord.'
<P>
"He said, 'O 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar! See how great my debts are.' They calculated
it and found that it was about eighty-six thousand. 'Umar said, 'If the property
of 'Umar's family covers the debt, then pay it from their property. Otherwise
ask the Banu 'Adi ibn Ka'b. If their property will not cover it, then ask
Quraysh. Do not go beyond them to anyone else and pay this money for me.
Go to 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin and say, "'Umar sends you the greeting." Do
not say, "Amir al-Mu'minin." Today I am not an amir for the believers. Say,
"'Umar ibn al-Khattab asks for your permission to be buried with his two
companions."' So 'Abdullag gave the greeting and asked for permission to
enter and then entered where she was and found her sitting weeping. He said,
''Umar ibn al-Khattab sends you the greeting and asks for permission to be
buried with his two companions.' She said, 'I had wanted it for myself, but
today I will prefer him over myself.' When he entered, it was said, 'This
is 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar who has come.' He said, 'Make me sit up.' A man supported
him against him and he said, 'What news have you got?' He said, 'That which
you wish, Amir al-Mu'minin. She has given permission.' He said, 'Praise be
to Allah. There was nothing more important to me than that. When I die, then
carry me and then give the greeting and say, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab asks for
permission to enter. If she gives permission, then take me in. If she refuses
me, then take me to the graves of the Muslims.'"
<P>
"The Umm al-Mu'minin Hafsa came and the women came with her. When we saw
her, we got up and she went in to him and wept with him for a time. The men
asked for permission to enter and she went into another place for them and
we heard her weeping inside. They said, 'Command &nbsp;a successor for us,
Amir al-Mu'minin.' He said, 'I do not find anyone more entitled to this authority
than this group - or party - with whom the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was pleased when he died.' He named 'Ali,
'Uthman, az-Zubayr, Talha, Sa'd and 'Abdu'r-Rahman.' He said, ''Abdullah
ibn 'Umar should be present with them, but he has nothing of authority,'
as if it was say a way of consoling him. 'If Sa'd becomes ruler, then it
is that. If not, then whoever of you becomes ruler should seek his help.
I did not dismiss him on account of incompetence or betrayal.'
<P>
"He said, 'I advise the Khalif after me to attend to the first Muhajirun
and acknowledge their due and preserve their honour. I advise him to treat
the Ansar well, those who lived in the Abode and belief before them. Accept
those of them who do good and excuse thoseof them who do evil. I advise him
to treat the people of the various towns well as they are the support of
Islam and the collectors of wealth and the thorn of the enemy. Nothing should
be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I advise
him to treat the desert Arabs well. They are the root of the Arabs and the
material support of Islam. He should take from the middle sort of their property
and distribute it to their poor. I advise him to maintain the <I>dhimma</I>
of Allah Almighty and the <I>dhimma</I> of His Messenger and to fulfil their
contracts for them and fight to defend them and he should not burden them
beyond their capacity.'
<P>
"When he died, we brought him out and set out walking. 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar
gave the greeting and said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab asks permission to enter.'
She said, 'Bring him in,' and he was brought it and placed there with his
two companions. When his burial was finished, that group met and 'Abdu'r-Rahman
said, 'Reduce your business to three of you.' Az-Zubayr said, 'I give my
business to 'Ali.' Talha said, 'I give my business to 'Uthman. Sa'd said,
'I give my business to 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf.' 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, 'Which
of you will free himself of this command and then we will give it to him
to decide which of them he thinks is the better, and Allah and Islam will
be his judge?' The two shaykhs were silent. 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, 'So will
you designate it to me and by Allah, I swear that I will only choose the
better of you?' They said, 'Yes.' He took the hand of one of them and said,
'You have kinship to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and precedence in Islam as you know. I ask you by Allah that if
I give you command, you will be just, and if I give command to 'Uthman, you
will hear and obey.' Then he took the other and said the like of that to
him. When the took the agreement, he said, 'Raise your hand, 'Uthman,' and
he gave him allegiance and 'Ali gave him allegiance and the people of the
abode (i.e. Madina) entered and gave him allegiance."

<B>IX: The virtues of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib al-Qurashi al-Hashimi, Abu'l-Hasan</B>

The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;said to 'Ali,
"You are from me and I am from you." (see 4005)
<P>
'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
died when he was pleased with him." (see 3497)
<P>
3498. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say on the Day of Khaybar, "I will
give the banner tomorrow to a man at whose hands Allah will conquer." They
spent the night wondering who it would be given to, and in the morning the
people went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, all of them hoping to be given it. He said, "Where is 'Ali ibn Abi
Talib?" He was told, "He has something wrong with his eyes, Messenger of
Allah." He said, 'Send for him and bring him to me.' When he came, he spat
in his eyes and made supplication for him and he was healed as if there had
not been anything wrong with him. He gave him the banner. 'Ali said, "O Messenger
of Allah, shall we fight them until they become the same as us?" He said,
"Take it easy until you alight in their quarter and then invite them to Islam
and tell them what is incumbent on them regarding the rights of Allah Almighty.
By Allah, for one man to be guided by you is better for you than having red
camels."
<P>
3499. It is related that Salama said, "Ali stayed behind the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, during Khaybar because he had an
eye-complaint. He said, 'Can I stay behind the Messenger of Allah!' So 'Ali
set out and joined the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
On the evening of the night before the morning when it was conquered, the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I will
give the banner - or the banner will be taken - tomorrow to a man whom Allah
and his Messenger love, or who loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah will
give him victory.' Then 'Ali was with us although we were not expecting him.
They said, 'This is 'Ali!' and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, gave it to him, and Allah gave him victory."
<P>
3500. It is related that Abu Hazim said, "A man came to Sahl ibn Sa'd and
said, 'This is so-and-so ' meaning the governor of the city, 'who is speaking
badly of 'Ali on the minbar.' He said, 'What does he say?' He said, 'He calls
him Abu Turab.' He laughed and said, 'By Allah, it was none but the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who named him that, and there was
no name dearer to him than it!' I asked Sahl to tell me the <I>hadith</I>.
I said, 'O Abu 'Abbas! How was that?' He said, ''Ali went to Fatima and then
went out and slept in the mosque. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Where is your cousin?" She said, "In the mosque." He went
out to him and found that his cloak had fallen from his back and the dust
had reached his back. He began to wipe the dust from his back, saying, "Sit
up, Abu Turab (father of dust)!" twice.'"
<P>
3501. It is related that Sa'd ibn 'Ubada said, "A man came to Ibn 'Umar and
asked him about 'Uthman and he mentioned his good actions. He said, 'Perhaps
that vexes you?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'May Allah spite you!' Then he
asked about 'Ali and he mentioned his good actions and said, 'He is that
and his house is is in the middle of the houses of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.' Then he said, 'Perhaps that vexes you?' He
said, 'Indeed.' He said, 'May Allah spite you! Go and strive your hardest
against me!'"
<P>
3502. It is related from 'Ali, "Fatima, peace be upon her, complained of
what she endured from the mill she used for grinding, and she heard that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had taken
captives. She went to him to ask for a servant and she did not find him.
She found 'A'isha and mentioned it to her. When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came, 'A'isha mentioned to him that Fatima had come.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to us when we
had gone to bed and I went to get up and he said, 'Stay where you are.' He
sat between us until I felt the coolness of his feet on my chest. He said,
'Shall I indicate to you two what is better than what you asked for? When
you go to bed, say "Allah is greater" thirty-four times, "Praise be to Allah"
thirty-three times, and "Glory be to Allah" thirty-three times. That is better
for you than a servant.'"
<P>
3503. It is related that Sa'd said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said to 'Ali, "Are you not content to me in relation
to me as Harun was in relation to Musa?"
<P>
3504. It is related from 'Abida that 'Ali said, "Give judgement as you used
to give judgement. I dislike disagreement. The people should form one community
or I will die as my companions died."
<P>
Ibn Shirin used to think that most of what is related about 'Ali is lies.

The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "You resemble
my physique and my character." (see 4005)
<P>
3505. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "People used to say, 'Abu Hurayra relates
too much.' I used to keep close to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and was content with what would fill my belly. I
did not eat leavened bread nor did I wear stripped fine garments nor did
any man or woman serve me. I used to press my stomach against the gravel
because of hunger. I used to ask a man to recite an <I>ayat</I> to me which
I already knew so that he would take me back and feed me. The best of people
to the poor was Ja'far ibn Abi Talib. He used to take us home and feed us
what was in his house. He would even bring out to is a ghee container which
was empty and we would split it and lick whatever was in it."
<P>
3506. It is related from ash-Sha'bi, "Whenever Ibn 'Umar greeted Ibn Ja'far,
he would say, 'Peace be upon you, O son of the one with two wings!'"

would ask al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib to do the rain prayer. He would
say, 'O Allah, we used to seek intercession with You by Your Prophet and
You gave us rain. We seek intercession with You by the uncle of our Prophet,
so give us rain!'" He added, "And they were given rain."

<B>XII: The Virtues of the relatives of the Messenger of Allah and the virtue
of Fatima, peae be upon her, the daughter of the Prophet</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Fatima is the
mistress of the women of the people of the Garden." (see 3426)
<P>
3508. It is related from 'A'isha that Fatima, peace be upon her, sent to
Abu Bakr as-Siddiq to ask him for her inheritance from the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, in what Allah had given His Messenger, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, of spoils. Abu Bakr said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'We do not bequeath
inheritance. What we leave is <I>sadaqa</I>. However, the family of Muhammad
can eat from this property - i.e. the property of Allah - but they do not
have more than what they eat.' By Allah, I will not alter any of the
<I>sadaqat</I> of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which
was observed in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and I will act in them as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, acted in them." 'Ali said the <I>shahada</I> and
then said, "We have acknowledged your superiority, O Abu Bakr!" and he mentioned
his kinship to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and his right. Abu Bakr spoke and said, 'By the One who has my soul
in His hand, I prefer to do goof to the relatives of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, than to my own relatives."
<P>
3509. It is related that Abu Bakr said, "Respect Muhammad, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, in respect of the members of his family."
<P>
3510. It is related from al-Miswar ibn Makhrama that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Fatima is part of me. Whoever
makes her angry, makes me angry."

Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, confided to me and informed

a will. A man of the Quraysh visited him and said, 'Appoint a successor.'
He said, 'They have said that?' He said, 'Yes.' He asked, 'Who?' He was silent.
Another man visited him - and I think that it was al-Harith - and said, 'Appoint
a successor.' He asked, 'They have said that?' He replied, 'Yes.' He said,
'Who?' He was silent. He said, 'Perhaps they said az-Zubayr?' He said, 'Yes.'
He said, 'By the One in whose hand my soul is, he is the best of them as
far as I know and he was the most beloved of them to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>

is the best of you,' three times."

two or three times. When I returned, I said, 'O my father, I saw you going
and coming.' He said, 'Did you really see me, my son?' I answered, 'Yes.'
He said, 'The Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Who will go to the Banu Qurayza and bring me their news?" so I went.
When I returned, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, mentioned both his parents for me and said, "May my father and mother
be your ransom."'"
<P>

was like sheep or camel droppings with nothing to mix them together. And

to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,
'Your people claim that you do not become angry on account of your daughters.
This 'Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl.' The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and I heard him say after
the <I>tashahhud</I>, "Following on from that, I married my daughter to Abu'l-'As
ibn ar-Rabi' and he spoke to me and told the truth to me. Fatima is part
of me and I dislike that she be vexed. By Allah, the daughter of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the daughter of the
enemy of Allah will not be joined together by the same man.' So 'Ali abandoned
his proposal."
<P>

beloved of the Messenger of Allah?"

<P>
It is related from Harmala, the client of Usama ibn Zayd that while he was
with 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, al-Hajjaj ibn Ayman ibn Umm Ayman entered and did
not complete his bowing and prostration. He said, "Repeat it." When he turned
away, Ibn 'Umar asked me, "Who is this?" I replied, "Al-Hajjaj ibn Ayman
ibn Umm Ayman." Ibn 'Umar said, "If the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, had seen this one, he would have loved him." Then

and grant him peace. I was young, unmarried boy and I used to sleep in the
mosque in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
I saw in a dream that the two angels took me and took me to the Fire and
it was circular like a well and it had two sides like those of the well.
There were some people in it whom I recognised and I began to say, 'I seek
refuge with Allah from the Fire. I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire.'
Then another angel met the two and said to me, 'Do not be alarmed.' I related
it to Hafsa who related it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. He said, 'What an excellent man 'Abdullah would be if only he
prayed at night.'" Salim said, "'Abdullah used to only pray a little at night."

to bless me with a righeous companion, and He has blessed me with you.' He
said, 'Where are you from?' I said, 'From the people of Kufa.' He said, 'Is

water among you? Is there not among you the one whom Allah protected from
Shaytan, i.e. on the tongue of His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace? [i.e. 'Ammar] Is there not among you the confidant of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with his secrets whom no one but
he knows? [i.e. Hudhayfa]' Then he said, 'How does 'Abdullah recite, <I>"By
the night as it conceals.." </I>(92:1)' So I recited to him, <I>'By the night
when it conceals and the day when it reveals and the male and female </I>[i.e.

whom no one but he knows, i.e. Hudhayfa?' I replied, 'Yes indeed.' He said,

you the keeper of the siwak and secrets?' (i.e. Ibn Mas'ud) I said, 'Yes
indeed.' He said, 'How does 'Abdullah recite, "<I>By the night when it conceals
and the day when it reveals</I>." (92:1)' I said, <I>"And&nbsp;the male and

to him wherever he is, or wherever his turn is.'" She said, "Umm Salama mentioned
that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and she said,
'He turned away from me. When he returned to me, I mentioned that to him
and he turned away from me. When I mentioned it to him the third time, he

and said, 'What is this that has reached me about you?' They used not to
lie and said, 'It is what has reached you.' He said, 'Are you not pleased
that while people return with booty to their homes, you return to your homes
with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace? If
the Ansar were to travel through a valley or a ravine, I would travel the
valley or ravine of the Ansar.'"

'I am the wealthiest man of the Ansar so I will allot you half of my property.
I have two wives, so see which of my two wives you like and name her and
I will divorce her. When she finishes her <I>'idda</I>, then you can marry
her.' He answered, 'May Allah bless you in your family and your wealth. Where
is your market?' So they directed him to the Banu Qaynuqa' market. When he
returned he had a profit in dried yoghurt and ghee. Then he continued to
go in the morning. then one day he came with traces of yellow scent on him.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'What is it?'

said, 'You know that I am the wealthiest man of the Ansar, so I will split
my property in half between you and me. I have two wives, so see which of
my two wives you like and I will divorce her. When she has become lawful,
then you can marry her.' 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, 'May Allah bless you in your
family!' He did not return that day unless he had a profit in some ghee and
dried youghurt. It was not long before he came to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with traces of yellow scent on him.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'What is it?'
He said, 'I have married a woman of the Ansar.' He said, 'How much did you

the guest of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' She said,

you entered the mosque, they said, "This is a man who is one of the people
of the Garden."' He said, 'By Allah, no one should say what he does not know!
I will relate to you why that is so. I had a dream in the time of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I recounted it to him. I dreamt
that I was in a meadow,' and he mentioned its vast expanse and greeness.
'In the middle of it was a iron pillar whose bottom was in the earth and
whose top was in the heaven and at the top of it was a round handle. I was
told, "Climb it." I said, "I cannot!" Then a servant came and lifted up my
garment from behind and I climbed until I reached the top of it and took
hold of the handle. I was told, "Hold fast!" I woke up and it was in my hand.
I recounted it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and

handle is the 'firmest handle'. You will remain in Islam until you die."'

and grant him peace, entered]?' He then said, 'You are in a land where usury
is widespread. If a man owes you something and gives you a load of straw
or a load of barley or a load of fodder, do not take it from him. It is usury.'"

family I wished to see exalted more than your family.' He said, 'As well,
by the One who has my soul in His hand.' She said, 'Messenger of Allah, Abu
Sufyan is a grasping man. Is there anything against me if I feed my children
from what he has.' He said, "I only think that is allowable if it is a reasonable
amount.'"

<B>LIV: The <I>Hadith</I> of Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn Nufayl</B>
<P>
3514. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, met Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn Nufayl at the bottom
of Baldah before any revelation had come down on the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. Some food was offered to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and he refused to eat of it. Then Zayd said,
"I do not eat from what you slaughter to your idols. I only eat from that
over which the name of Allah has been mentioned." Zayd ibn 'Amr used to criticise
Quraysh for how they slaughtered. He said, "Allah created the sheep and sent
down water from the sky for it, and made things grow from the earth for it
and then you slaughter it in other than the name of Allah," finding that
objectionable and out of respect for Him.
<P>
3515.It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that Zayd ibn 'Amr went to Syria
to ask about religion and to follow it. He met a Jewish scholar and asked
him about his religion and said, "I may take on your religion, so inform
me." He said, "You will not have our religion unless you take your portion
of Allah's wrath." Zayd said, "I am only fleeing from the wrath of Allah!
I will not ever bear any of Allah's wrath at all if I can avoid it. Can you
direct to me to another religion?" He said, "I do not know any except that
one be a <I>hanif</I>." Zayd said, "What is a <I>hanif</I>?" He said, "The
<I>deen</I> of Ibrahim. He was neither a Jew nor a Christian and he worshipped
only Allah." Zayd left and met a Christian scholar and mentioned the like
of it. He said, "You will not have our religion unless you take your portion
of Allah's curse." He said, "I am only fleeing from the curse of Allah! I
will not ever bear any of Allah's curse or wrath at all if I can avoid it.
Can you direct to me to another religion?" He said, "I do not know any except
that one be a <I>hanif</I>." Zayd said, "What is the a?" He said, "The
<I>deen</I> of Ibrahim. He was neither a Jew nor a Christian and he worshipped
only Allah." When Zayd saw what they said about Ibrahim, peace be upon him,
he left. When he came out of there, he raised his hands and said, "O Prophet,
I testify that I have the <I>deen</I> of Ibrahim!"
<P>
3616. It is related that Asma' bint Abi Bakr said, "I saw Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn
Nufayl standing, leaning with his back against the Ka'ba, saying, 'O company
of Quraysh! By Allah, none of you but me is following the <I>deen</I> of
Ibrahim!' He used to save the lives of girls about to buried alive. He would
say to the man when he wanted to kill his daughter, 'Do not kill her. I will
spare you feeding her.' He would take her and when he was grown up, he would
say to her father, 'If you like, I will return her to you, and if you like,
I will spare you having to feed her.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LV: The Building of the Ka'ba</B>
<P>
3617. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "When the Ka'ba was being
rebuilt, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went with
'Abbas to move stones. 'Abbas said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, 'Put your waist-wrapper round your neck to protect yourself
from the stones.' He fell to the earth with his eyes staring up into the
sky and said, 'My waist-wrapper! My waist-wrapper!' and he girded himself
with it."
<P>
3618. It is related that 'Amr ibn Dinar and 'Ubaydullah ibn Abi Yazid said,
"There was not a wall around the House in the time of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. They used to pray around the House until 'Umar
built a wall around it." 'Ubaydullah said, "Its wall was low, so Ibn az-Zubayr
built it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LVI: The Days of the <I>Jahiliyya</I> Period before Islam</B>
<P>
3619. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Quraysh used to fast the day of 'Ashura'
in the time of the Jahiliyya. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, used also to fast it. When he came to Madina, he fasted it and
commanded that it be fasted. When Ramadan became obligatory, whoever wished
could fast it ('Ashura') and whoever wished could leave it."
<P>
3620. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "They used to think that <I>'umra
</I>during the months of hajj was one of the most heinous actions anyone
could do. They would call al-Muharram Safar and would say, 'When the wounds
on the back of the camel heal and the scar has gone, then<I> 'umra</I> is
lawful for anyone who wants to perform it.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and his Companions arrived on the morning of the
fourth of Dhu'l-Hijja, having gone into <I>ihram</I> for the <I>hajj</I>,
and he told them to make it an<I> 'umra</I>. They thought that extraordinary
and said, 'Messenger of Allah, what sort of coming out of <I>ihram</I> is
it?' He said, 'A total coming out of <I>ihram</I>.'"
<P>
3621. It is related that the grandfather of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "A
flood occurred in the <I>Jahiliyya</I> and covered what is between the two
mountains."
<P>
Sufyan said, "This hadith has some significance."
<P>
3622. It is related that Qays ibn Abi Hazim said, "Abu Bakr visited a woman
of Ahmas called Zaynab and saw that she would not speak. He asked, 'Why does
she not speak?' They said, 'She is performing a silent hajj.' He said to
her, 'Speak. This is not lawful. This is one of the practices of the
<I>Jahiliyya</I>.' So she started speaking.' She asked, 'Who are you?' He
replied, 'A man of the Muhajirun.' She said, 'Which Muhajirun?' He answered,
'Of Quraysh.' She asked, 'From what part of Quraysh are you?' He said, 'You
ask a lot of questions. I am Abu Bakr.' She said, 'How long will this righeous
business which Allah has brought after the <I>Jahiliyya</I> last for us?'
He said, 'It will last for you as long as your Imams are straight with you.'
She asked, 'What are the Imams?' He said, 'Do not your people have leaders
and nobles who command and are obeyed?' She said, 'Yes.' He said, 'They are
those who are in charge of people.'"
<P>
3623. It is related that 'A'isha said, "There was a black slavegirl who belonged
to some of the Arabs who became Muslim. She had a small hut in the mosque."
She said, "She used to come to me and talk with me. When she finished talking,
she would say:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'The day of the scarf was one of the marvels of our Lord
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes indeed! He surely rescued me from the land of unbelief.'"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
When this happened often, 'A'isha asked her, "What is the day of the scarf?"
She said, "A girl of one of my masters once went out wearing a leather scarf
and it fell off her. A kite flew down on it thinking it was meat and took
it. They suspected me and tortured me until it reached the point where they
even searched my private parts. While they were around me and I was in distress,
the kite flew over their heads and dropped it. They took it and I said to
them, 'This is what you suspected me of and I am innocent of it.'"
<P>
3624. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Whoever takes an oath, should only swear by Allah."
Quraysh used to swear by their fathers and he said, "Do not swear by your
fathers."
<P>
3625. It is related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Qasim that al-Qasim used to
walk in front of the funeral procession and would not stand up for it. He
reported that 'A'isha said, "The people of the <I>Jahiliyya</I> used to rise
for it and when they saw it, they would say, 'You were noble in your family.
What are you now?' twice."
<P>
3626. It is related that 'Umar said, "The idolaters used to not leave Muzadalifa
until the sun had risen on Thabir. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, differed from them by leaving before the sun rose."
<P>
3627. It is related from 'Ikrima that <I>"ka'san dih&acirc;qan"</I> (78:34)
means successive filled glassses. Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard my father say
in the <I>Jahiliyya</I>, 'Provide us with <I>ka'san dih&acirc;qan</I>.'"
<P>
3628. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The most truthful phrase ever said by a poet
is the words of Labid:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'Everything except Allah is false.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
"And Umayya ibn Abi's-Salt was close to becoming a Muslim." [r490+15]
<P>
3629. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Abu Bakr as-Siddiq had a slave who
used to pay him a levy and Abu Bakr used to eat from the levy. One day he
brought something and Abu Bakr ate some of it. The slave said to him, 'Do
you know what this is?' He said, 'What is it?' He said, 'In the
<I>Jahiliyya</I> I used to be a soothsayer for a man. I did not do soothsaying
well. I only deceived him. He met me and gave me that from which you ate.'
So Abu Bakr inserted his hand into his mouth and vomited all that he had
in his stomach."
<P>
3630. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said in the people of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>
used to sell the meat of camels based on the <I>habal al-habala</I>. He said
that <I>habal al-habala</I> was a kind of sale in which a she-camel was sold
before it has been would its mother had been born. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade that.
<P>
3631. It is related that Ghaylan ibn Jarir said, "We used to go to Anas ibn
Malik and he would relate to us about the Ansar and he would say to us, 'Your
people did such-and-such on such-and-such a day, and your people did
such-and-such on such-and-such a day."
<P>
<P>
<B>(Qasama (oaths regarding murder) in the Jahiliyya)</B>
<P>
3632. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The first <I>qasama</I> which
took place in the <I>Jahiliyya</I> was done among us, the Banu Hashim. A
man of the Banu Hashim was hired by a man of Quraysh from another branch.
He went with him with his camels. A man of the Banu Hashim passed by him
and the handle of his bag had broken. He said, "Help me by giving me a
hobble-rope with which to tie the handle of my bag so that the camels do
not bolt. He gave him a hobble-rope and he used it to tie the handle of his
baf. When they halted, the camels were hobbled except for one camel. The
one who had hired him said, 'Why is this camel among the camels not hobbled?'
He said, 'It does not have a hobble-rope.' He said, 'So where it is
hobble-rope?'" He said, "He threw a stick at him that caused his death. A
man from the people of the Yemen passed by him and he said, 'Will you attend
the festival (of hajj)?' He said, 'I am not going to attend, but it is just
possible that I will attend.' He said, 'Will you convey a message from you
for one time in your life?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'When you go to attend
the festival then call out, "O family of Quraysh!" When they answer you,
then call, "O Banu Hashim!" When they answer you, ask for Abu Talib and tell
him that so-and-so has killed me for a hobble-rope.' Then the man who had
been hired died. When the one who had hired him arrived, Abu Talib went to
him and said, 'What has happened to our companion?' He said, 'He became ill
and I looked after him well and then buried him.' He said, 'He deserved that
from you.' After some time, the man whom he had charged with conveying his
message from him arrived during the festival.. He said, "O family of Quraysh!'
They said, 'This is Quraysh.' He said, 'O Banu Hashim!' They said, 'This
is Banu Hashim.' He said, 'Where is Abu Talib?' They said, 'This is Abu Talib.'
He said, 'So-and-so told me to convey a message to you: that so-and-so killed
him for a hobble-rope.' Abu Talib went to him and said to him, 'You can choose
from one of three options. If you wish, you can pay a hundred camels because
you killed our companion. If you wish, fifty of your people can swear that
you did not kill him. If you refuse, then we will kill you for him.' He went
to his people and they said, 'We will swear.' A woman of the Banu Hashim
who was married to one of their men and had had a son by him, went to him
and said, 'Abu Talib! I wish that my son among these fifty be excused from
the oath and that he should not be forced to take the oath when the oaths
are taken.' He did that. One of their men came to him and said, 'Abu Talib!
You want fifty men to take an oath in place of a hundred camels, so each
man is equivalent to two camels. There are two camels. Accept them from me
and do not force me to take the oath when the oaths are taken.' He accepted
them. So forty-eight men came and took the oath.' Ibn 'Abbas said, "By the
One in whose hand my soul is, not a year had passed with any of the forty-eight
still alive.'"
<P>
3633. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Day of Bu'ath was a day which
Allah brought about for His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought
it about when their community had been split and their leaders killed and
wounded. Allah advanced it for His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, so that they would enter into Islam."
<P>
3634. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Running in the bottom of the valley
between Safa and Marwa was not a <I>sunna</I>, but the people of the
<I>Jahiliyya</I> used to run it and would say, 'We would cross the river
bed running hard.'"
<P>
3635. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "O people! Listen to what I say
to you and let me hear what you say. Do not leave simply saying, 'Ibn 'Abbas
said this and Ibn 'Abbas said that.' Whoever does <I>tawaf</I> of the House
should go behind al-Hijr and you should not say, 'Al-Hat&icirc;m [lit. smashed]'
In the <I>Jahiliyya</I> a man used to take an oath and then throw his whip,
shoe or bow into it."
<P>
3636. It is related that 'Amr ibn Maymun said, "In the <I>Jahiliyya</I> I
saw a female monkey around which other monkeys had gathered. It had fornicated
and they stoned it and I stoned it with them."
<P>
3637. It is related that 'Ubaydullah said, "I heard Ibn 'Abbas say, 'Some
of the traits of the <I>Jahiliyya</I> are: attacking people's lineage, wailing,'"
and he forgot the third. Sufyan said, "They say that it is thinking that
rain is caused by the stars."

<P>
<B>LVII: The sending of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace</B>
<P>
He is Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib ibn Hashim ibn 'Abdu Manaf
ibn Qusayy ibn Kilab ibn Murra ibn Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy ibn Ghalib ibn Fihr ibn
Malik ibn an-Nadr ibn Kinana ibn Khuzayma ibn Mudrika ibn Ilyas ibn Mudar
ibn Nizar ibn Ma'add ibn 'Adnan.
<P>
3638. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, received revelation when he was forty, and he remained
in Makka for thirteen years and then was commanded to emigrate to Madina,
and remained there for ten years and then he, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, died."
<P>
<P>
<B>LVIII: What the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
his Companions experienced from the idolaters in Makka</B>
<P>
3639. It is related that Khabbab said, "I went to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was using his cloak as
a pillow in the shade of the Ka'ba, and we had encountered persecution from
the idoaters. I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, why do you not make supplication
for us?' He sat up and his face had become red and said, 'Among those before
you there was a man who was raked with metal teeth leaving no flesh or sinews
on his bones, but that did not turn him from his <I>deen</I>. A saw was planed
on the top of his head and he was sawed in half, but that did not turn him
from his deen. Allah will complete this business so that a rider will be
able to travel from San'a' to Hadramawt fearing none but Allah,' and he added
for clarification, 'and wolves against his sheep.'"
<P>
3640. It is related from 'Abdullah, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, recited <I>Surat an-Najm</I> and did <I>sajda</I> in it
and all of the people did <I>sajda</I>, but one man there whom I saw take
a handful of pebbles or earth and brought it up to his face and said, 'This
is enough for me.' I later saw him killed as an unbeliever."
<P>
3641. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "While the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in prostration, surrounded by some
of the idolaters of Quraysh, 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt brought the stomach membrane
of a young camel and threw it on the back of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. He did not raise his head until Fatima came and
removed it from his back. Then he pronounced an invocation against those
who had done that. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'O Allah! Destroy the council of Quraysh! Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, 'Utba
ibn Rabi'a, Shayba ibn Rabi'a, 'Umayya ibn Khalaf! (or Ubayy ibn Khalaf.
Shu'ba is unsure.)' I saw them killed on the day of Badr and they were thrown
into the well, except for Umayya or Ubayy. His joints separated, so he not
was thrown into the well."
<P>
3642. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abza
ordered me, 'Ask Ibn 'Abbas about these two <I>ayats</I>:<I> "Who do not
kill anyone Allah has forbidden &#150; except with a legal right</I>" (25:68)
and <I>"As for anyone who kills a believer deliberately." </I>(4:93)' So
I asked Ibn 'Abbas and he said, 'When the verse in <I>al-Furqan</I> (25:68)
was sent down, the idolaters of the people of Makka said, "We have killed
the life which Allah has made sacred, and we have called on other gods with
Allah and we have committed lewd actions." So Allah sent down, <I>"except
for those who repent and believe ..." </I>(25:70) So this verse is for those
people. As for the verse in <I>an-Nisa' </I>(4:93), when a man knows Islam
and its Shari'a and then murders, his repayment is Hellfire.' I mentioned
it to Mujahid who said, 'except for those who regret.'"
<P>
3643. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said, "I asked 'Abdullah ibn
'Amr, "Tell me about the worst thing that the idolaters did to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said, 'While the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was praying in the Hijr of the Ka'ba,
'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt came an put his cloak around his neck and began to choke
him with it severely. Abu Bakr came and grabbed his shoulders and pulled
him away from him saying, '"Will you kill a man for saying, 'My Lord is
Allah'?"'"
<P>
Abu Ishaq corroborated it from 'Urwa, "I said to 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr."
<P>
It is related from Hisham's father, "It was said to 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr."
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Amr related it.
<P>
<P>
<B>LIX: Abu Bakr as-Siddiq becomes Muslim</B>
<P>
3644. It is related that 'Ammar ibn Yasir said, "I saw the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when there were only with him five
slaves, two men, and Abu Bakr."
<P>
<P>
<B>LX: Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas becoming Muslim</B>
<P>
3645. It is related that Abu Ishaq Sa'd ibn Waqqas said, "No one became Muslim
until the day I became Muslim, and I remained for seven days and a third
of Islam."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXI: Concerning the jinn</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Say: it has been revealed to me that a company
of jinns listened." </I>(72:1)
<P>
3646. It is related that Ma'n ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman said, "I heard my father
say, 'I asked Masruq, "Who informed the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, about the jinn on the night they listened to the Qur'an?"
He said, "My father (i.e. 'Abdullah) informed me that a tree informed him."'"
<P>
3647. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that he used to carry a pot for
his <I>wudu' </I>and for the lavatory. While he was following him, he said,
"Who is it?" He said, "I am Abu Hurayra." He said, "Go and look for some
stones with which I can cleanse myself. Do not bring me bones or dung." "I
brought him some stones which I carried in the corner of my garment and placed
them beside him and then left. When he finished, I walked and said, 'What
is the matter with bones and dung?' He said, 'There are the food of the jinn.
A delegation of the jinn of Nasibin came to me, and they were excellent jinn!
They asked me for provision and I prayed to Allah for them that they would
not pass by a bone or dung without finding food on it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXII: Abu Dharr al-Ghifari becoming Muslim</B>
<P>
3648. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When Abu Dharr heard that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had been sent, he said
to his brother, "Go this valley and bring me some information about this
man who claims that he is a Prophet to whom reports come from heaven. Listen
to what he says and then come to me.' So his brother went until he reached
him and listened to what he said and then returned to Abu Dharr. He said
to him, 'I saw him commanding good character and words which are not poetry.'
He said, 'You have not satisfied what I wanted.' So he got provisions and
took a bag with some water in it and went out to Makka. He went to the mosque
and looked for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, although
he did not know him, but he disliked to ask anyone about him. When part of
the night had gone, 'Ali saw him and recognised that he was a stranger. When
he saw him, he follows him and neither of them asked his companion about
anything until morning. Then he took his bag and provision to the mosque
and the day remained like that, without him seeing the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, until evening. He returned to his resting-place
and 'Ali passed by him and said, 'Has not the man recognised his house yet?'
So he woke up him and took him with him and neither of them asked his companion
about anything until it was the third day. 'Ali did the same and Abu Dharr
stayed with him. Then he said, 'Will you not tell me what has brought you?'
He said, 'If you give me a pledge and promise to guide me, I will do that.'
So he did that and he told him. He said, 'It is true. He is the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. In the morning, follow
me. If I see something which causes me to fear for you, I will stop as if
I am going to pass water. If I go on, follow me and enter where I enter.'
He did it and followed after him until he went in to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and he entered with him. He listened to what
he said and became Muslim immediately. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to him, 'Return to your people and inform them until
my command comes to you.' He said, 'By the One who has my soul in His hand,
I will shout it out in the midst of them!' So he went out until he came to
the mosque where Quraysh were and called out in at the top of his voice,
'I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is
the Messenger of Allah!' Then the people got up and beat him until they threw
him to the ground. Al-'Abbas came and put himself over him and said, 'Woe
to you! Do you not know that he is from Ghifar and your trade rout to Syria
goes through them?' So he saved him from them. Then he did the same thing
the next day and they beat him and attacked him, and al-'Abbas put himself
over him."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIII: Sa'id ibn Zayd becomes Muslim</B>
<P>
3649. It is related that Qays said, "I heard Sa'id ibn Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn
Nufayl saying in the mosque of Kufa, 'By Allah, I saw myself constricted
by 'Umar to leave Islam before 'Umar became Muslim. If Uhud could move on
account of what you have done to 'Uthman, it would have done so."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIV: 'Umar ibn al-Khattab becomes Muslim</B>
<P>
3650. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "We have become mighty
since 'Umar became Muslim."
<P>
3651. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "While 'Umar was in fear
in his house, al-'As ibn Wa'il as-Sahmi, Abu 'Amr, came wearing a stripped
embroidered cloak and shirt with a silk border. He was from the Banu Sahm,
and they were our allies in the <I>Jahiliyya</I>. He said to him, 'What is
wrong with you?' He said, 'Your people claim that they will kill me if I
become Muslim.' He said, 'They will have no way to get you after that is
said. I have given protection.' Al-'As went out and met the people who were
filling the valley. He said, 'Where are you going?' They said, 'We want 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab who has become a heretic!' He said, 'There is no way to him,'
so the people retreated."
<P>
3652. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "When 'Umar became Muslim,
the people gathered at his house and said, ''Umar has become a heretic.'
I was a boy on the roof of my house. A man came wearing a silken cloak and
said, "'Umar has become a heretic. So what? I am his protector.'" He said,
"I saw the people separating from him, asking, 'Who is this?' They said,
'Al-'As ibn Wa'il.'"
<P>
3653. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I never heard 'Umar say
about anything, 'I think it is like such-and-such,' without the thing being
as he had thought it was. While 'Umar was sitting, a handsome man passed
by him and obsreved said, 'Unless I am mistaken, this one still has the
<I>deen</I> of the <I>Jahiliyya</I> or he was their soothsayer.' Bring the
man here. He was summoned and he said that to him, and he said, 'I have never
seen a like day when a Muslim man was confronted with that!' He insisted,
'I am resolved that you will tell me.' He said, 'I was their soothsayer in
the <I>Jahiliyya</I>.' 'Umar asked, 'What was the most extraordinary thing
that your jinn brought you?' He said, 'One day while I was in the market,
she came to me and I recognised alarm in her. She said, "Have you not see
the jinn in bewilderment and despair after they have been overturned? Now
they follow the she-camels with their saddle-cloths."' 'Umar said, 'He spoke
the truth. One day while I was near their gods, a man brought a calf to
sacrifice. Then something shouted, and I have never heard a shouter with
a harsher voice than it. It said, "O audacious one! A matter of success -
a man of eloquence who says, 'There is no god but You!'" The people fled,
but I said, "I will not go until I know who is behind this." So it called,
"O audacious one! A matter of success - a man of eloquent who says, 'There
is no god but You!'" I left and it was not long before it was said, "This
is a Prophet."'"
<P>
[The man was Sawad ibn Qarib]

in the mosque of Kufa, 'By Allah, I recall myself and his sister constricted

"I saw the abode of your emigration, with palm-trees between two lava-beds."
Some people emigrated in the direction of Madina and all those who had emigrated
to Abyssinian returned to Madina. (see 3663, 3990)
<P>
3659. It is related that 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Adi ibn al-Khiyar reported, "Al-Miswar
ibn Makhrama and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Aswad ibn 'Abdu Yaghuth said, 'What
prevents you from speaking to 'Uthman about his brother, al-Walid when people
have spoken a lot about what he has done?' 'Ubaydullah said, 'I therefore
went to 'Uthman when he came out for the prayer and said, 'I have something
I need to say to you. It is good advice for you.' He said, 'O man, I seek
refuge with Allah from you!' So I left and when I finished the prayer, I
sat beside al-Miswar and Ibn 'Abdu Yaghuth and I told what I said to 'Uthman
and what he had said to me. They said, 'You have done what you must.' While
I was sitting between them, when the messenger of 'Uthman came. They said
to me, 'Allah has put you to the test.' I went until I entered where he was
and he said, ''What is your advice which you mentioned earlier?'" He said,
'I said the <I>shahada</I> and then said, 'Allah sent Muhammad, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, with the truth and sent down the Book on him,
and you were one of those who responded to Allah and His Messenger. You made
made two emigrations and you kept the company of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and you saw his guidance. The people
are speaking a lot about the business of al-Walid ibn 'Uqba, and you must
impose the <I>hadd</I> on him.' He said to me, 'O nephew, did you listen
directly the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?'
I said, 'No, but some of his knowledge reached me as it reached the virgin
in her tent.' "'Uthman said the <I>shahada</I> and then said, 'Allah sent
Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with the Truth and I was
one of those who responded to Allah and His Messenger and I believed in what
Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was sent with. I made
the first two emigrations as you said. I kept the company of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I gave him allegiance.
By Allah, I did not disobey him nor cheat him until Allah took him. Then
Allah made Abu Bakr khalif, and by Allah, I did not disobey him nor cheat
him. Then 'Umar became khalif, and by Allah, I did not disobey him nor cheat
him.. Then I succeeded. Do I not have the same rights over you as they had
over me?' He said, 'Yes, indeed.' He said, 'So what are these reports which
you convey to me from you lot? As for what you mentioned about the business
of al-Walid ibn 'Uqba, we will punish for it by what is right, Allah willing.'"
<P>
He said, "He had al-Walid flogged with a hundred lashes and ordered 'Ali
to flog him, and it was he who flogged him,"
<P>
It is related from az-Zuhri, "Do I not have the same right over you as they
had?"
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said,<I> "A trial from your Lord,"</I> (2:49; 7:141) is that
with which you are tested in the way of hardship and in a situation. <I>Bala'
</I>means <I>ibtila' </I>(test) and <I>tamh&icirc;s</I> (examination). It
comes from testing it and examining it, i.e. to extract what is in it, so
to "try" to to gain information from. <I>"He will test you" </I>(2:249) is
to examine you. <I>"A terrible trial" </I>is blessing, and it is from testing
the thing, and that is part of His test.
<P>
3660. It is related from 'A'isha that Umm Habiba and Umm Salama mentioned
a church they had seen in Abyssinia in which there were pictures. They mentioned
it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said,
"Among those people, if a virtuous man dies, they build a place of worship
over his grave and paint those pictures in it. Those people are the worst
of creatures in the sight of Allah on the Day of Rising."
<P>
3661. It is related that Umm Khalid bint Khalid ibn Sa'd said, "I came from
the land of Abyssinia when I was a young girl. The Messenger of Allah, may

said that it means "good" in Abyssinian.)"
<P>

Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he was praying and he would reply
to us. But when we returned from the Negus we greeted him and he did not
reply to us. We said, 'O Messenger of Allah, we used to greet you and you
would reply to us!.' He said, 'In the prayer is occupation enough.'"
<P>
I (a sub-narrator) said, "What do you do?" He said, "I answer him myself."
<P>
3663. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The fact that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had departed reached us while we were in the
Yemen. We embarked on a boat and our boat took us to the Negus in Abyssinia.
We found Ja'far ibn Abi Talib. So we stayed with him until we all went and
found the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he had conquered
Khaybar. He said, 'People of the boat! You have two emigrations!'"

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "How have you helped your uncle
who used to protect you and become angry on your behalf?" He said, "He is
in the swallowest part of the Fire. If it had not been for me, he would have
been in the lowest rank of the Fire."
<P>
3671. It is related from the father of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, "When Abu Talib
was near death, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, came to him and found Abu Jahl with him. He said, 'Uncle, say, "There
is no god but Allah", and I will testify before Allah that you said it.'
Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya said, 'Abu Talib! Will you turn from
the religion of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib?' They kept on cautioning him against it
until the last thing that Abu Talib said was that he was of the religion
of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'I will continue to ask for forgiveness for you as long as I am not
forbidden to do it for you.' Then it was sent down<I>, 'It is not right for
the Prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for the idolaters, even
if they are close relatives, after it has become clear to them that they
are the Companions of the Blazing Fire.</I>' (9:113) Also revealed was: <I>'You
cannot guide those you love,'</I> (28:56)"
<P>
3672. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that when the Prophet's uncle
was mentioned in his presence, he heard him say, "Perhaps my intercession
will help him and he will be put in the swallowest part of the Fire which
will reach his ankles and from which his blood will boil."
<P>
This is related from Yazid and he said, "from it his brain itself will boil."

asked al-Jarud who was beside me, "What does he mean?" He replied, "From
his throat to his lower abodmen." "My heart was brought out and then a golden
tray filled with belief was brought and my heart was washed and filled and
then returned. I was brought a white animal, smaller than a mule and larger
than a donkey." Al-Jarud said, "Is it al-Buraq, Abu Hamza?" Anas said, "Yes."
<P>
"Its step was far as its sight reached. I was carried on it and Jibril took
me to the lowest heaven and asked for it to be opened. It was asked, 'Who
is this?' He replied, 'Jibril.' It was asked, 'Who is with you?' He said,
'Muhammad.' It was said, 'Has he been sent for?' He answered, 'Yes.' It was

he returned the greeting and then said, 'Welcome to a righteous brother and
a righteous Prophet!' When I passed on, he wept. He was asked, 'Why are you
weeping?' He replied, 'I am weeping because more of the community of this
lad who was sent after me will enter the Garden than those of my community!'

<P>
"Then I was shown the Lote-tree of the Limit.Its fruits were like the pots
of Hajar, and its leaves were like elephant ears. He said, 'This is the Lote-tree
of the Limit.' There were four rivers: two hidden rivers and two apparent
rivers. I asked, 'What are these two, Jibril?' and he said, 'The two hidden
ones are in the Garden, and the two apparent ones are the Nile and Euphrates.'
Then the Inhabited House was shown to me. Every day seventy thousand angels
enter it. Then I was brought a vessel of wine, a vessel of milk and a vessel
of honey. I took the milk and he said, 'It is the natural form (<I>fitra</I>)
which you and your community have.'
<P>
Then fifty prayers every day were made obligatory for me. I returned and
passed by Musa who asked, 'What are you commanded?' I replied, 'I am commanded
fifty prayers a day.' He said, 'Your community will not be able to do fifty
prayers a day. I tested people before you. I tried as hard as I could with
the tribe of Israel. So back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce it for your
community.' I went back and He lessened it by ten for me. Then I returned
to Musa and he said the same thing. I went back and He lessened it by ten
for me. Then I returned to Musa and he said the same thing. I went back and
He lessened it by ten for me. Then I went to Musa and he said the like of
it. Then I went back and was commanded ten prayers every day. I went back
and he said the like of it. Then I went back and was commanded five prayers
every day. I went back to Musa and he said, 'What have you been commanded?'
I said, "I have been commanded five prayers every day.' He said, 'Your community
will not able to do five prayers every day. I tested people before you. I
tried as hard as I could with the tribe of Israel. So back to your Lord and
ask Him to reduce it for your community.' I said, 'I have asked my Lord until
I am embarrassed, but I am content and have submitted.' When I passed, there
was a call, 'I have imposed My obligation and have lightened it for My slaves.'"
<P>

he went blind, said, "I heard Ka'b ibn Malik relate about when he stayed
behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the Tabuk
expedition (in full)." Ibn Bukayr said in his hadith, "I was present with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the night of 'Aqaba
<I>when</I> we gave our pledge on Islam. I would not want to exchange it
for being, even if Badr is more renowned among the people than it."
<P>
3677. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I was present with my
two maternal uncles at 'Aqaba." Abu 'Abdullah said that Ibn 'Uyayna said

were among those at 'Aqaba."
<P>
3679. It is related from Abu Idris 'A'idhullah that 'Ubada ibn as-Samit,
who was one of those present at Badr with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and one of his Companions on the night of
'Aqaba informed him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said about a group of his Companions were around him, "Give
homage to me based on not associating anything with Allah, not stealing,
not committing adultery, not killing your children, not making a false accusation
of adultery which you forge yourselves and not being disobedient regarding
anything good. Any among you who fulfil this will be rewarded by Allah. Any
who fall short regarding any of these things and are punished in this world,
that will be an expiation for them. If someone falls short regarding any
of these things and Allah conceals it, then it will be up to Allah. If He
wishes, He will pardon him, and if He wishes, He will punish him." 'Ubada
said, "We gave him our allegiance on those conditions."
<P>
3680. It is related that 'Ubada ibn as-Samit said, "I was among the leaders
who gave homage to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace,." He said, "We gave homage based on not associating anything with
Allah nor stealing nor committing fornication nor killing the self which
Allah has made inviolable except for a right, nor robbing nor disobey in
exchange for the Garden if we did that. If we broke any of that, the judgement
of that would be up to Allah."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIII: The Prophet marrying 'A'isha and her coming to Madina and consummating
the marriage with her</B>
<P>

and grant him peace, married me when I was a girl of six years. We came to
Madina and stayed with the Banu'l-Harith ibn Khazraj. I came down with a
fever and my hair fell out and then grew back abundantly. Umm Ruman came
when I was on a see-saw with some of my friends. She called me and I went
to her, not knowing what she wanted me for. She took me by the hand until
she made me stand at the door of the house, as I was panting, until my breathing
was calm. Then she took some water and wiped my face and head with it. Then
she brought me into the house and there were some women of the Ansar in the
room who said, 'The best and the blessing and good luck.' She handed be over
to them and they prepared me. Then I was surprised by the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, coming to me in the mid-morning
and she handed me over to him. At that time I was nine."
<P>
3682. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to her, "I was shown you twice in a dream. I saw you
on a piece of silk and it was said, 'This is your wife.' Then it was uncovered
and it was you. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'"
<P>
3683. It is related that Hisham's father said, "Khadija died three year before
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left for Madina. He

<P>
'Abdullah ibn Zayd and Abu Hurayra said from the Prophet,may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, "It is were not for emigration, I would have been
one of the Ansar."
<P>
Abu Musa reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"I saw in a dream that I was emigrating from Makka to a land with palm-trees.
I thought that it was Yamana or Hajar, but it was Madina, Yathrib."
<P>
3684. It is related that Abu Wa'il said, "We visited Khabbab and he said,
'We emigrated with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
seeking the face of Allah, and our reward was up to Allah. Some of us have
gone withou taking any of his reward, and Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr was one of them.
He was killed in the Battle of Uhud and left a cloak. When we covered his
head with it, his feet showed, and if we covered his feet, his head showed.
So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered
us to cover his head and we put some <I>idhkhir</I>-herb over his feet. Some
of us have had its fruits ripen for him in this world and he is harvesting
them.'"
<P>
3685. It is related that 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Actions are but judged according
to intentions. So whoever emigrates to gain something of this world or to
marry a woman, his emigration is for that to which he emigrated. Whoever
emigrates for Allah and His Messenger, his emigration is for Allah and His
Messenger.'"
<P>
3686. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar used to say, "There is no emigration
after the Conquest of Makka."
<P>
3687. It is related that 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah said, "I visited 'A'isha with
'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr al-Laythi and we asked her about emigration. She said,
'There is no emigration today. One of the believers would flee with his deen
to Allah Almighty and to His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, fearing that he would be tempted. Today Allah has made Islam victorious
and the believer can worship his Lord wherever he wishes, but there is
<I>jihad</I> and intention.'"
<P>
3688. It is related that 'A'isha reported that Sa'd said, "O Allah! You know
that there is no one I would rather fight against for Your sake than people
who have denied Your Messenger and expelled, O Allah! I think that you have
ended the war between us and them."
<P>
It is reported from 'A'isha, "a people of Quraysh who denied your Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and expelled him."
<P>
3689. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was sent when he was forty years old. He remained in
Makka for ten years receiving revelation, and then he was commanded to emigrate
and he was an emigrant for ten years, and died when he was sixty-three."
<P>
3690. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, remained in Makka for thirteen years and died when he
was sixty-three."
<P>
3691. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sat on the minbar and said, 'Allah
gave one of His slaves a choice between what he wished of the blessings of
this world and what is with Him. He chose what is with Him.' Abu Bakr wept
and said, 'May our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you!'. We were amazed
at him and the people said, 'Look at this shaykh! The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reports about Allah giving one of
His slaves a choice between the blessings of this world and what is with
Him, and he says, "May our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you"!' However,
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was the
one who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew more than we did. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Abu Bakr
has been, of all people, the most generous to me both with regard to his
company and his property. If I were to have made a close friend of any of
my community, it would have been Abu Bakr, but we have the friendship of
Islam Let no private doorways into the mosque remain except that of Abu Bakr.'"
<P>
3692. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "I have
no recollection of my parents doing anything but following the <I>deen</I>
of Islam. No day would pass without the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, visiting us at either end of it, both morning and
evening. When the Muslims were being persecuted, Abu Bakr departed for Abyssinia
as an emigrant until he reached Bark al-Ghimad where he met Ibn ad-Daghina,
the chief of al-Qara. He asked, 'Where are you going, Abu Bakr?' Abu Bakr
said, 'My people have driven me out. I am intending to travel in the earth
and to worship my Lord.' Ibn ad-Daghina said, 'Someone like you should not
leave nor be driven out. You help the poor, maintain ties of kinship, give
surety for orphans, give hospitality to guests and help people in times of
trouble. I am your protector, so return and worship your Lord in your own
land.' Ibn ad-Daghina travelled and returned with Abu Bakr and went around
to the nobles of the unbelievers of Quraysh and said to them, 'Someone like
Abu Bakr should not leave nor be expelled. Will you expel a man who helps
the poor, maintains ties of kinship, gives surety for orphans, gives hospitality
to guests and helps people in times of trouble? Quraysh allowed the protection
of Ibn ad-Daghina and gave security to Abu Bakr. They said to Ibn ad-Daghina,
'Tell Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and recite as
he likes but not to bother us with it, and he should not make it public.
We fear that he will seduce our sons and women.' Ibn ad-Daghina told that
to Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr began to worship his Lord in his house and not to
do the prayer publicly or recite outside of his house. Then it occurred to
Abu Bakr to build a mosque in the courtyard of his house and he began to
pray in it and recite Qur'an, and the women and sons of the idolaters crowded
around, admiring and looking at it. Abu Bakr was a man prone to weeping and
he could not hold back his tears when he recited Qur'an. That alarmed the
nobles of Quraysh who were idolaters and they sent to Ibn ad-Daghina who
came to them. They said to him, 'We gave protection to Abu Bakr on condition
that he would worship his Lord in his house and he has exceeded that and
built a mosque in the courtyard of his house and has done the prayer and
recitation publicly. We are afraid that he will seduce our sons and women.
Go to him. If he wants to confine himself to worshipping his Lord in his
house, he should do it. If he refuses not to do it in public, then ask him
to return your pledge of protection to you. We dislike to break your pledge
but we will not allow Abu Bakr to worship in public.'"
<P>
'A'isha said, "Ibn ad-Daghina went to Abu Bakr and said, 'You know the basis
on which I gave you the pledge of protection. Either confine yourself to
that or return my pledge to me. I do not want to hear the Arabs say that
I broke my pledge to a man to whom I had given it.' Abu Bakr said, 'I return
your protection to you. I am satisfied with the protection of Allah.' At
that time the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was still in Makka. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'I have been shown your place of emigration. I saw a land
with palm-trees between two lava-fields.' Some people emigrated to Madina
and most of those who had emigrated to the land of Abyssinia returned from
there to Madina. Abu Bakr prepared to emigrate and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'Take your time. I
hope to be given permission.' Abu Bakr said, 'My father be your ransom, do
you hope for that?' He said, 'Yes.' Therefore Abu Bakr kept himself back
in order to accompany the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. He fed two riding-camels he had on acacia leaves which had been
knocked off with a stick for four months."
<P>
'A'isha said, "While we were sitting in the house of Abu Bakr around midday,
someone said to Abu Bakr, 'This is the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, with his head covered at a time at which he did
not used to come to us. Abu Bakr said, 'May my father and mother be his ransom,
by Allah, he has only come at this hour because something has happened.'"
She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
came and asked for permission to enter and was given permission and he entered.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Abu Bakr, 'Send
out those who are with you.' He said, 'They are my family, Messenger of Allah,
may my father be your ransom!' He said, 'I have been given permission to
leave.' He said, 'In company, may my father be your ransom, Messenger of
Allah?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Yes.' Abu Bakr said, 'Take one of these two she-camels, Messenger
of Allah, may my father be your ransom.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I will take it for a price.'"
<P>
'A'isha said, "We prepared what they needed for the journey as quickly as
possible and we put food for the journey in a bag. Asma' bint Abi Bakr cut
a piece from his belt and used it to tie the mouth of the bag, and that is
why she is called, 'She of the two belts.'"
<P>
She said, "Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and Abu Bakr reached a cavel in Mt. Thawr and hid in it for three
days. 'Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, who was a young boy who was clever and
quick-witted, would spend the night with them and he would leave them before
dawn and would be in Makka with Quraysh in the morning as if he had spent
the night there. He did not hear of anything which they were planning about
them but that he would remember it and bring them the news of that when it
became dark. 'Amir ibn Fuhayra, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, would graze
some milk sheep and bring them to them a hour after nightfall. So they had
fresh milk at night, which was the milk of their milk animals and milk heated
with stones. 'Amir ibn Fuhayra would then call the sheep away at the end
of the night. He did that each of the three nights. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr hired a man of the
Banu ad-Dil from the Banu 'Abd ibn 'Adi as an expert guide, (<I>khirrit</I>
means expert guide.) He had taken an oath of alliance with the family of
al-'As ibn Wa'il and followed the religion of the unbelievers of Quraysh.
They both trusted him and gave him their mounts and arranged with him to
meet them at the cave of Thawr after three nights. He brought them their
mounts on the morning of the third day whereupon they set off. 'Amir ibn
Fuhayra and the Dili guide went with them. He took them below Makka along
the coastal route."
<P>
3693. It is related that Suraqa ibn Ju'shum said, "The messengers of the
unbelievers of Quraysh came to us and they put a bounty on both the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr for the one
who killed or captured one of them. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings
of my people, the Banu Mudlij, a man of them came forward and stood before
us while we were sitting down and said, 'O Suraqa! I have just seen some
people on the coast, and I think that it is Muhammad and his companions.'"
Suraqa said, "I recognised that it was them and so I said to him, 'It isn't
them. You have seen so-and-so and so-and-so whom we saw depart.' Then I stayed
in the gathering for a time and then got up and went it and commanded my
slave-girl to bring out my horse which was behind a hill and to keep it for
me. I took my spear and went out from the back of the house, keeping it against
the earth and keeping its point low until I got to my horse and mounted it
and made it gallop to bring me near until I drew near them. Then my horse
stumbled and I fell off it. I got up and stretched my hand to my quiver and
took out the divining arrows from it. I drew them to see whether I should
harm them or not and that which I disliked came out. So I mounted my horse
and disobeyed the arrows and was brought near so that I heard the recitation
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who was
not turning around while Abu Bakr was often turning around. Then my horse's
forelegs sunk into the earth up to the knees and I fell off it. Then I chided
it and it got up but could barely extract its legs. When it stood upright,
there was dust rising in the sky from its feet like smoke. I drew the arrows
and what I disliked came out. I called to them to feel safe and they stopped.
I mounted my horse and came to them. When I encountered what I had done of
being kept from them, it occurred to me that the business of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, will be victorious, so
I said to him, 'Your people have put a bounty on you.' Then I informed them
about the people intended regarding them, and I offered them provision and
goods, but they would not take anything from me and did not ask me for anything
other than the fact that he said, 'Conceal our news.' I asked him to write
a document of security for me and he commaned 'Amir ibn Fuhayra to write
it on a piece of hide and then Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, left."
<P>
3694. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, met az-Zubayr in a caravan of Muslims
who were merchants returning from Syria. Az-Zubayr gave the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr white clothes
and the Muslims in Madina heard about the departure of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Makka. Every morning they would
go out to the lava-field and wait for him until the heat of midday drove
them back. One day after they had waited for a long time, they returned and
when they reached their houses, a Jewish man climbed up on one of their
fortresses for some purpose to which he was attending and he saw the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his companions in
white, shimmering through the heat. The Jew could not help shouting at the
top of hoic voice, "O company of Arabs! This is your important one for whom
you have been waiting!' The Muslims rushed to their weapons and met the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at the top of the lava-field.
He turned with them to the right until he alighted with them among the Banu
'Amr ibn 'Awf. That was on Monday in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal. Abu Bakr
stood up for the people while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, sat in silence. Some of the Ansar who had come who had
not seen the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
began to greet Abu Bakr until the sunshine fell on the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Abu Bakr then went to shade him
with his cloak and then with that the people recognised the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, remained
among the Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf for about ten days and the mosque which was
founded on <I>taqwa</I> was founded and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, prayed in it. Then he mounted his camel and
the people went with him until it knelt at the mosque of the Messenger in
Madina. Some Muslim men used to pray there at that time. It was a place where
dates were dried which belonged to Suhayl and Sahl, two orphan boys in the
care of As'ad ibn Zurara. When his camel knelt there, the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah willing, this is the
place we will alight.' Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, a mosque. They said, 'No, rather we give it to you, Messenger
of Allah.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
refused to accept it from them as a gift. He bought it from them and then
built a mosque there. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, began moving bricks for its construction with them, saying, 'This
load is not the load of Khaybar. This is more pious and purer for our Lord.'
He said, 'O Prophet! The reward is the reward of the Next world, so have
mercy on the Ansar and Muhajirun!' He used an example of some poetry of a
Muslim man who was not named to me."
<P>
Ibn Shihab said, "It has not reached us in hadiths that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used an example of any full
verse of poetry other than this verse."
<P>
3695. It is related that Asma' said, "I prepared the journey provisions for
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu
Bakr when they wanted to go to Madina. I said to my father, 'I do not find
anything with which to tie it except my belt.' He said, 'Cut it in half.'
I did that and that is why I was called, 'the one with two belts.'"
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "Asma', the one with two belts."
<P>
3696. It is related that al-Bara' said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came to Madina, Suraqa ibn Malik ibn Ju'shum followed
him. The Prophet*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, invoked against
him and his horse sank into the ground with him. He said, 'Pray to Allah
for me. I will not harm you,' and so he prayed for him." He said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was thirsty and they passed
by a shepherd. Abu Bakr said, 'I took a bowl and milked a little milk it
and brought it to him and he drank up I was pleased.'"
<P>
3697. It is related from Asma' that she was pregnant with 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr
and she said, "I left when I was at full term and I went to Madina and alighted
at Quba' and gave birth to him at Quba'. Then I took him to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and put him in his lap. He called
for a date which he chewed and then put some of its juice in his mouth. So
the first thing which entered his stomach was the the spit of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Then he rubbed his palate
with a date and prayed for him and asked for blessing on him. He was the
first child born in Islam."
<P>
It is corrobrated from Hisham's father from Asma' that she emigrated to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while she was pregnant."
<P>
3698. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The first child born in Islam was
'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr. They brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
took a date and chewed it a little and then put it in his mouth, so the first
thing that entered his stomach was the saliva of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace."
<P>
3699. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, &Ograve;The Prophet of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, arrived in Madina with Abu Bakr
riding behind him. Abu Bakr was an older man who was known while the Prophet
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was a young man who was
not known." He said, "A man would meet Abu Bakr and say, 'O Abu Bakr! Who
is this man in front of you?' He would say, 'This man guides me to the way.'
One should reckon that he meant the road, but he meant the way to good. Abu
Bakr looked behind and there was a horseman who had caught up to them. He
said, 'Messenger of Allah! This is a horseman who has caught up to us!' The
Messenger of Allah of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, turned
and said, 'O Allah, throw him down!' and the horse threw him. Then it got
up whinnying. He said, 'O Prophet of Allah! command me what you wish.' He
said, 'Stay where you are and do not let anyone catch us.'"
<P>
He said, "At the beginning of the day he was striving against the Prophet
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and at the end of the
day he was defending him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, then alighted beside the lava-bed and then sent to the Ansar
who came to the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and Abu Bakr. They greeted the two of them and then said, 'Mount in security,
being obeyed.' So the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and Abu Bakr mounted and they surrounded them with weapons. It was
said in Madina, 'The Prophet of Allah has come. The Prophet of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came and they began to look and say,
'The Prophet of Allah has come! The Prophet of Allah has come!' He went until
he alighted beside the house of Abu Ayyub. He was speaking with his family
when 'Abdullah ibn Salam heard of him. He was his family's palm trees harvesting
them for them. He went so quickly that he did not put down what he had harvested
for them in the palms. He came with the dates and listened to the Prophet
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then returned to his
family. The Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Which is the nearest of the houses of our people?' Abi Ayyub said, 'Mine,
Prophet of Allah! This is my house and is my door.' He said, 'Go and prepare
a place for our midday rest.' He said, 'Get up with the blessing of Allah.'
<P>
"When the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came,
'Abdullah ibn Salam came and said, 'I testify that you are the Messenger
of Allah and that you have brought the truth. The Jews know that I am their
chief and the son of their chief and the most knowledgeable of them and the
son of the most knowledgeable among them. Summon them and ask them about
me before they know that I have become Muslim. If they know that I have become
Muslim, they will say things about me that are not true.' So the Prophet
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent and they came and
came in to him, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said to them, 'Company of Jews! Woe to you! Fear Allah. By Allah,
there is no god but Him, you know that I am truly the Messenger of Allah
and that I have brought the truth, so become Muslim!' They said, 'We do not
know it.' They said it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and he said that three times. Then he said, 'What kind of man is 'Abdullah
ibn Salam among you?' They said, 'That is chief of us and the son of the
chief of us and the most knowledgeable of us, and the son of the most
knowledgeable of us.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'What would you think if 'Abdullah were to become Muslim'&Oacute;
They said, 'We seek refuge with Allah! He would not become Muslim!' He said,
'Ibn Salam! Come out to them!' He came out and said, 'O company of Jews!
Fear Allah. By Allah, there is no god but He! you know that he is the Messenger
of Allah and that he has brought the truth.' They said, 'You lied!' So the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent them out."
<P>
3700. It is related that Nafi' ibn 'Umar said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab used
to allot four thousand for the first Muhajirun, but he only allotted three
thousand five hundred for Ibn 'Umar. Someone said to him, 'He is one of the
Muhajirun, so why do you give him less than four thousand?' He said, 'His
parents took him with them when they emigrated.'" He said, "So he was not
like those who emigrated on their own account."
<P>
3701. It is related that Khabbab said, "We emigrated with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
It is related that Khabbab said, 'We emigrated with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, seeking the face of Allah, and our reward
was mandatory with Allah. Some of us have gone without consuming any of his
reward, and Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr was one of them. He was killed in the Battle
of Uhud and we did not find anything with which to shroud him except a cloak.
When we covered his head with it, his feet showed, and if we covered his
feet, his head showed. So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, ordered us to cover his head and we put some idhkhir-herb
over his feet. Some of us have had its fruits ripen for him in this world
and he is harvesting them now.'"
<P>
3702. It is related that Abu Burda ibn Abi Musa al-Ash'ari said, "'Abdullah
ibn 'Umar said to me, 'Do you know what my father said to your father?'"
He said, 'I said, 'No.' He said, 'My father said to your father, "O Abu Musa!
Would you be happy that our Islam with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, our emigration with him, our jihad with him
and all our actions with him were confirmed for us while all the actions
which we did after him will be not counted, good or bad?" My father said,
"After the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we
did <I>jihad</I>, prayed and fasted and did much good and many people became
Muslim through us and we have expectations from that." My father said, "As
for myself, by the one who has the soul of 'Umar in His hand, I wish that
it will be confirmed for us and that every thing we did after him would be
not counted, good or bad." I said, 'By Allah, your father was better than
mine!'"
<P>
3703. It is related that Abu 'Uthman said, "I heard Ibn 'Umar became angry
when it was said to him that he had emigrated before his father. He said,
''Umar and I came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and found him having his midday rest and so we returned to hour
home. Then 'Umar sent me, saying, 'Go and see if he had woken up.' I went
to him and went in to him and gave him allegiance. Then I went to 'Umar and
informed him that he had woken up. We went running to him and he went in
to him and gave him allegiance and then I gave him allegiance.'"
<P>
3704. It is related that al-Bara&Otilde; said, &Ograve;Abu Bakr purchased
a saddle from 'Azib and I carried it with him." He said, "'Azib asked him
about the journey of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. He said, 'Look-outs were taken against us, so we left at night.
We travelled quickly through the night and until it was midday. Then a rock
loomed before us and we went to it and it still had some shade left." He
said, "I spread out a hide I had and then the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, lay down on it. I went to look around me and there was
a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, intending what we had intended
from it. I asked him, &Ograve;Whose servant are you?&Oacute; He replied,
'I belong to so-and-so.' I knew him. I said, 'Do your sheep have any milk'
He answered, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you milk for us?' He replied, 'Yes.' He
took one of his sheep and I said to him, 'Clean the dust from the teat.'"
He said, "He milked a little milk for me. I had a small pot of water with
me over which was a rag. I had prepared it for the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I poured it over the milk until
its bottom was cold. Then I took it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and said, 'Drink, Messenger of Allah.' He drank so that
I was pleased. Then we set out while being pursued." Al-Bara' said, "I went
with Abu Bakr into his family and there was his daughter 'A'isha lying down
as she was afflicted by fever. I saw her father kiss her cheek and say, 'How
are you, little daughter?'"

Companions. He dyed his hair with henna and <U>katam</U> which strengthened
its colour."

of the Ansar who gave her allegiance to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, told me that when the Ansar drew lots about lodging
Muhajirun, they got 'Uthman ibn Maz'un to lodge. Umm al-'Ala' said, 'Then
'Uthman became ill and I nursed him until he died and we put him in his clothes.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visited
us. I said, "The mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu's-Sa'ib. I testify to you
that Allah has honoured you." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, asked, "How do you know that Allah has honoured him?" I said,
"I do not know. May my father and mother be your ransom, Messenger of Allah!
Who then will Allah honour?" He said, "By Allah, the Certain has come to
him. By Allah, I hope for the best for him. By Allah, I do not know what
He will do with me in spite of my being the Messenger of Allah." She said,
"By Allah, I never vouched for anyone after that." She said, 'That made me
sad and I went to sleep and I dreamt of a flowing spring for 'Uthman ibn
Ma'zun. I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and informed him and he said, 'That is his actions.'"

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stayed among them for fourteen days.
Then he sent for the Banu'n-Najjar." He said, "They came with their swords
girded on." He said, "It is as if I could see the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, on his camel and Abu Bakr riding behind him with
the Banu'n-Najjar all gathered around him, continuing until he arrived at
the courtyard of Abu Ayyub." He said, "He liked to pray wherever he was when
the prayer time came. He would even pray in sheepfolds". He said, "He ordered
the mosque to be built and sent for a group of the Banu'n-Najjar saying,
'Banu'n-Najjar, tell me the price of this walled garden of yours.' They said,
'No, by Allah! We ask for no payment except from Allah!'" He said, "The place
I am telling you about contained pagan graves and some ruins and also some
palm-trees. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered
the graves of the pagans to be dug up and the ruins to be levelled and the
palm-trees to be cut down." He said, "The palm trunks were lined up to form
the mosque's <I>qibla</I>." He said, "Its two side walls were made of stone."

and no heirs except a daughter. Shall I give two-thirds of my property away
as <I>sadaqa</I>?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Shall I give a half as sadaqa?'
He said, 'No.' He said, 'A third, Sa'd, and a third is a lot. It is better
to leave rich heirs than to leave them poor, begging from other people.'"
<P>
He said, "That you leave heirs, and there is nothing you spend, desiring
by it the face of Allah, but that you will be rewarded, even for a morsel
you put in your wife's mouth.' I said, 'Messenger of Allah, will I be left
behind after my companions leave?' He said, 'You will not be left behind,
for any virtuous actions you do will raise you in degree and elevation. And
then you might be left behind so that some people will benefit from you and
others harmed by you. O Allah, let My Companions' complete their emigration
and do not let them turn back on their heels, but poor Sa'd ibn Khawla!'

'May Allah bless you in your family and propety! Direct me to the market.'
He made a small profit in dried yoghurt and ghee. Some days later the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw him with traces of yellow scent
on him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'What
is this, 'Abdu'r-Rahman?' He said, 'I have married a woman of the Ansar.'

Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'Hold a
wedding-feast, even if only with a sheep.'"
<P>

arrival of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
in Madina, he went to him to ask him about some things and said, 'I will
ask you about three things which only a Prophet knows. What is the first
sign of the Final Hour? What is the first food that the people of the Garden
will eat? And for what reason does a child resemble his father and for what
reason does he resemble his maternal uncles?' He said, 'Jibril has just informed
me about them.'Ibn Salam said, 'That is the enemy of the Jews among the
angels.' He said, "The first sign of the Final Hour will be a fire which
will gather people from the east to the west. The first food that the people
of the Garden will eat will be the extra bit of the liver of the fish. As
for the childs resemblance, when the man has intercourse with the woman
and his discharge is first, it will resemble him. If she has a discharge
first, then it will resemble her.' He said, 'I testify that you are the Messenger
of Allah.' Then he said, 'O Messenger of Allah, the Jews are a calumnious
people.'. The Jews came and Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'What kind of man is 'Abdullah ibn Salam among you?' They said, 'The
most knowledgeable of us, and the son of the most knowledgeable of us, and
the best of us and the son of the best of us.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'What would you think if 'Abdullah ibn Salam
were to become Muslim?' They said, 'We seek refuge with Allah from that!'
He repeated that to them and they said something similar. 'Abdullah came
out to them and said, 'I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify
that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.' They said, 'The worst of us and
the son of the worst of us,' and began to disparage him. He said, 'This is
what I feared, Messenger of Allah.'"
<P>
3724. It is related that Abu'l-Minhal 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Mut'im said, "Sharik
sold me some dirhams in the market with delayed payment and I said, 'Glory
be to Allah! Is this permissible?" He said, 'By Allah, I sold it in the market
and no one criticised us for it. So I asked al-Bara' ibn 'Azib and he said,
'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to Madina when
we were making this transaction and he said, "There is no harm if it is hand
to hand. There is no harm if it is hand to hand. If there is a delay, then
it is not permissible." Go and meet Zayd ibn Arqam and asked him, as he is
the greatest trader of us.' So I asked Zayd ibn Arqam and he said the like
of it."

him peace, parted his hair.
