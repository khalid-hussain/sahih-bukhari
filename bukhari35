Encouragement to marry</B><P>By the words of the Almighty, <I>"Then marry other permissible women."</I>(4:3)<P>4776. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "A group of three men cameto the houses of the wives of the Prophet , may Allah bless him and granthim peace, to ask about how the Prophet worshipped. When they were told,it was as if they thought it was little and said, 'Where are we in relationto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who hasbeen forgiven his past and future wrong actions?'" He said, "One of themsaid, 'I will pray all of every night.' Another said, 'I will fast all thetime and not break the fast.' The other said, "I will withdraw from womenand never marry.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, came to them and said, 'Are you the ones who said such-and-such? ByAllah, I am the one among you with the most fear and awareness of Allah,but I fast and break the fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoeverdisdains my sunna is not with me.'"<P>4777. It is related by 'Urwa that he asked 'A'isha about the words of theAlmighty,<I> "If you are afraid of not behaving justly towards orphans, thenmarry other permissible women, two, three or four. But if you are afraidof not treating them equally, then only one, or those you own as slaves.That makes it more likely that you will not be unfair." </I>(4:3) 'A'ishasaid, "Nephew, an orphan girl may be in the care of her guardian who is attractedby her wealth and beauty and then he wants to marry her for a bride-priceless than what is customary for someone like her. They were forbidden tomarry them unless they are fair to them and give them their full bride-price.They were commanded to marry other women instead."<P><B>II. The words of the Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"Any of you who can afford it should marry. It lowers the eyes and preservesthe genitals."</B><P><B>Does someone marry who has no desire for marriage?</B><P>4778. It is related that 'Alqama said, "While I was walking with 'Abdullah,'Uthman met him at Mina and said, 'Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman, I need to speak toyou.' They went aside and 'Uthman said, 'Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman, shall we marryyou to a virgin who will remind of your past youth?' When 'Abdullah saw thathe had not need of this, he gestured to me, saying, ''Alqama!' I went tohim when he saying, 'Since you have said this, the Prophet , may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said to us, "Company of young men! Any of you whocan afford to should marry. It restrains the eye and protects the privateparts. Anyone who is unable to should fast. It restrains the appetite."'"<P><P><B>III. "Anyone who cannot marry, should fast"</B><P>4779. It is related 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Yazid said, "I visited 'Abdullah with'Alqama and al-Aswad. 'Abdullah said, 'We were with the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, when we were young men and had nothing atall. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidto us, "Company of young men! Any of you who can afford it should marry.It lowers the eyes and preserves the genitals. Anyone who is unable to shouldfast. It restrains the appetite."'"<P><P><B>IV. Having several wives</B><P>4780. it is related that 'Ata' said, "We attended the funeral of Maymunaat Sarif with Ibn 'Abbas. Ibn 'Abbas said, 'This is the wife of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When you lift her bier, do not rockor shake it. Be gentle. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,had nine wives. He divided nights between eight of them, and one of them*had no turn.'"<P>[* This was Sawda.]<P>4781. It is related from Anas: "The Prophet , may Allah bless him and granthim peace, used to go around to all his wives in one night. and he had ninewives."<P>It is related from Qatada from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace ...<P>4782. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "Ibn 'Abbas asked me, 'Haveyou married?' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Marry. The best of this communityhad the greatest number of wives.'"<P><P><B>V. Someone who emigrates or does a good action with the aim of marryinga woman has what he intended</B><P>4783. It is related from 'Umar ibn al-Khattab that the Prophet , may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Actions only go by intentions. Everyonegets what they intend. Anyone, therefore, who emigrates to Allah and HisMessenger, his emigration is indeed to Allah and His Messenger. But anyonewho emigrates to gain something of this world or to marry a woman, his emigrationis to that to which he emigrated."<P><P><B>VI. Someone who is poor marrying a woman for what he knows of the Qur'anand being Muslim</B><P>Sahl ibn Sa'd mentioned it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>4784. It is related that Ibn Mas'ud said, "We used to go on expeditions withthe Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, without our wives.We said, 'Messenger of Allah, should we get castrated?' He forbade us todo that."<P><P><B>VII. A man saying to his brother, "See which of my wives you want andI will give her up in your favour."</B><P>'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf related it.<P>4785. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf arrivedin Madina and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, establishedbrotherhood between me and Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi' al-Ansari. The Ansari had twowives and he offered to split his wives and property with him. 'Abdu'r-Rahmansaid, 'May Allah bless you in your family and property. Just show me themarket.' He went to the market and made a profit selling dried yoghurt andghee. The Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw him somedays later with a smear of yellow scent on him. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said to him, 'What is this, 'Abdu'r-Rahman?' Hereplied, 'I have married a woman of the Ansar.' He asked, 'What did you giveher?' He answered, 'The weight of a date-stone of gold.' The Prophet said,'Hold a wedding-feast, even if only with a sheep.'"<P><P><B>VIII. What is disliked of celibacy and castration</B><P>4786. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "I heard Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas say, 'TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade celibacyto 'Uthman ibn Maz'un. If he had allowed that him to do that, we would havehad ourselves castrated.'"<P>Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab reported that he heard Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas say "He(i.e. the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace) forbade 'Uthmanibn Maz'un to do that. If he had allowed him celibacy, we would have hadourselves castrated."<P>4787. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "We used to go on expeditions withthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when wehad nothing. We asked, 'Should we get castrated?' He forbade us to do that.Then he made an allowance for us to marry a woman for a price. Then he recitedto us: <I>'O you who believe, do not make unlawful the good things Allahhas made lawful for you, and do not overstep the limits. Allah does not lovepeople who overstep the limits.' </I>(5:87)"<P>4788. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah,I am a young man and I fear fornication for myself. I cannot afford to marrywomen.' He was silent. Then I repeated the like of that and he remained silent.Then I repeated the like of that yet again and he was silent. Then I saidthe like of that and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Abu Hurayra, The pen is dry, having written what you will encounter,whether you are castrated or not.'"<P><P><B>IX. Marrying virgins</B><P>Ibn Abi Mulayka said that Ibn 'Abbas said to 'A'isha, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, did not marry any virgin besides me."<P>4789. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, if youwere to alight in a valley which had a tree which had been eaten from anda trees which had not been eaten from, on which of them would you graze yourcamel?' He replied, 'On the one which had not been grazed on before.' Bythat she meant meant that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, had not married a virgin besides her."<P>4790. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Messenger of Alla, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "I saw shown you twice in a dream. Aman was carrying you in a silk cloth and said, 'This is your wife.' He uncoveredit and it was you. I said, 'If this is from Allah He will bring it about.'"<P><P><B>X. Marrying women who were married previously</B><P>Umm Habiba said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidto me, 'Do not offer me your daughters or your sisters.'"<P>4791. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "While we were returningfrom an expedition with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,I started to urge on my camel which was slow. A rider caught up to me frombehind and poked my camel with a speak he had. My camel started to move likethe best camel you could see. It was the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, who then asked, 'What makes you hurry?' I said, 'I am newlymarried.' He asked, 'A virgin or a woman who was married previously?' I replied,'A woman who was married previously.' He asked, 'Why not a virgin whom youcould play with and who could play with you?' When we were about to enterMadina, he said, 'Wait so that you enter at night (i.e. the evening) so thata woman with untidy hair can comb her hair and one whose husband has beenabsent can shave her pubic hair.'"<P>4792. Muharib said, "I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, 'I married and theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked me, "What[sort of woman] have you married?" I replied, "A woman previously married.He said, "Don't you like virgins and dallying with them?"' I mentioned thatto 'Amr who said, 'I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'Why not a virgin whomyou could play with and who could play with you?'"'"<P><P><B>XI. Marrying young people to old people</B><P>4793. It is related from 'Urwa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, asked Abu Bakr for 'A'isha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakrsaid to him, "I am your bother." He said, "You are my brother in the deenof Allah and His Book. She is lawful for me."<P><P><B>XII. Who should one marry? Which sort of woman is best? What sort womenit is recommended to choose for the sake of progeny without that beingcompulsory</B><P><B> </B>4794. It is related by Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "The best of women are the riders of camels,the righteous women of Quraysh. They are the most compassionate to theirchildren when they are young and most prudent with the property of theirhusbands."<P><P><B>XIII. Taking female captives. Someone freeing his slavegirl and then marryingher</B><P>4795. The father of Abu Burda said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Any man who has a slavegirl whom heteaches and teaches well, and teaches adab (i.e. good manners) so that shehas good adab and then frees her and marries her will have two rewards. Ifany man of the People of the Book believes in his own Prophet and believesin me, he will have two rewards. Any slave who fulfils his duty to both hismasters and his Lord will have two rewards."<P>Ash-Sha'bi said, "Take it for nothing. A man used to travel to Madina forless than it."<P>It is related from Abu Burda's father that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Free her and then give her a dower."<P>4796. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said...<P>It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Ibrahim only told three lies. Whilehe was with Sara, he went by one of the tyrants who was told ... (and hementioned the hadith). He gave her Hajar and she said, 'Allah restrainedthe hand of the unbeliever and gave me Hajar.'" Abu Hurayra said, "That isyour mother, <I>Banu ma's as-sama'</I>." (see hadith 2104)<P>(<I>Banu ma's as-sama</I>' means: sons of the the water of the sky, i.e.the Arabs.)<P>4797. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, remained between Khaybar and Madina for three nights whenhe married Safiyya. I invited the Muslims to his wedding feast. There wasno bread or meat in it, but he only commanded that a leather mat be spreadout on which were placed some dates, dried yoghurt and ghee. That was hiswedding feast. The Muslims said, 'Is she one of the Mothers of the Believersor his slave [lit. what his right hand owns]?' They said, 'If he veils her,then she is one of the Mothers of the Believers. If he does not veil her,then she is part of his property.' When he travelled, he made a place forher behind him and extended the covering between her and the people."<P><P><B>XIV. The one who made the emancipation of a slavegirl her dower</B><P>4798. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, set Safiyya free and made her emancipation her dower."<P><P><B>XV. Marrying someone who is poor</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"If they are poor Allah will enrich them fromHis bounty."</I> (24:32)<P>4799. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that a woman came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger ofAllah, I have come to give myself to you (to dispose of in marriage)." Heraised his eyes to her and then looked and then lowered his head. When thewoman saw that he had not made any decision about her, she sat down. Oneof his Companions stood up and said, "Messenger of Allah, if you have noneed of her, then marry her to me." He asked, "Do you have anything [to giveher]?" He said, "By Allah, no, Messenger of Allah." He said, "Go to yourfamily and see if you can find something." The man went and returned andsaid, "No, Messenger of Allah, I did not find anything." He said, "Look,even if it is an iron ring." He went and then came back and said, "By Allah,Messenger of Allah, no. I did not even find an iron ring, but I have thiswaist-wrapper." Sahl said, "He did not have a cloak and so she could havehalf do it." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "What will see do with your waist-wrapper? If you wear it, she willhave none of it, and if she wears it, you will have none of it." The mansat down for a long time and then got up. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, saw him going away and commanded someone tocall him. When he came back, he asked, "What do you know of the Qur'an?"He replied, "I know this <I>sura</I>, that <I>sura</I>, and that<I>sura</I>," and he named them. He asked, "Do you recite that by heart?""Yes," he replied. He said, "Go, I have married you to her for what you knowof the Qur'an."<P><P><B>XVI. Equivalence in the <I>deen</I></B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"And it is He who created the human being fromwater and then gave him relations by blood and marriage. Your Lord isAll-Powerful." </I>(25:54)<P>4800. It is related from 'A'isha that Abu Hudhayfa ibn 'Utba ibn Rabi'a,who was one of those who was present at Badr with the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, adopted Salim and married him to his niece,Hind bint al-Walid ibn 'Utba ibn Rabi'a. Salim was the client (<I>mawla</I>)of a woman of the Ansar. It was as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, had adopted Zayd. In the Jahiliyya, when someone adopted a man,people called him by his name and he inherited from him. That lasted untilAllah revealed, <I>"Call them after their fathers. That is juster in Allah'ssight. And if you do not know who their fathers were then they are your brothersin the deen and people under your patronage." </I>(33:5) Therefore theyattributed them to their real fathers. If the father of someone was not known,he was a client and brother in the <I>deen</I>. Sahla bint Suhayl ibn 'Amral-Qurashi al-'Amiri, the wife of Abu Hudhayfa, came to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger of Allah, we usedto consider Salim to be a son and Allah has revealed what you know." Andhe mentioned the <I>hadith</I>. (See 3778).<P>4801. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, visited Duba'a bint az-Zubayr and said toher, 'Perhaps you want to go on <I>hajj</I>.' She replied, "By Allah, I feelill.' He said to her, 'Go on <I>hajj</I> and make a stipulation, "O AllahI will come out of <I>ihram</I> wherever I am prevented from continuing."'She was married to al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad.*]<P>[* Duba'a bint az-Zubayr was the niece of the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace. Al-Miqdad was an ally who had been adopted, thus indicatingthat equivalence in lineage was not a requirement in marriage.]<P>4802. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet , may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "A woman can be married for four reasons: herwealth, her lineage, her beauty, and her religion. Seek the one with religion.May your hands be in the dust!"<P>4803. It is related that Sahl said, "A man passed by the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who said, 'What do you say aboutthis one?' They answered, 'He is such that if he proposes marriage, his proposalis accepted, and if he intercedes his intercession would be granted. If hespeaks, he is listened to.' Then he was silent and one of the poor Muslimmen passed by and he asked, 'What do you say about this one?' They answered,"He is such that if he were to propose marriage, his proposal would not beworth accepting, and if he were to intercede, his intercession would notbe granted, and if he were to speak, his words would not be listened to.'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Thisone is better than the whole earth full of the first one.'"<P><P><B>XVII. Equality in wealth, and a poor man marrying a wealthy woman</B><P>4804. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr asked 'A'isha about the wordsof Allah Almighty, <I>"If you are afraid of not behaving justly towards orphans."</I>(4:3) She said, "O nephew! That is the orphan girl who is in the careof her guardian and shares his property. Her guardian admires her wealthand beauty, and so he may want to marry her without being fair about herdower. They are forbidden to marry them unless they are fair to them andgive them the full dower and are commanded to marry other women."<P>She said, "Then the people asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, for a pronouncement after this and Allah revealed,'They will ask you for a definitive ruling about women. Say,<I> "Allah givesyou a definitive ruling about them; and also what is recited to you in theBook about orphan girls to whom you do not give the inheritance they areowed, while at the same time desiring to marry them."' </I>(4:127) Allahrevealed to them that if an orphan has beauty and wealth, and they wantedto marry to marry her [for that] and her lineage, they must give them thefull dower. If they did not want to marry them because of their lack of wealthand beauty, they should leave them and marry other women.' She added, 'Asthey used to leave them when they did not desire them, they cannot marrythem when they desire them unless they were fair to them and gave them theirfull right in the dower.'"<P><P><B>XVIII. What one is cautious about in bad luck in a woman</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"Some of your wives and children are an enemyto you."</I> (64:14)<P>4805. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is bad luck in women,houses and horses."<P>4806. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "They mentioned bad luck in thepresence of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If there is badluck in anything, it is in houses, women and horses."<P>4807. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "If it is in anything, it is in horses,women and houses."<P>4808. It is related from Usama ibn Zayd that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "I have not left after me a trial more harmfulto men than women."<P><P><B>XIX. A free woman marrying a slave</B><P>4809. It is related that 'A'isha said, "There were three sunnas as a resultof Barira. She was set free and was given a choice (of remaining marriedor not). The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "The <I>wala</I>' is for the one who set free. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came in when there was a pot onthe fire, but he was given bread and condiments from the house. He said,'Do I not see the pot?' He was told, 'That is meat given as <I>sadaqa</I>to Barira. You do not eat <I>sadaqa</I>.' He said, 'It is <I>sadaqa</I> forher and a gift for us.'"<P><P><B>XX. Not marrying more than four women</B><P>This is based on the words of Allah, <I>"Then marry other permissible women,two, three or four." </I>(4:3)<P>'Ali ibn al-Husayn, peace be upon them, said, "It means two, three or four."<P>The words of Allah, <I>"Angels having two or three or four wings," </I>(35:1),meaning two, three or four."<P>4810. It is related from 'A'isha about "<I>If you are afraid of not behavingjustly</I>..." (4:3) that she said, "That is the orphan girl who is in thecare of her guardian. He wants to marry her for her wealth but treats herbadly and is not equitable with her property. Therefore he should marry otherwomen that please him: two, three or four.'"<P><P><B>XXI. <I>"Unlawful to you are ... your foster mothers who have suckledyou."</I> (4:23)</B><P>Suckling makes unlawful what lineage makes unlawful.<P>4811. It is related from 'Amra bint 'Abdu'r-Rahman that 'A'isha, the wifeof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, informed her thatwhile the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, waswith her she heard the sound of a man asking permission to enter the houseof Hafsa. 'A'isha said, "Messenger of Allah, this man is asking permissionto enter your house." She said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'I think it is so-and-so,' the uncle of Hafsa by suckling."'A'isha said, "If so-and-and (her uncle by suckling) has been alive, couldhe have visited me?" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "Yes, suckling make unlawful what birth makes unlawful."<P>4812. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that it was said to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Will you not marry the daughterof Hamza?" He replied, "She is my brother's daughter by suckling."<P>The like of it is related from Jabir ibn Zayd.<P>4813. It is related that Umm Habiba bint Abi Sufyan said, "'Messenger ofAllah, marry my sister, the daughter of Abu Sufyan.' He asked, 'Do you likethat?' 'Yes,' she answered, 'I am not your only wife and I want to sharewith my sister in good.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'That is not lawful for me.' I said, 'We have heard that you want tomarry the daughter of Abu Salama.' He said, 'The daughter of Umm Salama?''Yes,' I replied. He said, 'Even if she were not my foster-daughter in mycare, she still would not be lawful for me. She is the daughter of my brotherby suckling. Thuwayba nursed both me and Abu Salama. Do not offer your daughtersor sisters to me.'"<P>'Urwa said, "Thuwayba was the freed slave of Abu Lahab. Abu Lahab set herfree and she suckled the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When Abu Lahab died, one of his relatives saw Abu Lahab in a dream in avery bad state and asked him, 'What have you encountered?' Abu Lahab said,'I did not find any rest after you except that I am given this amount todrink on account of my setting Thuwayba free."<P><P><B>XXII. The one who said that there is no suckling after two years by thewords of Allah Almighty, <I>"Two full years those who wish to complete thefull term of nursing"</I> (2:333)</B><P>What is made unlawful by a little and a lot of suckling<P>4814. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, came to her while a man was with her. It seemed thathis facial expression changed as if he disliked that. She said, "He is mybrother." He said, "Look into your brothers. Suckling is from hunger [i.e.for children]."<P><P><B>XXIII. Male milk relations</B><P>4815. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Aflah, the brother of Abu'l-Qu'ays,asked permission to visit me after the Veil was revealed. He was my uncleby suckling. I refused to give him permission. When the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came, I told him what I had doneand he ordered me to give him permission."<P><P><B>XXIV. The testimony of the nurse</B><P>4816. It is related that 'Uqba ibn al-Harith said, "I married a woman andthen a black woman came to us and stated, 'I nursed both of you.' I wentto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I marriedso-and-so and then a black woman came to us and said to me, "I nursed bothof you." She is lying.' He turned away from me, and I moved to face him andrepeated, 'She is lying.' He said, 'How can you keep her when she claimsthat she nursed both of you? Leave her.'" (Isma'il [ibn Ibrahim, who narratedit to al-Bukhari] made a gesture with his forefinger and middle finger.)<P><P><B>XXV. Those women it is lawful to marry and those women it is unlawfulto marry</B><P>The words of Allah,<I> "Unlawful for you are: your mothers and your daughtersand your sisters, your maternal aunts and your paternal aunts, your brothers'daughters and your sisters' daughters, your foster mothers who have suckledyou, your foster sisters by suckling, your wives' mothers, your stepdaughterswho are under your protection: the daughters of your wives whom you havehad sexual relations with, (though if you have not had sexual relations withthem there is nothing blameworthy for you in it then ) the wives of yoursons whom you have fathered, and marrying two sisters at the same time &#150;except for what took place in the past. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, MostMerciful.</I><P><I> And also married women &#150; except those you have taken in war as slaves.This is what Allah has prescribed for you. Apart from that He has made allother women lawful for you provided you seek them with your wealth in marriageand not in fornication.

A client of his saidto him, 'That is only when the situation is severe and women are few,' orsomething like that. Ibn 'Abbas said, 'Yes.'"<P>4827. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah and Salama ibn al-Akwa' said,"We were in an army when the messenger of the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, came to us and said, 'You have been givenpermission to practise the <I>mut'a</I>, so do so."<P>Salama ibn al-Akwa' reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "If a man and a woman agree [to a temporarymarriage] then the association between them lasts for three nights.

A woman offering herself to a righteous man</B><P>4828. It is related that Thabit al-Bunani said, "I was with Anas while hisdaughter was with him. Anas said, 'A woman came to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and offered herself to him and said,"Messenger of Allah, do you have any need of me?"' Anas' daughter said, 'Howimmodest she was! Shame! Shame!' He said, 'She was better than you. She likedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and offered herselfto him.'"<P>4829. It is related that Sahl said, "A woman offered herself to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and a man said, 'Messenger of Allah,marry her to me.' He asked, 'What do you have?' He answered, 'I have nothing.'He said, 'Look for something, even if it is an iron ring.' He went and thencame back and said, 'No, by Allah, I did not even find an iron ring, butI have this waist-wrapper and she can have half of it.'" Sahl said, "He didnot have a cloak. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'What will she do with your waist-wrapper? If you wear it, shewill have none of it, and if she wears it, you will have none of it.' Theman sat down for a long time and then got up. The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, saw him and called him or commandedsomeone to call him. He asked him, 'What do you know of the Qur'an?' He replied,"I know this sura, that sura, and that sura," and he named a number of suras.The Prophet said, 'I have married you to her for what you know of the Qur'an.'"<P><P><B>XXXIV. A person offering his daughter or sister to the people of good</B><P>4830. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar reported that he heard 'Umaribn al-Khattab say that when Hafsa bint 'Umar became a widow at the deathof Khunays ibn Hudhafa as-Sahmi, who was one of the Companions of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who died in Madina, 'Umaribn al-Khattab said, "I went to 'Uthman ibn 'Affan [to offer to marry herto him] and he said, 'Let me reflect on it.' A few days later he met me andsaid, 'It seems to me that I should not marry at this time.'" 'Umar said,"Then I met Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, 'If you wish, I will marry you toHafsa bint 'Umar.' Abu Bakr was silent and did not give me any reply at all,and that was more painful to me than 'Uthman. Some days later the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, proposed to her and Imarried her to him. Abu Bakr met me and said, 'Perhaps you were pained byme when you offered me Hafsa and I did not reply to you?' I said, 'Yes.'He said, 'I was only prevented from replying to you in your offer by thefact that I knew that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, had mentioned her and I would not divulge the secret of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. If he had left her, Iwould have accepted her.'"<P>4831. Zaynab bint Salama reported that Umm Habiba said to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "We are saying that you aregoing to marry Durra bint Abi Salama. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Along with Umm Salama? Even if I were notmarried to Umm Salama, she would not be lawful for me. Her father is my brotherby nursing."<P><P><B>XXXV. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Nor is there anything wrong inany allusion to marriage you make to a woman, nor for any you keep to yourself.Allah knows that you will say things to them. But do not make secret arrangementswith them, rather only speak with correctness and courtesy. Do not finallydecide on the marriage contract until the prescribed period has come to itsend. Know that Allah knows what is in your selves, so beware of Him! Andknow that Allah is Ever-Forgiving, All-Forbearing." </I>(2:235)</B><P>"<I>Aknantum</I>" means "to conceal. That which you hide or conceal is"<I>maknun</I>".<P>It is reported from Ibn 'Abbas that "allusion to marriage" is to say thingslike, "I want to marry" and "I wish that a righteous woman would be madeavailable for me."<P>Al-Qasim said, "It is that he says, 'I think you are not noble' and 'I desireyou', 'Allah will bring you good,' and the like of that.<P>'Ata' said, "One alludes and does not state openly. He says, 'I have a need,''Give good news', 'You are free by the praise of Allah.' She says, 'I hearwhat you say,' but she does not promise anything nor does her guardian promisewithout her knowledge. If she makes a promise to a man while in her<I>'idda</I> and then marries him later, they are not separated.'<P>Al-Hasan said, "'Do not make a secret contract with them' means fornication."<P>It is mentioned from from Ibn 'Abbas that <I>"until the prescribed term hascome to an end" </I>is the <I>'idda</I>.<P><P><B>XXXVI. Looking at a woman before marrying her</B><P>4832. It is reported that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'I was shown you in a dream. Anangel brought you to me on a piece of silk and I was told, "This is yourwife." I removed the cloth from your face and it was you. I said, "If thisis from Allah, it will be done."'"<P>4833. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that a woman came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger ofAllah, I have come to give myself to you (to dispose of in marriage)." TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked at herand raised his glance to her carefully and then lowered his head. When thewoman saw that he had not made any decision about her, she sat down. Oneof his Companions stood up and said, "Messenger of Allah, if you have noneed of her, then marry her to me." He asked, "Do you have anything [to giveher]?" He said, "By Allah, no, Messenger of Allah." He said, "Go to yourfamily and see if you can find something." The man went and returned andsaid, "No, Messenger of Allah, I did not find anything." He said, "Look,even if it is an iron ring." He went and then came back and said, "By Allah,Messenger of Allah, no. I did not even find an iron ring, but I have thiswaist-wrapper." Sahl said, "He did not have a cloak and so she could havehalf do it." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "What will see do with your waist-wrapper? If you wear it, she willhave none of it, and if she wears it, you will have none of it." The mansat down for a long time and then got up. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, saw him going away and commanded someone tocall him. When he came back, he asked, "What do you know of the Qur'an?"He replied, "I know this sura, that sura, and that sura," and he named them.He asked, "Do you recite that by heart?" "Yes," he replied. He said, "Go,I have married you to her for what you know of the Qur'an."<P><P><B>XXXVII. The one who said that there is no marriage without a<I>wali</I></B><P>Allah Almighty says, <I>"Do not prevent them from marrying their first husbands."</I>(2:232)<P>This includes the previously married woman as well as the virgin. He says<I>,"And do not marry idolatrous men until they believe"</I> (2:221) and He says,<I>"Marry off those among you who are unmarried."</I> (24:32)<P>4834. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that 'A'isha, the wife of theProphet, &nbsp;may Allah bless him and grant him peace, informed him thatthere four types of marriage in the Jahiliyya. There was the marriage whichis that still practised by people today in which a man asked another manfor his ward or daughter, paid her her dower and then married her. Anothertype was that a man would say to his wife after she was pure from menstruation,"Send for so-and-so and have intercourse with him." Her husband would stayaway from her and not have sex with her until she became pregnant by thatman with whom she was sleeping. When it was clear that she was pregnant,then her husband would sleep with her if he wished. He did that out of thedesire for a child of noble descent. This marriage was called<I>al-Istibda'</I>. Another type of marriage was that a group of less thanten men would go to the same woman and all have intercourse with her. Ifshe became pregant and gave birth, some days after the birth she would sendfor them, and none of them could refuse to come. When they were gatheredtogether before her, she would say to them, "You know what you did. I havegiven birth. It is your son, so-and-so!" She would name whichever of themshe wanted to name, and her child would be attributed to him and the mancould not deny that. The fourth type of marriage was that many men wouldgo to a woman who would not refuse whoever came to her. They were prostitutesand they used to set up flags at the doors as signs. Whoever wanted couldgo to them. If one of them became pregnant, when she gave birth, they wouldbe brought together and they would call the physiognomists who would thenattach the child to the one they thought was the father. He would be ascribedto him and called his son. None of them could reject that. When Muhammad,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was sent with the truth, he abolishedall of the marriages of the Jahiliyya except the marriage practised by peopletoday.<P>4835. It is related from 'A'isha about,<I> "And also what is recited to youin the Book about orphan girls to whom you do not give the inheritance theyare owed, while at the same time desiring to marry them" </I>(4:127), "Itis about the orphan girl in the care of a man. She might share in his propertyand he has more right to her, but does not desire to marry her but&nbsp;prevents her, because of her property, from marrying someone else,disliking for anyone else to share her property with him."<P>4836. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that when Hafsa bint 'Umar became a widowat the death of Ibn Hudhafa as-Sahmi, who was one of the Companions of theProphet, Messenger of Allah and one of those present at Badr. He died inMadina. 'Umar said, "I met 'Uthman ibn 'Affan and made him an offer, saying,'If you wish, I will marry you to Hafsa.' He said 'I will think about it.'I waited some days and then he met me and said, 'It seems to me that I shouldnot marry at this time.'" 'Umar said, 'I met Abu Bakr and said, 'If you wish,I will marry you to Hafsa.'"<P>4837. It is related from al-Hasan about <I>"Do not prevent them" </I>(2:232):"Ma'qil ibn Yasar told me that it was revealed about him. He said, 'I marrieda sister of mine to a man who then divorced her. When her <I>'idda </I>wasover, he came and asked to marry her. I told him, "I married her to you andmade her your bed and honoured you with her, and then you divorced her. Nowyou come asking to marry her? No, by Allah, she will never go back to you!"There was nothing bad about the man and the woman wanted to go back to him.So Allah revealed this <I>ayat</I>: "<I>Do not prevent them</I>." (2:232)I said, "Now I will do it, Messenger of Allah."' He married her to him."<P><P><B>XXXVIII. When the guardian is the suitor</B><P>Al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba proposed to a woman when he was her closest guardian,and he ordered another man to give her in marriage to him.<P>'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf said to Umm Hakim bint Qariz, "Will you assign yourbusiness to me?" "Yes," she replied. He said, "Then I have married you."<P>'Ata' said, "He should testify, 'I have married you,' or command that oneof his tribe (do it)."<P>Sahl said, "A woman said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, 'I have given myself to you,' and a man said, 'Messenger of Allah,if you have no need of her, then marry her to me.'"<P>4838. It is related from 'A'isha about the <I>ayat</I>,<I> "They will askyou for a definitive ruling about women. Say, 'Allah gives you a definitiveruling about them...'</I>" (4:127), ""It is about the orphan girl in thecare of a man. She might share in his property and he has more right to her,but does not desire to marry her but &nbsp;prevents her, because of her property,from marrying someone else, disliking for anyone else to share her propertywith him. Allah forbade them to do that."<P>4839. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "While we were sitting withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a woman came and offeredherself. He looked at her, lowering and raising his look, but did not answerher. One of his Companions said, ''Marry her to me, Messenger of Allah.'He asked, 'Do you have anything?' 'I do not have anything, ' he replied.He said, 'Not even an iron ring?' 'Not even an iron ring,' he answered. 'ButI can tear this robe of mine in half and give her half while I keep half.'He said, 'No. Do you know any of the Qur'an?' 'Yes,' he replied. He said,'Go. I have married you to her for what you have of the Qur'an.'"<P><P><B>XXXIX.

It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, married her when she was six years old and consummated itwhen she was nine, and she was his wife for nine years.<P><P><B>XLI. The ruler acts as the guardian</B><P>This is because the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"We have married her to you for what you know of the Qur'an."<P>4842. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "A woman came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I have givenmyself to you.' She stood for a long time. A man said, 'If you are not inneed of her, marry her to me.' He asked, 'Do you have anything to give usas a dowry?' 'He answered, 'I only have my wasist wrapper.' He said, 'Ifyou give it to her, you will sit without no waist wrapper. Look for something.'He said, 'I did not find anything.' He said, 'Look for something, even aniron ring.' He did not find it.

Neither a father nor anyone else can give a virgin or previous marriedwoman in marriage without her consent</B><P>4843. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "A previously married woman should not be marrieduntl she has been consulted. A virgin is not married until she is asked forher permission." They said, "Messenger of Allah, how does she give permission?"He replied, "It is when she is silent."<P>4844. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Messenger of Allah, a virgin is shy!"He said, "Her consent is her silence."<P><P><B>XLIII. When a man gives his daughter in marriage against her will, themarriage is invalid</B><P>4845. It is related from Khansa' bint Khidham al-Ansariyya that her fathergave her in marriage when she had been married before and she disliked that.She went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,who cancelled the marriage.<P>It is related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Yazid and Mujammi' ibn Yazid that aman called Khidham gave a daughter of her in marriage...<P><P><B>XLIV. Giving an orphan girl in marriage</B><P>by the words of Allah, "<I>If you are afraid of not behaving justly towardsorphans, then marry other permissible women</I>." (4:3)<P>When someone says to a guardian, "Marry so-and-so to me," and the guardianremains silent for a time or asks, "What have you got?" And the suitor says,"I have such-and-such," or keeps quiet and then the guardian says, "I havemarried her to you," then the marriage is allowed. In the <I>isnad</I>, Sahlreported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>4846. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that he asked 'A'isha, "Mother,what about '<I>If you are afraid of not behaving justly towards orphans</I>.'(4:3)?" 'A'isha said, "Nephew, this is the orphan girl who is in the careof her guardian who desires her beauty and wealth and wanted to diminishher dower. They were forbidden to marry them unless they were fair to themand gave them the full dower. They were commanded to marry women other thanthem who pleased them."<P>'A'isha said, "After this <I>ayat</I> people asked the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for a decision, and Allah sent down,'They will ask you for a definitive ruling about women. Say, <I>"Allah givesyou a definitive ruling about them; and also what is recited to you in theBook about orphan girls to whom you do not give the inheritance they areowed, while at the same time desiring to marry them..."'</I> (4:127) AllahAlmighty revealed to them in this <I>ayat</I> that if an orphan girl hadwealthy and beauty, they desired to marry her for her lineage and dower.If she was not desired because of lack of wealth and beauty, they left herand took other women." She said, "As they used to leave her when they didnot desire her, they should not marry her when they desired her unless theywere fair to him and gave her her full right to dower."<P><P><B>XLV</B>. <B>When the suitor says to the guardian, "Marry so-and-so tome," and he says, "I have married her to you for such-and-such," the marriageis allowed, even if he does not say to the husband, "Have you agreed oraccepted?"</B><P><B> </B>4847. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "A woman came to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and offered herself tohim. He said, "I do not have any need for women right now." A man said,"Messenger of Allah, marry her to me!" He asked, "Do you have anything?"He replied, "I do not have anything." He said, "Give something to her, evenif only an iron ring."

It is related that Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Beware of suspicion. Suspicion is thefalsest kind of speech. Do not spy or pry.

I said, 'Amiral-Mu'minin, who are the two wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, about whom Allah says, "<I>If the two of you would turnto Allah, for your hearts clearly deviated</I>"?' He said, 'I am surprisedat your question, Ibn 'Abbas. That was 'A'isha and Hafsa.' Then 'Umar procededto relate the <I>hadith</I>.<P>He said, 'I and a neighbour of mine from the Ansar were among the Banu Umayyaibn Zayd, which is part of the 'Awali area of Madina. We used to take itin turns to visit the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Hewould go one day and I would go the next. When I went, I would bring himthe news of that day of the revelation and other things. When he went, hedid the same. We, the company of Quraysh, used to dominate women, and whenwe came to the Ansar, they were a people who were dominated by their women.So our women began to adopt the manner of the women of the Ansar. Once Ishouted at my wife and she answered me back. I disliked that she should answerme back. She said, "Do you dislike that I should answer you back? By Allah,the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, answerhim back! Some of them might not have anything to do with him for the entireday until night!" That alarmed me, so I said, "The one among them who hasdone this will incur a terrible loss!" Does one of you anger the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the entire day untilnight?" She said, "Yes." I said, "She is ruined and lost! Does she feel securethat Allah will not become angry by the anger of His Messenger, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, so that she will be destroyed? Do not askfrom the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, toomuch and do not answer him back in anything and do not refuse to speak tohim. Ask me what you like. Do not be tempted into being like your neighboursince she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace," meaning 'A'isha.<P>"'We were saying that Ghassan were getting ready their mounts to attack us.Once, on a day when it was his turn, my friend went down.

He said, "No, something worse still and even more serious.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has divorcedhis wives." I said, "Hafsa is ruined and lost!" I used to think that thiswas about to happen. I got dressed and prayed the Fajr prayer with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He entered a small upper room ofhim and withdrew into it. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked,"Why are you weeping? Didn't I warn you? Has the Messenger of Allah divorcedyou all?" She said, "I do not know. He is in his small upper room."<P>"'I went out and went to the minbar, A group of people were around it andsome of them were weeping. I sat with them a short while and then what Ifelt overcame me. I went to the small room where he was and I said to a blackslave of him, "Ask permission for 'Umar." He went in and spoke to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then came out and said, "I mentionedyou to him but he was silent." So I went away and sat with the group whowere at the minbar. Then what I felt overcame me and I went - and he mentionedthe like of it. Then I sat with the group who were at the minbar. Then whatI felt overpowered me and I went to the slave and said, "Ask permission for'Umar," - and he mentioned the like.

There was no beddingbetween him and it and I could see the mark of the mat on his side. He wasreclining on a leather cushion stuffed with palm fibre. I greeted him andthen I asked while I was standing, "Have you divorced your wives?" He lookedup at me and said, "No." Then I said, sociably while I was standing, "Messengerof Allah, will you listen to me? We, the company of Quraysh, used to dominateour women. Then we came to a people whose women dominate them..." (and hementioned it.) The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smiled.Then I said, "Will you listen to me? I visited Hafsa and I said, 'Do notbe tempted into being like your neighbour since she is more beautiful thanyou and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace,'" meaning 'A'isha. He smiled again. I sat down when I saw himsmile. I raised my eyes to look about the room and, by Allah, I did not seeanything of note in it except for three hides. I said, "Ask Allah to enrichyour community. Persia and Byzantium were made rich and were given this worldbut they did not worship Allah." He was reclining and then he said, "Do youhave any doubts, Ibn al-Khattab? Those people were repaid for their goodactions in the life of this world." I said, "Messenger of Allah, ask forgivenessfor me."<P>"'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had withdrawnfor 29 nights because of the story which Hafsa divulged to 'A'isha.
