<P>
<P>
<B>I: The <I>salam</I> in respect of a specified measure</B>
<P>
2124. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to Madina, people used to pay for
fruit one or two years in advance (or he said, "two or three years." Isma'il
was unsure.) He said, 'Whoever pays for dates in advance should only do so
for a specified measure and specified weight."
<P>
This is related from Ibn Abi Najih, "a specified measure and specified weight."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The <I>salam</I> in respect of a specified weight</B>
<P>
2125. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came to Madina, they used to pay for dates two and
three years in advance. He said, 'When anyone pays in advance for something,
it must be for a specified measure and specified weight for a specified term."
<P>
It is related from Ibn Abi Najih, "Advance payment is made for a specified
measure for a specified term."
<P>
2126. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came and said, "a specified measure and a specified
weight for a specified term."
<P>
2127. It is related that Muhammad or 'Abdullah ibn Abi'l-Mujalid said, "'Abdullah
ibn Shaddad ibn al-Hadi and Abu Burda disagreed about advance payment and
they sent me to Ibn Abi Awfa and I asked him about it. He said, 'In the time
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Abu Bakr
and 'Umar, we used to make advance payment for wheat, barley, raisins and
dates.' I also asked Ibn Abza and he said the same as that."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: <I>Salam</I> to someone who has no crop</B>
<P>
2128. It is related that Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Mujalid said, "Abdullah ibn Shaddad
ibn al-Hadi and Abu Burda sent me to 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa and said to me,
'Ask him whether in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, the Companions of the Prophet used to make advance payment for
wheat. 'Abdullah said, 'We used to make advance payments to the peasants
of the people of Syria for wheat, barley and oil for a specified measure
and for a specified time.' I said, 'To the person who possessed the crop?'
He said, 'We did not use to ask about that.' Then they sent me to 'Abdu'r-Rahman
ibn Abza and I asked him and he said, 'The Companions of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to make advance payments in the
time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we did
not ask them whether they had the crops or not.'"
<P>
2129. This is related from Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Mujalid. He said, "We paid
them in advance for wheat and barley."
<P>
It is related from Sufyan that ash-Shaybani said, "And oil."
<P>
It is related from Jarir that ash-Shaybani said, "Wheat, barley and raisins."
<P>
2130. It is related that Abu'l-Bakhtari at-Ta'i said, "I asked Ibn 'Abbas
about <I>salam</I> in respect of palm-trees. He said, 'The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade selling the fruits of the palm until
they were ready to eat and until they were weighed.' A man asked, 'What is
meat by &nbsp;'weighed'?' A man beside him said, 'until they are gathered
in.'"
<P>
The same as that is related from Abu'l-Bakhtari from Ibn 'Abbas; "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade..."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The <I>salam</I> in respect of date-palms</B>
<P>
2131. It is related that Abu'l-Bakhtari said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar about the
<I>salam</I> in respect of palm-trees. He said, 'It was forbidden to sell
the fruits of the palm until they were sound, and to sell silver f[i.e. for
silver] for delayed payment.'"
<P>
I asked Ibn 'Abbas about the <I>salam</I> in respect of palm-trees. He said,
"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade selling the
fruits of the palm until they could be eaten and until they were weighed."
<P>
2132. It is related that Abu'l-Bakhtari said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar about the
<I>salam</I> in respect of palm-trees. He said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, forbade selling the fruit until they were sound
and he forbade selling silver for gold with a delay.'
<P>
"I asked Ibn 'Abbas and he said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, forbade selling the fruits of the palm until they were ready to
eat and until they were weighed.' I said, 'What does it mean 'weighed'?'
A man with him said, 'until they are gathered in.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The guarantor (<I>kafil</I>) in the <I>salam</I></B>
<P>
2133. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, bought some food from a Jew to be paid for
later, and left his iron armour with him as security."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Leaving things as security in the <I>salam</I></B>
<P>
2134. It is related that al-A'mash said, "We were discussing leaving things
as security in cases of advance payment with Ibrahim and he said, 'Al-Aswad
related to me from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, bought some food from a Jew to be paid at a later fixed date,
and left his iron armour with him as security.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The <I>salam</I> for a specified term</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Sa'id, al-Aswad and al-Hasan said it was allowed.
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "There is no harm in a specified food for a specified price
to a specified term as long as it is not crops whose soundness has not yet
appeared."
<P>
2135. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came to Madina, people were paying for things two
and three years in advance. He said, 'Pay in advance for fruits for a specified
measure and a specified term.'"
<P>
It is related from Ibn Abi Najih, "a specified measure and a specified weight."
<P>
2136. It is related that Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Mujalid said, "Abu Burda and
Abdullah ibn Shaddad sent me to 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abza and 'Abdullah ibn
Abi Awfa and I asked them about advance payment and they said, "We used used
to get booty with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and some of the peasants of Syria would come to us and we would pay
them in advance for wheat, barley and raisins for a specified time.' I said,
Did they own the crop or not?' He replied, 'We did not use to ask about that.'
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The <I>salam</I> whose term is when the she-camel gives birth</B>
<P>
2137. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "We used to sell camels in the basis
of &nbsp;<I>habal al-habala</I> and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, forbade it." Nafi' explained that as being concluded when
the she-camel gives birth to what is in its womb.

<B><BIG><A NAME="shufa">Chapter 39. Book of Pre-Emption</A></BIG></B>
<BIG><B>(<I>shuf'a</I>)</B></BIG>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: Pre-emption in respect of what has not been demarcated. When there
are clear boundaries, there is no pre-emption</B>
<P>
2138. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, judged that there was pre-emption
in all undemarcated property. When there were clear boundaries and roads
were clear, then there was no pre-emption."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Offering pre-emption to a partner before selling</B>
<P>
Al-Hakam said, "When he gives him permission before the sale, he has no right
of pre-emption."
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi said, "If something is sold in a situation where a person has
the right of pre-emption, and he witnesses it and does not object, he has
no right of pre-emption."
<P>
2139. It is related that 'Amr ibn ash-Sharik said, "I was standing with Sa'd
ibn Abi Waqqas when al-Miswar ibn Makhrama came and put his hand on my shoulder.
Then Abu Rafi', the client of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, came and said, 'Sa'd! Buy two rooms in your house from me.' Sa'd
said, 'By Allah, I will not buy them.' Al-Miswar said, 'By Allah, you will
buy them!' Sa'd said, 'By Allah, 'I will not pay more than four thousand
in instalments.' Abu Rafi' said, 'I have been offered five hundred dinars
for them. If it were not that I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, say, "A neighbour is more entitled by reason of his proximity,"
I would not give them to you for four thousand. I would sell them for five
hundred dinars.' He sold them to Sa'd."
<P>
<P>
<B>III Which neighbour is considered nearer?</B>
<P>
2140. It is related from 'A'isha, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I have two
neighbours. To which of them should I give?' He replied, 'To the one whose
door is nearer to you.'"

<B><BIG><A NAME="hire">Chapter 40. Book of Hiring</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: Hiring a righteous man </B>
<P>
in accordance with the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"The best person to hire
is someone strong and trustworthy." </I>(28:26)
<P>
<B>A trustworthy custodian and someone not giving a post to person overly
eager for it</B>
<P>
2141. It is related from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "A trustworthy custodian who carries
out what he is ordered to do cheerfully is one of those who give
<I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
2142. It is related that Abu Musa said, "I came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, with two men of the Ash'ari tribe. I said,
'I did not know that they were seeking posts.' He said, 'We will not appoint
to our posts any who seek them.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Herding sheep for money (qirats)</B>
<P>
2143. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Allah did not send any Prophet but that he herded
sheep." His Companions said, "Including you?" He said, "Yes, I used to herd
them for money (<I>qirats</I>) for the people of Makka."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Hiring idolaters in case of necessity or if there are no Muslims
available</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, hired Jews at Khaybar.
<P>
2144. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr hired a man of the Banu ad-Dil from the
Banu 'Abd ibn 'Adi as an expert guide, (<I>khirrit</I> means expert guide.)
He had taken an oath of alliance with the family of al-'As ibn Wa'il and
followed the religion of the unbelievers of Quraysh. They both trusted him
and gave him their mounts and arranged with him to meet them at the cave
of Thawr after three nights. He brought them their mounts on the morning
of the third day whereupon they set off. 'Amir ibn Fuhayra and the Dili guide
went with them. He took them below Makka on the coastal route."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: It is permitted for someone to hire another to work for him after
three days or a month or part of a year, both parties should carry out the
conditions they have stipulated</B> <B>when the stipulated time comes</B>
<P>
2145. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr hired a man of the
Banu ad-Dil as an expert guide even though he followed the religion of the
unbelievers of Quraysh. They gave him their mounts and they arranged to meet
him at the cave of Thawr after three nights and he brought them their mounts
on the morning of the third day."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Hired men on expeditions</B>
<P>
2146. It is related that Ya'la ibn Umayya said, "I went on the expedition
of the Army of Hardship (Tabuk) with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace. I think that was one my best deeds. An employee of mine
fought with a man and one of them close his teeth on the other's finger and
when he pulled out his finger the other's tooth fell out. He went to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who denied his claim for
compensation for the tooth, saying, 'Would you rather he had left his finger
in your mouth so that you could gnaw on it (he said, 'I think he said, '
as a stallion gnaws')."
<P>
A similar story to this is related from the grandfather of 'Abdullah ibn
Abi Mulayka - a man bit another man's hand and his tooth fell out and Abu
Bakr denied the claim.
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: When someone is hired and the period of employment is made clear to
him but not the work, with reference to the words of Allah, <I>"I would like
to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine </I>...to His
words..<I>.Allah is Guardian over what we say." </I>(28:27-28)</B>
<P>
To hire someone means to give him a wage. Part of it is what is said in
consolation, "May Allah repay you!"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: It is permitted to hire someone to shore up a wall that is about
to fall down</B>
<P>
2147. It is related from Ubayy ibn Ka'b that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, They found there a wall on the
point of falling down. (Sa'id said, "With his hand like this" and raised
his hand and put it upright.)" Ya'la said, "I think that Sa'id said, 'He
touched it with his hand and put it upright.' He said, 'If you had wished,
surely you could have exacted some recompense for it.'" Sa'id said, "A wage
that we can eat with."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Hiring people up to the time of midday</B>
<P>
2148. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Your example and the example of the People of
the Two Books is like that of a man who hired some employees and said, 'Who
will work for me from morning to midday for a qirat?' So the Jews worked.
Then he said, 'Who will work for me from midday to the <I>'Asr </I>prayer
for a qirat?' So the Christians worked. Then he said, 'Who will work for
me from <I>'Asr</I> until sunset for two qirats?' You are they. The Jews
and Christians became angry and said, 'Why do we have more work and less
wages?' He said, 'Have I given you less than what was due to you?' They said,
'No.' He said, 'That is my bounty which I give to whomever I wish.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Hiring until the time o<I>f 'Asr</I> prayer</B>
<P>
2149. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar ibn al-Khattab that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The example of
you, the Jews and the Christians is like that of a man who employed some
workers. He said, 'Who will work for me until midday for a qirat each?' The
Jews worked for a qirat each. Then the Christians worked for a qirat each.
Then you are those who work from the <I>'Asr </I>prayer to sunset for two
qirats each. The Jews and Christians got angry and said, 'We did more work
but get less pay!' He said, 'Have I wronged you at all regarding anything
which was due to you?' They said, 'No.' He said, 'That is my bounty which
I give to whomever I wish.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The sin of someone who withholds the wages of an employee</B>
<P>
2150. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty says, 'I will be an adversary
against three people on the Day of Rising: a man who makes an agreement in
My name and then betrays it, a man who sells a free man and consumes the
proceeds, and a man who hires an employee and gets full work from him and
then does not pay him his wages.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Hiring from the time of <I>'Asr</I> till nightfall</B>
<P>
2151. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "The example of the Muslims, Jews and Christians is
like that of a man who hires some people to work for him for a day until
nightfall for a specified wage. They work until midday and say, 'We do not
need the wage you stipulated for us and let the work we have done be discounted.'
He says to them, 'Do not do that. Finish the rest of your work and take your
wage in full.' They refuse and leave. He hires two workers after them and
says to them, 'Finish the rest of this day and you will have the wage I
stipulated for them.' They work until the time of the<I> 'Asr </I>prayer
and say, 'Let our work be discounted and you keep the wage which you stipulated
for us for doing it.' He says, 'Finish the rest of your work. There is only
a little of the day left.' They refuse. He hires some more people to work
for him for the rest of the day and they work for the rest of the day until
the sun sets and they take the full wage of both of the other two groups.
That is their example and the example of their non-acceptance of this light."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Someone who hires another who neglects to take his wage and then
the employer uses that money and it increases, or someone who uses someone
else's money which increases</B>
<P>
2152. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that he heard the Messenger
of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Three men among
those before you were out walking. When night fell they took refuge in a
cave and entered it and a rock fell down from the mountain and blocked their
way out of the cave. They said, 'You will not be delivered from this rock
unless you make supplication to Allah by your virtuous actions!' One of them
said, 'O Allah, I have two aged parents and I used not to give any milk in
the evening to my family or friends before them. One evening I went a long
way to get something and did not reach them until after they had gone to
sleep. I milked their evening drink for them and then found them asleep.
I did not want to give my family or friends their evening drink before them
so I remained with the cup in my hand waiting for them to wake up until dawn
came. Then they woke up and drank their drink. O Allah, if I did that out
of the desire for Your pleasure, then release us from this situation we are
in in respect of this rock.' A little gap opened but they still could not
get out."
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Another said,
'O Allah! A niece of mine used to be the person I loved more than anyone
else. I tried to seduce her and she refused me until one year she was suffering
on account of a drought. She came to me and I gave her a hundred and twenty
dinars provided that she would give me a free hand with herself. She did
that until I was about to have her and she said, "It is not lawful for you
to deflower without marriage." I gave up the idea of sexual intercourse with
her and left her even though she was the person I loved more than any other.
However, I still left the gold I had given her. O Allah, if I did that out
of the desire for Your pleasure, then release us from the situation we are
in!' The rock opened further but not enough to enable them to leave."
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The third one
said, 'O Allah, I employed workers and gave them their wages except for one
man who left what he was owed and went off. I invested his wage and the wealth
from it multiplied. He came to me after a time and said, "'Abdullah, pay
me my wage!" I said, "All the camels, cattle, sheep and slaves that you see
here have come from your wage." He said, "'Abdullah, are you making fun of
me?" I said, "No, I am not making fun of you." He took all of them and drove
them off not leaving anything. O Allah, if I did that out of the desire for
Your pleasure, then release us from the situation we are in!' The stone moved
out of the way and they walked out."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Someone who lets himself be hired to carry things on his back and
then gives his wage away as <I>sadaqa</I>, and the wages of porters</B>
<P>
2153. It is related that Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari said, "When the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded us to give
<I>sadaqa</I>, we used to go to the market and carry things and get a
<I>mudd</I>. Some of us now have a hundred thousand." Shaqiq said, "We think
he meant himself."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: The wage of the broker</B>
<P>
Ibn Sirin, 'Ata'. Ibrahim and al-Hasan did not think that there was any harm
in a broker reveiving a wage.
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "There is no harm in someone saying, 'Sell this garment
and whatever is more than such-and-such is yours.'"
<P>
Ibn Sirin said, "There is no harm in someone saying, 'Sell it for such-and-such
and whatever profit there is belongs to you, or should be shared between
you and me.'"
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Muslims abide
by their conditions."
<P>
2154. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, forbade going out to meet carvans and that a townsman sell
on behalf of men of the desert." Tawus said, "I asked, 'Ibn 'Abbas, what
is meant by his words, "What does he means by 'townsmen should not sell on
behalf of men of the desert'?" He said, "They should not act as his broker."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Is a Muslim permitted to hire himself to an idolater in the Land of
War?</B>
<P>
2155. It is related that Khabbab said, "I used to be a blacksmith and I did
some work for al-'As ibn Wa'il. He owed me some money, so I went to him to
ask for it. He said, 'By Allah, I will not pay it to you until you reject
Muhammad.' I said,, 'By Allah, not until you die and are resurrected from
the dead.' He said, 'So I will die and be resurrected?' I said, 'Yes.' He
said, 'So then I will be given wealth and children and I will pay you.' So
Allah Almighty revealed, <I>'Have you seen him who rejects Our Signs and
says, "I will certainly be given wealth and children there"?' </I>(19:77))"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: What is paid for making incantation with the <I>Fatiha</I> of the
Book over Arab tribes</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"That for which a man is most entitled to take a wage is the Book of Allah."
<P>
Ash-Sha'bi said, "A teacher should not stipulate any wage, but if he is given
something, he should accept it." Al-Hakam said, "I did not hear of anyone
disliking paying teachers a wage." Al-Hasan paid ten dirhams and Ibn Sirin
did not see any harm in a wage being given to official distributors." He
said, "It was said that <I>suht</I> (ill-gotten gains) refers to bribes given
to secure favourable judgements. People used to be paid for estimating."
<P>
2156. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "A group of the Companions of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on a journey and halted
near one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused
to give them any. The chief of that tribe was bitten or stung [by a snake
or scorpion] and they tried everything, but nothing helped. One of them said,
'If you were to go to those people who camped, perhaps one of them has
something.' So they went to them and said, 'Our chief has been stung and
we have tried everything but nothing has helped him. Does any of you have
anything [which will help]?' One of them said, 'Yes, by Allah. I can recite
an incantation, but, by Allah, we asked you for hospitality and you did not
give it to us. I will not recite it for you until you stipulate a payment
for us.' They agreed to pay them a certain number of sheep. He spat on it
and recited, 'Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds.'
It was as if the chief was released from a hobble and he began to walk and
there was nothing wrong with him. He said, 'Pay them their wage which you
agreed with them.' One of the [Muslims] said, 'Divide it up.' The one who
had recited said, 'Do not do it until we reach the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. We will tell him what happened and see what he commands
us.' They went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and mentioned it to him. He said, 'How did you know that it is an
incantation?' Then he said, 'You were right. Divide and give me a share as
well.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughed."
<P>
It is related that Abu Bishr heard Abu'l-Mutawakkil relate this.
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: The levy on a slave and the paying of the levies of a slavegirl</B>
<P>
2157. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "Abu Tayyiba cupped the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he commanded a <I>sa'</I> or
two<I> sa'</I>s of food to be given to him and told his owners to reduce
his levy or tax."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: The levy of the cupper</B>
<P>
2158. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was cupped and paid the cupper."
<P>
2159. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was cupped and paid the cupper his wage. If he knew
it was disliked, he would not have paid him."
<P>
2160. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was cupped and never withheld anyone's wages."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Someone telling the owners of a slave to lessen his levy</B>
<P>
2161. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, called for a slave who was a cupper and he cupped
him and he commanded a <I>sa' </I>or two<I> sa'</I>s or a <I>mudd</I> or
two <I>mudds</I> to be given to him and spoke [to his owners] about him to
reduce his levy."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: Earnings from prostition and slavegirls</B>
<P>
Ibrahim disliked the wages of the wailer and the singing-girl.
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Do not force your slavegirls to prostitute
themselves if they desire to be virtuous women out of your desire for the
goods of this world. If anyone forces them, after they have been forced,
Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (</I>24:33) "<I>Fatayatikum</I>
means your slavegirls."
<P>
2162. It is related from Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade the proceeds from the sale
of dogs, money earned through prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer."
<P>
2163. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, forbade the earnings of slavegirls."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: The semen of male camels</B>
<P>
2164. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, forbade selling the semen of the male camel."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: When someone rents land and then &nbsp;he or the owner dies</B>
<P>
Ibn Sirin said, "His family cannot evict him until the end of the lease."
<P>
Al-Hakam, al-Hasan and Iyas ibn Mu'awiya said, "The lease lasts its term."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rented
out Khaybar for half its yield. That was in the time of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr and the beginning of the
khalifate of 'Umar." He did not mention that Abu Bakr and 'Umar renewed the
rent after the death of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
2165. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rented Khaybar to the Jews to work
it and cultivate it on the basis that they would have half of what it produced."
'Umar related that the fields were rented for something [of the yield]. "Nafi'
specified it but I do not remember what it was." Rafi' ibn Khadij said, "The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade renting out fields."
<P>
'Ubaydullah related from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar, "until 'Umar expelled them."

<P>
<P>
<B>I: On transferring a debt and whether it can be retracted</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan and Qatada said, "If someone possessed wealth on the day it [a debt]
was transferred to him, the transfer is permitted." Ibn 'Abbas said, "When
two partners or heirs break up, and one of them takes assets and the other
takes debts which prove to be uncollectable for him, the latter has no claim
against the former."
<P>
2166. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Procrastination on the part of a rich man is
injustice. If the debt of one of you is transferred to a rich man, it should
be allowed to take place."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: When the debt of a dead person is transferred to another man, that
is permitted. When it is transferred to a rich man, it is irrevocable</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw11.html#84">2167</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Procrastination
on the part of a rich man is injustice. If the debt of one of you is transferred
to a rich man, it should be allowed to take place."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: It is permitted for the debts of a dead person to be transferred
to someone else </B>
<P>
2168. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "One day we were sitting
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a dead man
was brought for burial. They said, 'Pray over him.' He said, 'Has he any
debts?' They answered, 'No.' He asked, 'Has he left anything?' They said,
'No,' so he prayed over him. Then another dead man was brought for burial
and they said, 'Messenger of Allah, pray over him.' He asked, 'Has he any
debts?' It was said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Has he left anything?' They replied,
'Three dinars.' He prayed over him. Then a third was brought and they said,
'Pray over him.' He asked, 'Has he left anything?' They answered, 'No.' He
asked, 'Has he any debts?' They said, 'Three dinars.' He said, 'Pray over
your companion.' Abu Qatada said, 'Messenger of Allah, pray over him and
I will pay his debt.' So he prayed over him."

<P>
<B>I: When people or other things are taken as surety for loans or debts
</B>
<P>
Muhammad ibn Hamza ibn 'Amr al-Aslami said from his father that 'Umar sent
him to collect <I>zakat</I>. A man had had intercourse with his wife's slavegirl
and Hamza took sureties from the man to ensure that he came to 'Umar. 'Umar
gave him a hundred lashes. 'Umar confirmed their story and excused the man
because of his ignorance.
<P>
Jarir and al-Ash'ath said to 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud about the apostates, "Ask
them to repent and take sureties from them." They repented and their tribe
was their surety. Hammad said, "When a person stands as surety for someone
else who dies, he is absolved from his undertaking." Al-Hakam said, "He remains
as a guarantee."
<P>
2169. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, mentioned that a man of the tribe of Isra'il
asked another of the tribe of Isra'il to lend him a thousand dinars. He said,
"Bring me witnesses so I can have testimony." He said, "Allah is enough as
a witness." He said, "Bring me a surety." He said, "Allah is enough as a
surety." He said, "You have spoken the truth," and he lent it to him for
a fixed term. The man set out over the sea and accomplished what he wanted.
Then he looked for a boat in which he could sail so as to arrive back to
meet the deadline he had set, but could find none. So he took a piece of
wood, bored a hole in it, put the thousand dinars and a note from himself
to his friend inside it, closed up the hole and took it down to the sea.
He said, "O Allah, You know that I borrowed a thousand dinars from so-and-so
and he asked me for a surety and I said, 'Allah is enough as a surety,' and
he was satisfied with You. He asked me for a witness and I said, 'Allah is
enough as a witness' and he was satisfied with You. I have tried to find
a boat to send him what he is owed, but I have not been able to find one.
Therefore, I have entrusted it to You." He threw it into the sea until it
disappeared into the distance. Then he left and began to look for a ship
to return to his country. The man who had lent the money to him went out
looking to see if a ship had come with it and lo and behold there was the
piece of wood containing the money. He took it to use as firewood for his
family. When he sawed it up, he discovered the money and the note. Then the
one who had borrowed it arrived, bringing another thousand dinars. He said,
"By Allah, I tried to find a boat to bring you your money but found none
before the one I came in. He said, "Did you send me something?" He said,
"I tell you that I found no ship before the one I came in." He said, "Allah
has delivered for you that which you sent in the wood, so go in right guidance
together with your thousand dinars."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"If you have a bond with people, give
them their share." </I>(4:33)</B>
<P>
2170. It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr that Ibn 'Abbas said about, <I>"We
have appointed heirs&nbsp;(mawali) for everything" </I>that <I>mawali</I>
are heirs. He said about <I>"Those with whom you have a bond,"</I> "When
the Muhajirun came to Madina, a Muhajir would inherit from an Ansari, rather
than his own relatives, because of the brotherhood which the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had established between them. When it
was revealed, '<I>We have appointed heirs&nbsp;(mawali) for everything</I>,'
this practice was abrogated." Then he said, "<I>Those with whom you have
a bond,'</I> referred only to help, co-operation and good advice. Inheritance
was abolished but it was permitted to leave them legacies."
<P>
2171. It is related that Anas said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf came to us and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, established
a bond of brotherhood between him and Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'."
<P>
2172. It is related that 'Asim said, "I said to Anas, 'Have you heard that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no
<I>hilf</I> alliance in Islam"?' He replied, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, made a <I>hilf</I> alliance between Quraysh and
the Ansar in my house.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Someone who makes himself a surety for the debts of a dead person
cannot renege on that</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said that.
<P>
2173. It is related from Salama ibn al-Akwa' that a dead man was brought
for burial to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for him
to pray over and he asked, "Has he any debts?" They answerted, "No," and
he prayed over him. Then he was brought another man for burial and he asked,
"Has he any debts?" They said, "Yes," and he said, "Pray over your companion."
Abu Qatada said, "I will take on his debt, Messenger of Allah." So he prayed
over him.
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#51">2174</A>. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said,
"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If the money
from Bahrayn comes, I will give you such-and-such.' The money from Bahrayn
did not come until after the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
had died. When the money of Bahrayn arrived, Abu Bakr commanded that it be
announced, 'Whoever has a promise from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, or a debt should come to us.' I came to him and said, 'The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told me such-and-such.'
He gave me a double handful and I counted them and there were five hundred.
He said, 'Take twice as much again.'"
<P>
[This was the <I>jizya</I> tax.]
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The protection and promise granted to Abu Bakr during the time of
the Prophet</B>
<P>
2175. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "I only
remember my parents following the <I>deen</I>."
<P>
It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "I only remember
my parents following the <I>deen</I>. Not a day passed by without the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, coming to us at the two
ends of the day, morning and evening. When the Muslims were being persecuted,
Abu Bakr departed for Abyssinia as an emigrant until he reached Bark al-Ghimad
where he met Ibn ad-Daghina. the chief of the al-Qara tribe. He asked, 'Where
are you going, Abu Bakr?' Abu Bakr replied, 'My people have driven me out.
I am intending to travel in the earth and to worship my Lord.' Ibn ad-Daghina
said, 'Someone like you should not leave nor be driven out. You help the
poor, maintain your ties of kinship, give surety for orphans, give hospitality
to guests and help people in times of trouble. I am your protector, so return
and worship your Lord in your own land.' Ibn ad-Daghina travelled and returned
with Abu Bakr and went around to the nobles of the unbelievers of Quraysh
and said to them, 'Someone like Abu Bakr should not leave nor be expelled.
Will you expel a man who helps the poor, maintains ties of kinship, gives
surety for orphans, gives hospitality to guests and helps people in times
of trouble?' Quraysh allowed the protection of Ibn ad-Daghina and gave security
to Abu Bakr. They said to Ibn ad-Daghina, 'Tell Abu Bakr to worship his Lord
in his house and to pray and recite as he likes but not to bother us with
it, and he should not make it public. We fear that he will seduce our sons
and women.' Ibn ad-Daghina told that to Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr began to worship
his Lord in his house and not to do the prayer publicly or recite outside
of his house. Then it occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in the courtyard
of his house and he began to pray in it and recite Qur'an, and the women
and sons of the idolaters crowded around, admiring and looking at it. Abu
Bakr was a man prone to weeping and he could not hold back his tears when
he recited Qur'an. That alarmed the nobles of Quraysh who were idolaters
and they sent to Ibn ad-Daghina who came to them. They said to him, 'We gave
protection to Abu Bakr on condition that he would worship his Lord in his
house and he has exceeded that and built a mosque in the courtyard of his
house and has done the prayer and recitation publicly. We are afraid that
he will seduce our sons and women. Go to him. If he wants to confine himself
to worshipping his Lord in his house, he should do it. If he refuses not
to do it in public, then ask him to return your pledge of protection to you.
We dislike to break your pledge but we will not allow Abu Bakr to worship
in public.'"
<P>
'A'isha said, "Ibn ad-Daghina went to Abu Bakr and said, 'You know the basis
on which I gave you the pledge of protection. Either confine yourself to
that or return my pledge to me. I do not want to hear the Arabs say that
I broke my pledge to a man to whom I had given it.' Abu Bakr said, 'I return
your protection to you. I am satisfied with the protection of Allah.' At
that time the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was still in Makka. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'I have been shown your place of emigration. I saw salty
land with palm-trees between two lava-fields.' When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,mentioned that, some people emigrated
to Madina and some of those who had emigrated to the land of Abyssinia returned
from there to Madina. Abu Bakr prepared to emigrate and the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'Take your time.
I hope to be given permission.' Abu Bakr said, 'My father be your ransom,
do you hope for that?' He said, 'Yes.' Therefore Abu Bakr kept himself back
to accompany the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
He fed two riding-camels he had on acacia leaves for four months."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Debts</B>
<P>
2176. It is related from Abu Hurayra that when a dead man with debts was
brought to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
he used to ask, "Has he left any surplus to pay his debts with?" If he was
told that he had left enough to pay his debts, he would do the prayer over
him. Otherwise he told the Muslims, "Pray over your companion." When Allah
granted him victories, he said, "I have more right to be the protector of
the believers than themselves. If any believer dies leaving a debt, I will
pay it. If anyone leaves property, it goes to his heirs."

<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave 'Ali authorisation
in respect of his sacrificial animals and then commanded him to distribute
them.
<P>
2177. It is related that 'Ali said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless

and skins of the camels which had been sacrificed."
<P>
2178. It is related from 'Uqba ibn 'Amir that the Prophet, may Allah bless

A lamb remained over and he mentioned it to the Prophet, may Allah bless

<P>
<P>
<B>II: It is permitted for a Muslim to give authority to a <I>harbi</I> in
the Abode of War or in the Land of Islam </B>
<P>
2179. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf said, "I wrote a document
in conjunction with Umayya ibn Khalaf that he would protect my property in
Makka and I would protect his property in Madina. When I mentioned "ar-Rahman",
he said, 'I do not recognise "ar-Rahman". Write it for me in the name you
used to have in the time of <I>Jahiliyya</I>.' So I wrote: ''Abdu 'Amr.'
On the day of Badr, I went up the mountainside to give him protection when
the people were asleep. Bilal saw him and went up to the group of the Ansar
and said, 'There is Umayya ibn Khalaf! I would rather die than see Umayya
saved!' A group of the Ansar went out with him after us. When I feared they
were catching up with us, I left his son behind with them in order to distract
them but they killed him. Then they insisted on coming after us. He was a
large man and when they came up to us, I said to him, 'Kneel down' and he
knelt down and I laid myself on top of him to protect him but they got their
swords through under me until they had killed him. One of them hit my foot
with his sword." He said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf used to show us that mark
on the back of his foot."
<P>

<B>III: Authorisation in respect of money-changing and weighing</B>
<P>
'Umar and Ibn 'Umar used to authorise others in money-changing transactions
<P>
2180. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, appointed a man as an
agent in Khaybar who brought them some dates of a really excellent kind.
He said, "Are all the dates of Khaybar like this?" He said, "We take one
<I>sa'</I> of this kind for two <I>sa's </I>and two <I>sa' </I>for three
<I>sa'</I>s." He said, "Do not do that. Sell the worse ones for dirhams and

weighing.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: If a shepherd or a deputy sees a sheep dying, or something going bad,

2181. It is related from Ibn Ka'b ibn Malik from his father that they had
some sheep which grazed at Sal'. He said, "One of our slavegirls saw one
of our sheep dying. She split a stone and slaughtered it with it. My father
said to them, 'Do not eat until I ask the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, (or 'I will send someone to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, to ask him') and he asked the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, about that (or he sent a message) and he
instructed him to eat."

'Ubaydullah said, "I appreciated the fact that although she was a slavegirl
she had slaughtered."

'Abda corroborated it from 'Ubaydullah.

<B>V: It is permitted to authorise someone whether he is present or absent</B>
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Amr wrote to his deputy who was absent to pay <I>zakat</I>
on behalf of his family, both young and old.
<P>
2182. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, owed a man a camel of a certain age and he came
to him to ask for it. He said, 'Give it to him.' They looked for one of that
age, but only found one which was older. He said, 'Give it to him.' He said,
'You have given me full payment. May Allah give you full payment!' The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The best of you is he who
is most generous in settlement.'"
<P>

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to pay his debts and spoke coarsely.
His Companions wanted to attack him but the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Leave him alone. The one with a right
can speak.' Then he said, 'Give him one the right age for the one he is owed.'
They said, "Messenger of Allah, we can only find an older, more valuable
one.' He said, 'Give to him. The best of you is he who is most generous in
settlement."

<B>VII: It is permitted to give something to a deputy or a people's mediator,
going by the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
to the delegation of Hawazin when they asked him for booty and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "My share is yours."</B>
<P>
2184. It is related from Marwan ibn al-Hakam and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama that
when the delegation of Hawazin came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, as Muslims, he stood up. They asked him to
restore to them their property and their people who had been captured. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to them,
'The statement I love the most is the one which is most sincere. Choose one
of the two - either the captives or the property. I have delayed distributing
them.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
waited for them for about ten days after returning from Ta'if. When it was
apparent to them that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, would only return one of the two to them, they said, 'We will
take the captives.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, got up among the Muslims and praised Allah as He deserves and
then said, 'Following on from that: these brothers of yours have come in
repentance and I think that the captives should be returned to them. Any
of you who are happy with this should do that. Any of you who want to keep
their share until we can pay him from the first spoils which Allah brings
us may do that. The people said, 'We are happy to do that in their case for
the sake of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'We
do not know which of you have allowed it and which have not. Go back so that
your leaders can inform us of your decision.' The people went back and their
leaders spoke to them and then they returned to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told him, 'They are happy with that
and give their permission.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: If one man authorises another to give something without making it
clear how much, he should give according to what is common practice among
the people</B>
<P>
2185. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I was on a journey with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and I was on a slow
camel which was right at the rear. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, passed by me and said, 'Who is this?' I said, 'Jabir ibn 'Abdullah.'
He said, 'What is wrong with you?' I said, 'I am on a slow camel.' He said,
'Do you have a stick with you?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Give it to me.'
I gave it to him and he hit the camel and chided it. It went from that place
right up to the front. He said, 'Sell it to me.' I said, 'No, it is yours,
Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Sell it to me. I will buy it for four dinars
and you can ride it to Madina.' When we drew near to Madina, I began to ride
off. He said, 'Where are you going?' I said, 'I have married a woman who
is a widow.' He said, 'Why not a virgin with whom you could sport and who
could sport with you?' I said, 'My father died and left daughters, so I wanted
to marry a woman with experience who was a widow.' He said, 'That's good.'
When we arrived in Madina, he said, 'Bilal, pay him and give him extra.'
He gave him four dinars and added a qirat to it." Jabir said, "That extra
qirat from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
has never left me." The qirat did not leave the pocket of Jabir ibn 'Abdullah.
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: A woman giving the ruler authority in respect of her marriage</B>
<P>
2186. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "A woman came to the Messenger

Allah, I have given myself to you (to dispose of in marriage).' A man said,
'Marry her to me.' He said, 'We marry her to you for what you know of the
Qur'an.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: If someone authorises another and the authorised person hands over
something, and the authoriser allows that, it is permitted. It is also permitted
for him to lend for a specified period</B>
<P>
2187. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, put me in charge of guarding the <I>zakat</I>
of Ramadan. Someone came to me and began to take handfuls of food. I grabbed
him and said, 'By Allah, I will take you to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace!' He said, 'I am needy and have a large family
and I am in dire need.'" He said, "I let him go and in the morning the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Abu Hurayra, what did you
do with your prisoner yesterday?'" He said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah,
he complained of dire need and a large family, so I showed mercy to him and
let him go on his way.' He said, 'He lied to you and he will come back.'
So, from the words of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, 'he will come back.', I knew that he would come back. Therefore,
I lay in wait for him and he came and once more began to take handfuls of
food. I seized him and said, 'I will take you to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace!' He said, 'Let me go. I am in need
and have a large family. I will not come back again.' I had mercy on him
and let him go his way. In the morning the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'Abu Hurayra, what did you do
with your prisoner yesterday?' I said, 'Messenger of Allah, he complained
of dire need and a large family, so I showed mercy to him and let him go
on his way.' He said, 'He lied to you and he will come back.' So I lay in
wait for him a third time and he came and began to take handfuls of food.
I grabbed him and said, 'I will take you to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace! This is the third time. You claimed you would
not come back and then you came back.' He said, 'Let me go. I will teach
you some words which will help you with Allah.' I said, 'What are they?'
He said, 'When you go to bed, recite the Throne Verse, <I>"Allah, there is
no god but Him, the Living, the Self-Sustaining..."</I> to the end of the
<I>ayat</I>. You will have someone guarding over you from Allah and shaytan
will not come near you until morning.' So I let him go his way. In the morning,
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to
me, 'What did you do with your prisoner yesterday?' I said, 'Messenger of
Allah, he claimed that he would teach me some words which would help me with
Allah, so I let him go his way.' He said, 'What are they?' I said, 'He said
to me, "When you go to bed, recite the Throne Verse to the end: <I>'Allah,
there is no god but Him, the Living, the Self-Sustaining'."</I> He said to
me, "You will have someone guarding over you from Allah and shaytan will
not come near you until morning."' (They were exceedingly eager for good.)
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "He told you
the truth even though he is a liar. Do you know whom you were speaking with
on these three days, Abu Hurayra?'" He said, "No." The Prophet said, "It
was Shaytan."

2188. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "Bilal brought some Barni
dates to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'Where did you get
these from?' Bilal said, 'We had some bad dates and I sold two <I>sa's</I>
of them for one<I> sa' </I>so that we could feed the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, then said, 'Oh! Oh! Usury itself! Usury itself! Do not do it. If you
want to buy, then sell the dates in a seperate sale and then buy the (other
dates).'"

<P>
<B>XII: Authorisation in respect of a <I>waqf</I> and its administration.
The administrator may feed his friends and eat reasonably</B>
<P>
2189. It is related that 'Amr said about the <I>sadaqa</I> (i.e. <I>waqf</I>)
of 'Umar, "It is no sin for the trustee to eat and give to eat so long as
there is no gain of wealth. Ibn 'Umar was in charge of the <I>sadaqa</I>
of 'Umar. He used to give some of it to people he stayed with in Makka."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Authorisation in respect of the <I>hudud</I> punishments</B>
<P>
2190. It is related from Zayd ibn Khalid and Abu Hurayra that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Unays, go to the wife of
this man and if she confesses, then stone her."
<P>
2191. It is related that 'Uqba ibn al-Harith said, "An-Nu'ayman or the son
of an-Nu'ayman was brought in a state of drunkeness, and the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded those in the house
to beat him." He said, "I was one of those who beat him. We beat him with
sandals and palm fronds."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Authorisation in respect of sacrifical camels and looking after
them</B>
<P>
2192. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I plaited the garlands of the sacrificial
animals of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
with my own hands and then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, hung them round their necks with his own hands and then
sent them with my father. Nothing was unlawful for the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which Allah made lawful for him
during the time until the sacrifice was made."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: When a man says to his authorised deputy, "Place it where Allah shows
you," and the deputy says, "I have heard what you said."</B>
<P>
2193. It is related from Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha that he heard
Anas ibn Malik say, "Abu Talha had more property than any of the Ansar in
Madina. His favourite property was Bayruha' which was opposite the mosque.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
enter that property and drink its sweet water. When this <I>ayat</I> was
sent down: <I>'You will not attain true goodness until you give of what you
love,' </I>(3:93) Abu Talha went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allah Almighty says
in His Book,<I> "You will not attain true goodness until you give of what
you love." </I>The property I love the best is Bayruha'. It is <I>sadaqa</I>
for Allah whose kindness I hope for, and I hope that it will be stored up
for me with Allah. Messenger of Allah, dispose of it in whatever way Allah
shows you is best.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Excellent! That is a profitable property. That is a profitable
property. I have heard what you have said about it and I think that you should
give it to your relatives.' Abu Talha said, 'I will do that, Messenger of
Allah!' So Abu Talha divided it up among his relatives and cousins."
<P>
Rawh corroborated it. Malik said "<I>rabih</I>" (rather than <I>ra'ih</I>).
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: A trustworthy person being given authority in respect of the treasury
and similar things</B>
<P>
2194. It is related from Abu Musa that Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "A trustworthy treasurer, who pays (or he might have said,
"gives") what he is commanded to, completely, fully and cheerfully to the
one to whom he is commanded to give it, is one of two givers of
<I>sadaqa</I>."
