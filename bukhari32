4448. Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I said to Ibn 'Abbas, 'Nawf al-Bikali claims
that this Musa was not the Musa of the Banu Isra'il.' He replied, 'The enemy
of Allah has lied.'
<p>
"Ubayy ibn Ka'b narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Musa stood up to give a speech among the
Banu Isra'il and he was asked, 'Who has the most knowledge?' He replied,
'I have.' Allah censured him since he did not ascribe this knowledge to Him.
Allah revealed to him, 'There is one of Our slaves at the meeting of the
two seas who knows more than you." Musa said, 'My Lord, how can I meet him?'
He was told, 'Take a fish and put it in a basket. When you lose the fish,
that is the place.' So he put a fish in a basket and then set out with his
lad Yusha' ibn Nun, until they reached a rock. They put their heads on it
and went to sleep. The fish moved in the basket and got out of it and fell
into the sea and then made its way into sea, burrowing. Allah held back the
flow of the water and so it was like a tunnel.
<p>
"When Musa woke up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish. They
continued on for the rest of the day and the night. In the morning, Musa
said to his lad,<i> 'Bring us our morning meal. This journey of ours has
made us very tired.' </i>Musa did not feel tired until he had gone beyond
the place about which Allah had commanded him. The lad said to him, <i>'Do
you see what has happened? When we went to find shelter at the rock, I forgot
the fish. No one made me forget to remember it except Shaytan. It found its
way into the sea in an amazing way.'</i>
<p>
"Musa said, <i>'This is the very thing that we were looking for!' So, following
their footsteps, they retraced their route. </i>When they reached the rock,
there was a man wrapped in a garment. Musa greeted him, Al-Khadir said, 'Is
there the greeting in your land?' He replied, 'I am Musa.' He asked, 'The
Musa of the Banu Isra'il?' Musa said, 'Yes. <i>May I follow you on condition
that you teach me some of the right guidance which you have been taught?'
</i>He replied<i>, 'You will not be able to bear with me. </i>Musa, I have
a knowledge from the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me which you
do not know and you have a knowledge He has taught you which I do not know.'
Musa said, <i>'You will find me patient, if Allah wills, and I will not disobey
you in any matter.' </i>Al-Khidr said to him,<i> 'Then if you follow me,
do not question me about anything till I myself make mention of it to you.'</i>
<p>
"They continued walking along the shore. A boat passed by them and they asked
them to take them on board. They recognised al-Khadir and they took them
on board for free. While they were riding in the boat, al-Khadir suddenly
went to one of the planks of the ship and pulled it up with an adze. Musa
said to him, 'Some people carry us for free and then you deliberately <i>stave
it in so that its owners will be drowned? It is truly a dreadful thing that
you have done!'</i> He said,<i> 'Did I not say that you would not be able
to bear with me?' </i>Musa said<i>, 'Do not take me to task because I forgot.
Do not demand of me something too difficult.'" </i>
<p>
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "So
the first excuse of Musa was forgetfulness. He said, "A sparrow came and
alighted on the edge of the ship and dipped its beak once or twice in the
sea. Al-Khadir said to him, 'My knowledge and your knowledge have not diminished
the knowledge of Allah any more than the pecking of this sparrow in the sea
has diminished this sea.'
<p>
"Then they left the ship and continued along the shore. Al-Khadir saw a boy
playing with some other boys. Al-Khadir took of him by the head and wrenched
his neck out and killed him. Musa said to him, <i>'Have you killed a boy
who has done no wrong, without it being in retaliation for someone else?
It is truly an appalling thing that you have done!" He said, "Did I not say
to you that you would not be able to bear with me?" </i>He said that this
was stronger than the first. Then he said, <i>"'If I ask you about anything
after this, then you should no longer keep me company. You will have had
excuse enough from me.'</i>
<p>
<i>"'So they continued until they reached the inhabitants of a town. They
asked them for food but they refused them hospitality. They found a wall
there about to fall down,' </i>meaning leaning. Al-Khadir set it up straight
with his hand. Musa said, 'We go to people who do not feed us or offer us
hospitality.<i> If you had wanted, you could have taken a wage for that.'
He said, 'This is the parting of the ways between me and you.</i>...to ...
<i>That is the explanation of the things about which you were not able to
be patient.'</i> (18:78-82)"
<p>
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Would
that he had been patient so that we would have been told more about them!"
<p>
Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "Ibn 'Abbas used to recite, 'Before them was a certain
king who seized every sound boat by force,' and he used to recite, 'As for
the youth, he was an unbeliever and his parents were believers.'"
<p>
<p>
<b>CCXVI. <i>"But when they reached their meeting-place, they forgot their
fish which quickly burrowed its way into the sea."</i> (18:61)</b>
<p>
<p>
"<i>Madhhaban</i>" is to burrow, to travel. Part of that is<i> "Walk forth
freely (sarib) by day." </i>(13:10)
<p>
4449. Ya'la ibn Muslim and 'Amr ibn Dinar related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr,
one adding to one another, and others also heard it related from Sa'id.
<p>
He said, "While we were with Ibn 'Abbas in his his house, he said, 'Ask me.'
I said, 'O Abu'l-'Abbas, amy Allah make me your ransom! There is a man in
Kufa called Nawf who claims that he is not the Musa of the Banu Isra'il'"
<p>
'Amr told me that he said, 'The enemy of Allah lied.' Ya'la told me that
Ibn 'Abbas said, 'Ubayy ibn Ka'b related to me that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said:
<p>
"Once Musa, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, reminded the people
until their eyes flowed with years and their hearts were moved. When he finished,
a man caught up to him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, is there anyone in
the earth with more knowledge than you?' He said, 'No.' Allah rebuked him
since he did not refer knowledge to Allah. It was said, 'Yes there is.' He
asked, 'O Lord, where?' He replied, 'At the junction of the two seas.' He
said, 'My Lord, assign me a token by which I will recognise that.' He said,
'It is when the fish leaves you.'" Ya'la said to me that he said, "'Take
a dead fish, and it is where life is breathed into it.' So he took a fish
and put it in a basket and told his lad, 'I do not want to burden you. But
tell me as soon as the fish leaves you.' He said, 'You have not burdened
me with much.' That is the words of Allah, <i>'When Musa said to his
servant.'</i> (18:60) It was Yusha' ibn Nun.
<p>
(That was not reported by Sa'id). "While he was in the shade of a rock at
a wet place, the fish moved while Musa was asleep. The lad said, 'I will
not wake him up.' When he woke up, he forgot to tell him, The fish moved
until it went into the sea. Allah held back the flow of the sea from the
dish so that it was as if its track was in stone." ('Amr said to me, "It
is as its track was on stone," and he made a circle with his thumbs and index
fingers.")
<p>
Musa said, "<i>'This journey of ours has made us very tired.' </i>He said,
"Allah removed exhaustion from you.'" (This is not from Sa'id.) He said,
"They returned and found al-Khadir." ('Uthman ibn Abi Sulayman said, "On
a green carpet in the middle of the sea.") Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "He was
wrapped in his garment with one end under his feet and the other under his
head. Musa greeted him and he uncovered his face and said, 'Is there a greeting
in my land? Who are you?' He replied, 'I am Musa.' He asked, 'Musa of the
Bani Israel?' 'Yes,' he replied. He asked, 'What do you want?' He said, 'I
have come so <i>that you teach me some of the right guidance which you have
been taught?' </i>He said, 'Is it not enough for you that the Torah is in
your hands and revelation comes to you? Musa, I have a knowledge which you
should not learn and you have a knowledge which I should not learn.' A bird
dipped its beak into the sea and he said, 'By Allah, my knowledge and your
knowledge in respect of the knowledge of Allah is only like what this bird
took with its beak from&nbsp;the sea.'
<p>
"When they went on the boat, they found a small ferry which carried people
from one shore to the other shore. They recognised him and said, 'The righteous
slave of Allah.'" (We asked Sa'id. 'Was it Khadir?' 'Yes, he replied.'")
"'We will not carry him for a fee.' He scuttled it and put a peg in it. Musa
said, 'Do <i>you stave it in so that its owners will be drowned? It is truly
a dreadful thing that you have done!" </i>(18:71) (Mujahid said it was an
objection.) <i>He said, 'Did I not say that you would not be able to bear
with me?' </i>The first question was forgetfulness, the third was a stipulation
and the third was deliberate. He said,<i> 'Do not take me to task because
I forgot. Do not demand of me something too difficult.'</i>
<p>
"Then they met a boy and he killed him." Ya'la said, "He found some boys
playing and he too a clever unbelieving boy, laid him down and then killed
him with a knife. Musa said,<i> 'Have you killed one who has done no wrong,
without it being in retaliation for someone else?'</i> (18:74) And he has
not done anything wrong?' (Ibn 'Abbas recited, 'innocent, pure, sound person"
as you say "innocent lad".)
<p>
"Then they proceeded and they <i>'found a wall there about to fall down and
he built it up</i>.' (Sa'id said, "With his hand like this," and he raised
his hand and made it straight.")<i> If you had wanted, you could have taken
a wage for that.'</i> (Sa'id said, "Wages which we could have eaten."
<p>
"Behind them" means "before them". Ibn 'Abbas recited this as "before them
was a king." They claim that someone other than Sa'id said that it was Hudad
ibn Budad and that the name of the boy who was killed was Jaysur.
<p>
"<i>'A king was behind them, commandeering every boat. </i>(18:79) I wanted
for him to leave it when it passed by him because of its defect. When they
had gone beyond him, then they could repair it and use it.' Some people say
that he sealed it with a bottle and some say that it was done with tar. 'His
parents were people of faith and he was an unbeliever and<i> we feared that
he would darken their days with excessive insolence and disbelief,</i> (18:80)
and love for him would move them to follow him in his <i>deen. We wanted
their Lord to give them in exchange a purer son than him</i>' (18:81), in
answer to his words<i>, 'You have killed one who has done no wrong,</i>'
and <i>'one more compassionate,'</i> meaning that they would have more merciful
to him than they were to the first whom Khadir killed." Someone other than
Sa'id claimed that they had a daughter instead. Dawud ibn Abi 'Asim said
that more than one said that it was a girl.
<p>
<p>
<b>XXXVII: <i>"When they had gone a distance further on, he said to his servant,
'Bring us our morning meal. This journey of ours has made us very tired.'
He said, '</i></b><i><b>Do you see what has happened? When we went to find
shelter at the rock, I forgot the fish</b></i><b><i>. No one made me forget
to remember it except Shaytan. It found its way into the sea in an amazing
way'" </i>(18:62-63)</b>
<p>
<i><b> </b>"Sun'"</i> (18:104) means "work." "<i>Hiwal</i>" (18:108) means
"transformation."
<p>
<i>"He said, 'This is the very thing that we were looking for!' So, following
their footsteps, they retraced their route." </i>(18:64)<i> "Imran"</i> (18:71)
and "<i>nukran</i>" (18:74) mean a calamity. "<i>Yanqadda</i>" (18:77) means
to collapse. <i>"la-takhidhta" </i>(18:77) [the reading of Abu 'Amr] is
<i>attakhadhta</i>. "<i>Ruhman</i>" (18:81) means "out of mercy." <i>Ruhm</i>
is more intensive than <i>rahma</i>. We think that it is derived from
<i>rahim</i>. Makka is called "Umm Ruhm," i.e. it is the place where mercy
descends.
<p>
4450. Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I said to Ibn 'Abbas, 'Nawf al-Bikali claims
that the Musa of the tribe of Israel is not the Musa of al-Khadir.' He said,
'The enemy of Allah has lied! Ubayy ibn Ka'b related to us from that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said:
<p>
""Musa stood up to give a speech among the Banu Isra'il and he was asked,
'Who has the most knowledge?' He replied, 'I have.' Allah censured him since
he did not ascribe this knowledge to Him. Allah revealed to him, 'Yes, there
is one of Our slaves at the meeting of the two seas who knows more than you."
Musa said, 'My Lord, how can I reach him?' He was told, 'Take a fish and
put it in a basket. When you lose the fish, follow it.' So Musa set out with
his lad Yusha' ibn Nun with the fish until they reached a rock and stopped
at it. Musa put his head down and went to sleep. (Sufyan said that in a hadith
other than the one transmitted by 'Amr, it says, 'There was a spring at the
base of the rock called al-Hayat (life). Anything that came in contact with
its water was brought to life. The fish was touched by some of the water
of that spring.') So the moved, slipped out of the basket and went into the
sea.
<p>
"When Musa woke up, he said to his lad, <i>'Bring us our morning meal...'
</i>Musa did not feel tired until he had gone beyond the place about which
Allah had commanded him. His lad, Yusha' ibn Nun, said to him, '<i>Do you
see what has happened? When we went to find shelter at the rock, I forgot
the fish</i>..'
<p>
"So they went back, retracing their steps and found in the sea something
like a tunnel through which the fish had passed like a tunnel. When they
reached the rock, there was a man wrapped in a garment. Musa greeted him,
and he said, 'How is the greeting in your land?' He replied, 'I am Musa.'
He asked, 'The Musa of the Banu Isra'il?' Musa said, 'Yes. <i>May I follow
you on condition that you teach me some of the right guidance which you have
been taught?' </i>Al-Khadir said to him, 'Musa, you have something of the
knowledge of Allah which He has taught you which I do not know and I have
something of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me which you do not
know.' Musa said, 'Can I follow you?' He answered<i>, 'Then if you follow
me, do not question me about anything till I myself make mention of it to
you.'</i>
<p>
"They continued walking along the shore. A boat passed by them and al-Khadir
was recognised, and they took them on board for free and they embarked. A
sparrow landed on the edge of the ship and dipped its beak into the sea.
Al-Khadir said to Musa, 'Your knowledge, my knowledge, and the knowledge
of all creatures in respect of the knowledge of Allah is only like what this
sparrow took with its beak. The Musa was surprised when al-Khadir picked
up an adze and scuttled the ship. Musa said to him, 'Some people carry us
for free and 'then you deliberately <i>stave it in so that its owners will
be drowned? It is truly a dreadful thing that you have done!" </i>and the
<i>ayat</i> continues.
<p>
"Then they continued and found a boy playing with some other boys. Al-Khadir
took of him by the head and cut it off. Musa said to him, <i>'Have you killed
a boy who has done no wrong, without it being in retaliation for someone
else? It is truly an appalling thing that you have done!"'He said, 'Did I
not say to you that you would not be able to bear with me?'</i>
<p>
"Then the story continues until he said, <i>'but they refused them hospitality.
They found a wall there about to fall down </i>(and he demonstrated with
hand) and al-Khadir set it up straight. Musa said, 'We went to people who
did not offer us hospitality or feed us. <i>If you had wanted, you could
have taken a wage for that!' </i>He answered<i>, 'This is the parting of
the ways between me and you. I will let you know the explanation of those
things about which you were not able to be patient.' </i>(18:78)"
<p>
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Would
that Musa had been patient so that He would have told us more about them!"
<p>
He said that Ibn 'Abbas used to recite, "Before them was a certain king who
seized every sound boat by force," and he used to recite, "As for the youth,
he was an unbeliever."

<b>CCXVIII: <i>"Say: 'Shall I inform you of the greatest losers in their

<p>
4451. It is related that Mus'ab ibn Sa'd said, "I asked my father, <i>'Say:
'Shall I inform you of the greatest losers in their actions?" </i>(18:103)
about the Haruriyya*?' He replied, 'No, it was about the Jews and Christians.
The Jews denied Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the
Christians deny the Garden, saying that there is no food or drink in it.
The Haruriyya are <i>"Those who break Allah's contract after it has been
agreed." </i>(13:25)' Sa'd used to call them evildoers (fasiqun).'"

<p>
<b>CCXIX<i>: "Those are the people who reject their Lord's Signs and the
meeting with Him. Their actions will come to nothing."</i> (18:105)</b>
<p>
4452. Abu Hurayra related that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of Rising, a huge fat man will come
who will not weigh as much as a gnat's wing in the sight of Allah." He said,
"Recite, if you wish,<i> 'On the Day of Rising, We will not assign any weight
to them.' </i>(18:105)"

Ibn 'Abbas said, "Allah says <i>'How clear will be their hearing, how perfect
their sight,' </i>(19:38), while they do no hear or see today, being <i>'in
clear misguidance.' </i>By His words,<i> 'How clear will be their hearing,
how perfect their sight,'</i> He means that on that Day, the unbelievers
will hear and see something. <i>"I will indeed stone you" </i>means <i>"I
will insult you." </i>(18:46) "<i>ri'yan</i>" (18:74) means what is seen.
<p>
Abu Wa'il said, "Maryam knew that someone who is godfearing has understanding
which is why she said, '<i>I seek refuge from you with the All-Merciful if
you are godfearing.' </i>(19:18)"
<p>
Ibn 'Uyayna said,<i> "to goad them on" </i>(19:83) means, "Provoke them to
acts of disobedience."
<p>
Mujahid said that "<i>ludd</i>" (19:97) means "crooked".
<p>
Ibn 'Abbas said that "<i>wird</i>" (19:86) means "thirsty" and
"<i>athath</i>" (19:84) means property. <i>"Idd"</i> (19:89) means a terrible
world. "<i>Rikz</i>" (19:98) means "voice".
<p>
Mujahid said that <i>"prolongs"</i> (19:75) means to leave them be,
"<i>ghayy</i>" (19:59) means loss, "<i>bukiyyan</i>" (19:58) describes a
group weeping. "<i>Silyan</i>" (19:73) comes from the verb "to burn".
"<i>Nadiyan</i>" (19:73). The singular is <i>nadi</i>, and it means a gathering.

<p>
<b>CCXXI: <i>"Warn them of the Day of Bitter Regret." </i>(19:39)</b>
<p>
4453. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Death will be brought in the form of a black
and white ram and a caller will call out, 'People of the Garden!' They will
stretch their necks and look. The caller will ask, 'Do you recognise this?'
They will reply, 'Yes, this is death.' All of them will have seen it. Then
the caller will call out, 'People of the Fire!' They will stretch their necks
and look. The caller will ask, 'Do you recognise this?' They will reply,
'Yes, this is death.' All of them will have seen it. It will be slaughtered.
Then the caller will say, 'People of the Garden! Eternity without death!
People of the Fire! Eternity without death!' Then he recited,<i> 'Warn them
of the Day of Bitter Regret when the affair will be resolved. But they are
heedless. They do not believe.' </i>(19:39) The people of this world are
in a state of heedlessness."

<b>CCXXII: <i>"We do not descend except at your Lord's command.</i>"
(19:64)</b>
<p>
4454. It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Jibril, 'What
prevents you from visiting us more than you visit us.' Then it was revealed,
<i>'We do not descend except at your Lord's command. Everything in front

<b>CCXXIII: <i>"Have you seen him who rejects Our Signs and says, 'I will

<p>
4455. It is related that Khabbab said, "I went to al-'As ibn Wa'il as-Sahmi
to ask him to settle a debt he owed me. He said, 'I will not give it to you
until you reject Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' I said,
'No, not until Allah makes you die and then you are resurrected from the
dead.' He said, 'Will I die and then be resurrected?' 'Yes,' I replied. He
said, 'So then I will have wealth and children and I will pay you.' Then
it was revealed.<i> 'Have you seen him who rejects Our Signs and says, "I
will certainly be given wealth and children there."?' </i>(19:770"

It is also related from al-A'mash.
<p>
<p>
<b>CCXXIV: <i>"Has he surveyed the Unseen or has he a contract with the
All-Merciful?"</i> (19:79)</b>
<p>
4456. It is related that Khabbab said, "I used to be a blacksmith in Makka
and I made a sword for al-'As ibn Wa'il as-Sahmi. When I went to ask him
for payment, he said, 'I will not give it to you until you reject Muhammad,

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, until Allah makes you die and resurrects
you.' He said, 'If Allah should make me die and then resurrect me, I will
have wealth and children.' So Allah revealed, <i>"Has he surveyed the Unseen

what will save my back from the hadd.' Then Jibril came down and revealed
to him,<i> 'Those who make an accusation against their wives </i>...to...

When she reached the fifth oath, the people stopped her and said, 'It will

until we thought that she would retract. Then she said, 'I will not disgrace

me."

which I was riding. They thought that I was in it. At that time women were
light and not heavy and did not have a lot of flesh on them. They used to
eat only a little. So the people did not notice the weight of the howdah
when they lifted it up and carried it as I was a young girl. They moved the
camel and set off. I found my necklace after the army had left. I came to
the camp site and there was absolutely no one there. I went to the place
where I had been, thinking that they would miss me and return for me. While
I was sitting there, drowziness overcame me and I fell asleep. Safwan ibn
al-Mu'attal as-Sulami, then adh-Dhakwani, was behind the army and he reached
my spot at morning. He saw the dark form of someone asleep, so he came to
me. He recognised me when me saw me. He had seen me before the veil. I woke
up when he said, 'We belong to Allah and to Him we return!' after he had
recognised me. I veiled my face with my head-shawl and, by Allah, we did
not speak a single word nor did I hear a single word from him except for
'We belong to Allah and to Him we return!' Then he made his camel kneel and
he put its leg down and I mounted it. He went leading the camel until we
reached the army after they had alighted to camp at the height of midday.
Then whoever was destroyed was destroyed. The one who led the lie was 'Abdullah
ibn Ubayy ibn Salul.
<p>
"We reached Madina and after I arrived, I was ill there for a month while
the people were spreading the word of the people of the lie although I was
not aware of any of that. I imagined in my illness that I did not see from
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, the kindness which
I used to see him show when I was ill. He would visit me and give the greeting
and then say, 'How is that one?' Then he would leave. That caused me some
doubt, but I was not aware of any of the evil until I recovered and I went
out with Umm Mistah to al-Manasi'. We used to go the lavatory there and we
only went out to it from night to night. That was before we put up lavatories
near our houses."
<p>
We followed the custom of the early Arabs of going to the lavatory in the
desert. We found it annoying to have lavatories by our houses." She said,
"So Umm Mistah bint Abi Ruhm ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib ibn 'Abdu Manaf, whose
mother was the daughter of Sakhr ibn Amir and the maternal aunt of Abu Bakr
as-Siddiq, and whose son was Mistah ibn Uthatha ibn 'Abbad ibn al-Muttalib
and I went out. When we finished our business, Umm Mistah and I were coming
towards my house when Umm Mistah tripped on her dress and said, 'May Mistah
stumble!' I said to her, 'What you have said is bad. Would you curse a man
who was present at Badr?' She said, 'O you there! Have you not heard what
he has said?' I said, 'And what has he said?' And she told be about what
the people of the Lie had said.
<p>
"Then I became even more ill. When I returned to my house, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came and visited me and
greeted me and then said, 'How is that one?' I said to him, 'Will you give
me permission to go to my parents?'" She said, "I wanted to make sure of
the report from them." She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, gave me permission. I said to my mother, 'Mother!
What are the people saying?' She said, 'O my daughter! Do not make too much
of the business. By Allah, seldom has there been a woman of beauty with a
husband who loves her with co-wives but that they say a lot against her.'
I said, 'Glory be to Allah! The people have been saying this?'" She said,
"I spent the entire night until morning unable to stop weeping and could
not sleep at all. Morning found me still weeping."
<p>
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, summoned
'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Usama ibn Zayd when the revelation had been delayed
to consult them and ask them about divorcing his wife." She said, "Usama
pointed out to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, what he knew of his wife's innocence and what he knew of them. Usama
said, '"Keep your wife. We know only good.' 'Ali said, 'Messenger of Allah,
Allah has not constricted you and there are many women besides her. Ask the
slavegirl to tell you the truth.'"
<p>
She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
summoned Barira and said, 'Barira, have you seen anything in her which would
make you doubt her?' Barira said to him, 'By the One who sent you with the
Truth. I have not seen her do anything for which I could criticise her beyond
the fact that she is a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's leaven
so that the sheep comes and eats it.'"
<p>
She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
stood up that day and while he was on the minbar asked for help against 'Abdullah
ibn Ubayy. He said, 'O company of Muslims! Who will help us against a man
whose injury in my family has reached me? By Allah, I only know good of my
wife. They mentioned a man about whom I only know good who has not entered
where my family is except with me!'
<p>
"Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, the brother of 'Abdu'l-Ashhal, got up and said, 'Messenger
of Allah, by Allah, we will help you against him. If he is from Aws, we will
chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers of Khazraj, command us
and we will carry out your command on him.'" She said, "Sa'd ibn 'Ubada,
the leader of Khazraj, got up. Before then he had been a virtuous man, but
zeal had carried him away, and he said to Sa'd, 'You lied, by the life of
Allah! You will not kill him and you are not able to do that! If he had been
from your group, you would not want him to be killed!' Usayd ibn al-Hudayr,
the cousin of Sa'd, got up and said to Sa'd ibn 'Ubada, 'You have lied, by
the life of Allah! We will kill him! You are a hypocrite arguing on behalf
of hypocrites!' The two clans of Aws and Khazraj were stirred up against
one another until they were ready for war while the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing on the minbar. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, continued to calm them
until they were silent and he was silent." She said, "I wept for that whole
day and I could not stop weeping and I could not sleep."
<p>
She said, "In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two
nights and a day and I could not stop weeping and I could not sleep until
I thought that weeping would split my liver. While my parents were sitting
with me while I was weeping, a woman of the Ansar asked for permission to
enter and I gave her permission. She sat down weeping with me. While he were
like that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
entered, gave the greeting, and sat down." She said, "He had not sat with
me since before the day when what was said about me was said. A month had
passed without any revelation coming to him regarding my business."
<p>
She said, "He said the <i>tashahhud</i> when he sat down and then said, '
A'isha, such-and-such about you has reached me. If you are innocent, then
Allah will show you innocent. If you have done any wrong action, then ask
forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him in repentance. If the slave of Allah
admits his sin and then repents, Allah turns to him.'" She said, "When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished what
he was saying, my tears stopped so that I was not aware of a single tear.
I said to my father, 'Answer the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, for me regarding what he said.' He said, 'By Allah,
I do not know what to say to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace.' I said to my mother, 'Answer the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for me regarding what he said.'
She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' I said, 'I am a young girl who
does not recite much of the Qur'an. By Allah, I know that you have heard
this story that people are saying and it has become fixed in yourself and
you have believed it. If I were to say to you that I am innocent, you would
not believe met. If I were to confess to something to you - and Allah knows
that I am innocent - you would believe me. By Allah, I can find no example
for you and me except for that of the father of Yusuf when he said, "(For
me) patience is most fitting: against that which you assert." Then I turned
over on my bed, Allah knowing that I was innocent and hoping that Allah would
proclaim me innocent. However, by Allah, I did not think that any revelation
would be sent down regarding me. I thought too little of myself that something
would be said in the Qur'an regarding me, however I hoped that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would have a dream in
which Allah would exonerate me.
<p>
"By Allah, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
did not get up from where he was sitting nor did any of the people of the
House leave before the revelation descended on him and he and seized by the
intense sweating which usually seized him and the sweat was pouring from
him like pearls of sweat although it was a wintry day because of the weight
of the word which descended on him. Then it left the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;and he was smiling. The first
word that he spoke was that he said to me, ' A'isha, Allah has exonerated
you.' She said, "My mother said to me, 'Go to him.' I said, 'No, by Allah!
I will not go to him and I will only praise Allah. the Mighty and Exalted!'
Then Allah Almighty revealed the ten verses, '<i>Those who propagated the
lie are a band of you.</i>. . .' (24:11)
<p>
"When Allah sent down this to exonerate me, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, who used
to provide maintenance for Mistah ibn Uthatha because he was related to him
and Mistah was poor, said, 'By Allah, I will never provide anything for Mistah
ever again after what he said about A'isha!' Then Allah Almighty sent down,
<i>'Those of you possessing affluence and ample wealth should not make oaths
that they will not give to their relatives and the very poor and those who
have emigrated in the way of Allah. They should rather pardon and overlook.
Would you not love Allah to forgive you? Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'
</i>(24:22) Abu Bakr said, 'Yes, by Allah, I want Allah to forgive me.' So
he restored to Mistah what he had been giving him. He said, 'By Allah, I
will never strip him of it!'"
<p>
A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
also asked Zaynab bint Jahsh about my business. He said to Zaynab, 'What
do you know? What have you seen?' She said, 'Messenger of Allah, I protect
my hearing and sight. By Allah, I only know good of her.'" A'isha said, "She
was my rival among the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, but Allah protected her by scrupulousness." She said, "Her sister,
Hamna, began attacking on her behalf and she was destroyed with those who
were destroyed."

lauded Allah as He deserves. Then he said, 'Following on from that, indicate

he was absent with me'
<p>
""Sa'd ibn Mu'adh got up and said, 'Messenger of Allah, by Allah, give me
permission to cut off their heads!.' A man of Khazraj, to whose party Umm
Hassan ibn Thabit belonged, rose and said, 'You have lied! By Allah, if they
had been from Aws, you would not want to cut off their heads!' It always
reached the point where there was evil between Aws and Khazraj in the mosque.
I did not know about that.
<p>
"In the evening of that day, I went to for the call of nature and Umm Mistah
went with me. She tripped and said, 'May Mistah perish!' I said, 'Mother,
do you abuse your son?' She was silent and then stumbled again and said,
'May Mistah perish!'I said to her, 'Do you curse your son?' When she stumbled
a third time, she said, 'May Mistah perish!' I rebuked her and she said,
'By Allah, I only abuse him because of you.' I said, 'Concerning what about
me?' she disclosed the business to me. I said, 'Is that the case?' She said,
'Yes, by Allah.'
<p>
'I returned to my room in such astonishment that I did not know at all why
I had gone out. Then I fell ill with a fever. I said to the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Send me to my father's house.'
He sent the slave with me. I entered the house and found Umm Ruman downstairs
while Abu Bakr was upstairs reciting. My mother asked, 'What has brought
you, little daughter?' I told her the story but it did not affect her as
it had affected me. She said, 'Little daughter, do not make too much of the
business. By Allah, seldom has there been a woman of beauty with a husband
who loves her with co-wives but that they envy her and talk about her.' It
did not affect her as it affected me. I asked, 'Does my father know about
it?' 'Yes,' she replied. I said, 'And the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace?' 'Yes,' she replied, 'the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, as well.' My eyes filled with tears
and I wept. Abu Bakr heard my voice while he was reciting upstairs and came
down and asked my mother, 'What is wrong with her?' She replied, 'She has
heard what is being said about her.' He wept and said, 'I ask by Allah, little
daughter, to go back to your home.' So I went back.
<p>
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had come
to my home and asked my woman servant about me. She had said, 'By Allah,
I do not know of anything which I could criticise in her beyond the fact
that she sleeps so that a sheep can enter and eat her dough (or leaven).'
Some of his Companions rebuked her and said, 'Tell the truth to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!' until they explicitly
stated what the business was. She said, 'Glory be to Allah! By Allah, I do
not know anything about her other than what a goldsmith knows of a piece
of pure gold!' When this business reached the man who was accused, he said,
'Glory be to Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of
a woman!' He was killed as a martyr in the Way of Allah.'"

She said, "In the morning my parents came and remained with me until the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to me after
he had prayed<i> 'Asr.</i> He came in while my parents were around me, on
my right and my left. He praised and lauded Allah. Then he said, 'Following
on from that. 'A'isha, if you have committed something bad or done wrong,
then repent to Allah. Allah accepts repentance from His slaves.' An Ansari
woman had come and was sitting at the door. I said, 'Are you not embarrassed
to mention such a thing in the presence of this woman?' The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, spoke an admonishment and
I turned to my father. I said, 'Answer him.' He said, 'What should I say?'
Then I turned to my mother and I said, 'Answer him.' She said, 'What should
I say?' When they did not answer him, I said the shahada. I praised and lauded
Allah as He deserves. Then I said, 'Following on from that, if I were to
tell you that I did not do it, and Allah Almighty is a witness that I am
speaking the truth, that would not be of any use to me with you. You have
spoken about it and your hearts have drunk it. If I were to say that I have
done it, and Allah knows that I did not do it, you would say, "She has admitted
it.' By Allah, I can find no example for you and me except for that of the
father of Yusuf (as I tried to remember Ya'qub name but could not remember
it) when he said, "<i>But steadfast patience, that is beautiful in the face
of that which you assert."' </i>
<p>
"At that very moment, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, received revelation, so we were silent. When it left him, I notived
happiness in his face while he wiped his brow. He said, 'Good news, 'A'isha!
Allah has revealed your innocence.' I was extremely angry at that time. My
parents told me, 'Go to him.' I replied, 'By Allah, I will not go to him
or praise him or praise you two. Rather I will praise Allah who revealed
my innocence. You heard this and did not deny it or change it!'"

to spread it and collect it. He and Hamna wer those who 'took on himself

the people to eat. They ate and then remained sitting in conversation. Then
the Prophet seemed ready to get up, but they did not get up. Then he actually
got up, and when he did so, everyone got up except for three individuals.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came back to enter
and found the people still sitting there. Then they finally got up. So I
went and told the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;that
they had gone. He went inside. I went to enter, but he put up a screen between
me and him, and then Allah revealed, <i>'O you who believe! Do not go into
the Prophet's rooms...' </i>(33:53)"
<p>
4514. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "I am the person who has the
most knowledge of the <i>Ayat</i> of the Veil. When Zaynab bint Jahsh was
adorned for her wedding with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, she was with him in the room and he prepared some food
and invited the people to it. They sat down and conversed [after the meal].
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to go out and
then come back, but they remained sitting there conversing. So Allah Almighty
revealed, '<i>O you who believe! Do not go into the Prophet's room</i>
<i>except when you are invited to come and eat. Do not wait there while the
food is being cooked. </i>... to ... <i>from behind a screen</i>.' (33:53)
So the Veil was set up and the people left."

the marriage of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to
Zaynab bint Jahsh. I was sent to visit the people to the food, and the people
came, ate and then left. Then another group would come, eat and leave. I
continued to invite people until I could not find anyone else to invite.
I said, 'Prophet of Allah! I do not find anyone else to invite.' He said,
'Remove your food.' A group of three remaining in the room conversing. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out and went to the
room of 'A'isha and said, 'Peace be upon you, people of the house, and His
mercy.' She said, 'Peace and the mercy of Allah be upon you? How did you
find your wife. May Allah bless you.' He visited the rooms of all of his
wives, one after the other, saying to them the like of what he had said to
'A'isha and they answered him with the like of what 'A'isha had said. Then
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, returned and the three
people were still conversing in the house. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was very shy and so went out towards the room of 'A'isha.
I do not know whether I told him or he was told that the people had left.
He came back and as soon as he had placed one foot across the threshold,
while the other was still on the outside, he lowered the curtain between
me and him and the Ayat of the Veil was revealed."

4516. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, held a feast when he married Zaynab bint Jahsh.
The people had their fill of bread and meat. Then he went out to the rooms
of the Mothers of the Believers as he used to do on the morning of a marriage.
He greeted them and they greeted him. He made supplication for them and they
made supplication for him. When he returned to his house, he saw two men
conversing. When he saw them, he went out of his house again. When the two
men saw the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, leave
his house, they quickly got up. I do not know whether I told him about their
departure or whether he was informed [by someone else]. He came back and
entered the house and lowered the curtain between me and him and the Ayat

after the Veil had been established. She was a corpulent woman and easily
recognised by people. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab saw her and said, 'Sawda! By Allah,
you are not hidden from us! Think of how you should go out." She went back
while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
in my room. He was having supper and was holding in his hand a bone with
meat on it. She came in and said, 'Messenger of Allah! I went out for a call
of nature and 'Umar said such-and-such to me.' Then Allah gave him revelation
and then it left him while the bone was still in his hand and he had not
put it down. He said, 'Allah has allowed you to go out for your needs.'"

to affirm that rabbi. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, recited, <i>'They do not measure Allah with His true measure.
The whole earth will be a mere handful for Him on the Day of Rising, the
heavens folded up in His right hand. Glory be to Him! He is exalted above
the partners they ascribe!' </i>(39:67)"
<p>
<p>
<b>CCXCVIII. His words,<i> "The whole earth will be a mere handful for Him
on the Day of Rising, the heavens folded up in His right hand."</i> (39:67)</b>
<p>
4534. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Allah will grasp the earth
and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Then He will say, "I
am the King. Where are the kings of the earth?"'"
<p>
<p>
<b>CCXCIX:<i> "The Trumpet will be blown and all in the heavens and all in
the earth will lose consciousness, except those Allah wills. Then it will
be blown a second time and at once they will be standing upright, looking
on." </i>(39:68)</b>
<p>
4535. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "After the second blast, I will be the first to
lift my head and there will be Musa grasping one of the legs of the Throne.
I do not know whether he had been there all the time or whether that was
after the blast."
<p>
4536. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There will be forty between the two blasts of
the Trumpet." They asked, "Abu Hurayra, forty days?" He said, "I refused
to answer." They said, "Forty years?" He said, "I refused to answer." They
said, "Forty months?" He said, "I refused to answer." [The hadith continues],
"Every part of the human being will decay except for the coccyx. It is from
that the creation will be reconstituted."
