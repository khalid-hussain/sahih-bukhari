<P>
<B>I: The obligatory nature of the Jumu'a prayer </B>
<P>
This is based on the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"When the prayer is called
on the Day of Jumu'a, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave commerce.
That is better for you if you only knew." </I>(62:9)
<P>
836. It is related that Abu Hurayra heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, "We are the last but will be the first
on the Day of Rising, in spite of the fact that others were given the Book
before us. This was the day which was made obligatory for them but they disagreed
about it. Allah has guided us to it and the other people follow us. The Jews
have tomorrow and the Christians the day after."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The excellence of doing <I>ghusl</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I> and
whether children or women should attend </B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#j5">837</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone
who comes to<I> Jumu'a s</I>hould perform <I>ghusl</I>."
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#j3">838</A>. It is related from Ibn 'Umar, "Once while
'Umar ibn al-Khattab was standing giving the <I>khutba</I> on the day of
<I>Jumu'a</I>, one of the first of the Muhajir Companions of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came in. 'Umar called out to him,
'What kind of time is this?' He said, 'I was busy and so could not return
to my family until I heard the <I>adhan</I>. I stayed only long enough to
do<I> wudu'</I>.' He said, 'Only<I> wudu' </I>as well! Yet you know that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, instructed
us to perform&nbsp;<I>ghusl</I>!'"
<P>
839. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Performing <I>ghusl</I> on
the day of<I> Jumu'a </I>is obligatory for every male who has reached puberty."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Wearing perfume for the <I>Jumu'a</I> prayer</B>
<P>
840. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "I testify that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, '<I>Ghusl </I>on the
day of <I>Jumu'a </I>is obligatory for every male who has reached puberty
and also cleaning the teeth and putting on perfume if it is available." 'Amr
said, "I testify that <I>ghusl</I> is obligatory but Allah knows best whether
teeth-cleaning and perfume are obligatory or not. However, that is how it
is in the <I>hadith</I>.
<P>
This is related from Bukayr ibn al-Ashajj and Sa'id ibn Abi Hilal and a number
of others.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The excellence of the Jumu'a prayer</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#j1">841</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone has
a <I>ghusl </I>on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I>, the same as for <I>janaba</I>,
and then goes [to the prayer] in the first part of the time, it is as if
he has sacrificed a camel. If he goes in the second part of the time, it
is as if he has sacrificed a cow. If he goes in the third part of the time,
it is as if he has sacrificed a horned ram. If he goes in the fourth part
of the time, it is as if he has sacrificed a hen. If he goes in the fifth
part of the time, it is as if he has sacrificed an egg. When the Imam comes
out, the angels settle down to listen to the reminder."
<P>
842. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "Once while 'Umar was giving the
<I>khutba</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I>, a man came in. 'Umar said, 'What
kept you from the prayer?' The man said, 'It was only that I heard the
<I>adhan</I> and then did <I>wudu</I>'.' He said, 'Did you not hear the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Anyone who goes to <I>Jumu'a
</I>should perform a &nbsp;<I>ghusl</I>?" ' "
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Using hair oil for the<I> Jumu'a</I> prayer</B>
<P>
843. It is related from Salman al-Farisi that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "When a man has a <I>ghusl</I> on the day
of<I> Jumu'a</I>, making himself as pure as possible, uses his hair oil or
puts on any perfume he has in his house, then goes out and does not split
up two people, and then prays what is prescribed for him and is silent while
the Imam speaks, he is forgiven everything between then and the previous
<I>Jumu'a</I>."
<P>
844. It is related from Tawus, "I said to Ibn 'Abbas, 'They mention that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Perform
<I>ghusl</I> on the Day of <I>Jumu'a </I>and wash your heads even if you
are not in <I>janaba</I> and use perfume.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'As for the
<I>ghusl</I>, yes, but I do not know about the perfume.' "
<P>
845. It is related from Tawus, "Ibn 'Abbas mentioned what the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said about <I>ghusl</I> on the Day
of <I>Jumu'a</I> and I said to him, 'Did he use perfume or oil if there was
any in his household?' He said, 'I do not know.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Wearing the best clothes available</B>
<P>
846. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab saw
a silk robe by the door of the mosque and said, "Messenger of Allah, if you
were to buy this you could wear it on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I> and to receive
delegations when they come to you." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "This will only be worn by someone who has
no share of the Next World." Afterwards cloaks of a similar kind were brought
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and he
gave one of them to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab. 'Umar said, "Messenger of Allah!
You give it to me when you said what you said about the cloak of 'Atarid!"
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I
did not give it to you to wear." 'Umar gave it to a brother of his who was
an idolater in Makka."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: <I>Siwak</I> (tooth-stick) on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
Abu Sa'id said that the Prophet cleaned his teeth.
<P>
<A HREF="muw1.html#116">847</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If it
was not for the fact that I might be overburdening my community, or the people.
I would have ordered them to use the siwak for every prayer."
<P>
848. It is related from Anas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "How many times have I told you about the
siwak."
<P>
849. It is related that Hudhayfa said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, got up in the night, he would rinse out his mouth."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Someone using another's siwak</B>
<P>
850. It is related that 'A'isha said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr came in
with a siwak with which he was cleaning his teeth. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked at him and so I said to him,
'Give me that siwak, 'Abdu'r-Rahman.' He gave it to me and I broke it in
half, chewed it and gave it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and he cleaned his teeth with it while leaning against
my breast."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: What should be recited in the <I>Fajr</I> prayer on the Day of
<I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
851. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "In the <I>Fajr</I> prayer on
<I>Jumu'a</I> the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used
to recite <I>'Alif Lam Mim, Tanzilu...'</I> (32) and <I>'Hal ata ala'l-insani...'
</I>(76)"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer in villages and cities</B>
<P>
852. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The first <I>Jumu'a</I> prayer
to be held after the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer in the mosque of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was that held in the mosque
of 'Abdu'l-Qays at Juwathi in Bahrayn."
<P>
853. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "All of you are shepherds."
<P>
Al-Layth added that Yunus said, "Ruzayq ibn Hukaym wrote to Ibn Shihab -
and I was with him that day at Wadi'l-Qura - saying, 'Do you think I should
hold a Jumu'a prayer?' Ruzayq was working on a piece of land together with
a group of black people and others, being the governor of Ayla at that time.
Ibn Shihab wrote, and I was listening, commanding him to hold the Jumu'a
prayer and telling him that Salim had related to him that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar
used to say, "I heard the Messenger of Allah say, 'All of you are shepherds
and each of you is responsible for his flock. An Imam is a shepherd and he
is responsible for those in his care. A man is a shepherd in his family and
is responsible for those in his care. The woman is a shepherd in her husband's
house and is responsible for those in her care. The servant is a shepherd
of his master's property and is responsible for what is in his care.' " He
said, "I think that he also said, 'A man is a shepherd of his father's property
and is responsible for what is in his care. All of you are shepherds and
each of you is responsible for his flock.' "
<P>
[Wadi'l-Qura: one of the cities of the Hijaz. Ayla is now a ruin.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Is it necessary for women, children and others who attend the Jumu'a
prayer to have a <I>ghusl</I>? </B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "<I>Ghusl</I> is obligatory for all those for whom the
<I>Jumu'a</I> prayer is obligatory."
<P>
854. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Anyone who comes
to the <I>Jumu'a </I>should perform <I>ghusl</I>.'"
<P>
855. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "<I>Ghusl </I>on the day of
<I>Jumu'a </I>is obligatory for every male who has reached puberty."
<P>
856. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "We are the last but will be the first
on the Day of Rising, in spite of the fact that others were given the Book
before us. This was the day which was made obligatory for them but they disagreed
about it. Allah has guided us to it and the other people follow us. The Jews
have tomorrow and the Christians the day after." "He was silent and then
said, "It is a duty for every Muslim to do <I>ghusl</I> once every seven
days in the course of which he should wash his head and his body."
<P>
It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Every Muslim has a duty to Allah to perform a
<I>ghusl</I> once every seven days."
<P>
857. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Permit women to go to the mosque at night."
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#q12">858</A>. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "A wife
of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab used to attend the group prayers of <I>Subh</I> and
<I>'Isha'</I> in the mosque. She was asked, 'Why do you come out when you
know that 'Umar dislikes it and is jealous?' She said, 'What stops him from
forbidding me then?' The man said, 'The words of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Do not forbid the female slaves
of Allah from attending the mosques of Allah."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: The dispensation not to attend the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer if it is
raining</B>
<P>
859. It is related from Muhammad ibn Sirin, "Ibn 'Abbas said to his
<I>mu'adhdhin</I> on a rainy day, 'After you say, "I testify that Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah," do not say, "Come to prayer." Say, "Pray in your
homes." ' It seemed that the people disapproved of that. He said, 'One better
than I did this. The <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer is clearly a duty but I most certainly
do not want to force you to come out and walk through the mud and slush.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: From how far should you come to the Jumu'a prayer and for whom it
is obligatory? </B>
<P>
This is based on the words of Allah, Mighty and Exalted, <I>"When the prayer
is called on the Day of Jumu'a</I>." (62:9)
<P>
'Ata' said, "If you are in a sizeable town and the prayer is called on the
day of <I>Jumu'a, </I>then you must attend it whether or not you hear the
call.
<P>
Anas used sometimes to hold the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer in his fortress and
sometimes not, when he was at az-Zawiya about two parasangs away [Basra].
<P>
[About six miles]
<P>
860. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The people used to come from their homes
and from al-'Awali on the day of Jumu'a. They would come through the dust
and become covered in dust and sweat. Sweat would pour from them. One of
them came to visit the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, when he was with me. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'If only you would clean yourselves for this day of yours.'"
<P>
[al-'Awali: places close to Madina]
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: The time of the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer is when the sun starts to
decline.</B>
<P>
This is what is related from 'Umar, 'Ali, an-Nu'man ibn Bashir and 'Amr ibn
Hurayth.
<P>
861. It is related that Yahya ibn Sa'id asked 'Amr about <I>ghusl</I> on
the day of <I>Jumu'a.</I> She said that 'A'isha said, "People used to work.
When they went to <I>Jumu'a </I>in that condition, they were told, 'If only
you had done <I>ghusl</I>.'"
<P>
862. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet used to pray<I>
Jumu'a</I> the moment that the sun started to decline.
<P>
863. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We used to do the <I>Jumu'a
</I>prayer early and have a nap after it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: When the heat is intense on the day of<I> Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
864. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "When it was very
cold, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to go early
to the prayer. When it was very hot, he would delay the prayer until it was
cooler, meaning the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer."
<P>
It is related from Abu Khalda that he said "prayer" and did not specify
"<I>Jumu'a</I>".
<P>
It is related that Abu Khalda said, "The amir * led us in th<I>e Jumu'a
</I>prayer." Then he asked Anas, "How did the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, pray <I>Dhuhr</I>?"
<P>
[*It was al-Hakam ibn Abi 'Aqil ath-Thaqafi.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Walking to the <I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
And the words of Allah Almighty, "<I>Hasten to the remembrance of Allah</I>"
(62:9) and someone who says that "Hastening" means "to act and go" as it
means in the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"strives after it as he should
strive."</I> (17:19)
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "Trading is forbidden at that time." 'Ata' said, "All kinds
of work are forbidden." Az-Zuhri said, "When the <I>mu'adhdhin</I> gives
the <I>adhan</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I>, even someone on a journey should
attend."
<P>
865. It is related from 'Abaya ibn Rifa'a said, "Abu 'Abs caught up with
me when I was on my way to the <I>Jumu'a </I>and said, 'I heard the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Allah will forbid from the
Fire anyone whose feet become dusty in the way of Allah " ' "
<P>
866. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'When the prayer is held, do not
come to it running. Come to it walking. You must be tranquil. Pray what you
catch and complete what you miss.'"
<P>
867. It is related from Abu Qatada that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Do not stand up until you see me and you must
be tranquil."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Do not separate two people on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
868. It is related from Salman al-Farisi that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When a man has a <I>ghusl</I>
on the day of<I> Jumu'a</I>, making himself as pure as possible, uses his
hair oil or puts on any perfume he has in his house, then goes out and does
not split up two people, and then prays what is prescribed for him and is
silent while the Imam speaks, he is forgiven everything between then and
the previous Jumu'a."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: A man should not make his brother get up on the day of Jumu'a and
then sit down in his place</B>
<P>
869. It is related that Ibn Jurayj said, "I heard Nafi' say, 'I heard Ibn
'Umar say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade
a man to make his brother get up from his place and then to sit down in it."
' I asked Nafi', '<I>Jumu'</I>a?' He said, "Both<I> Jumu'a</I> and other
prayers.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: The <I>Adhan</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
870. It is related that as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid said, "During the time of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr and 'Umar,
the first call on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I> was made when the Imam sat on
the minbar. In the time of 'Uthman when the number of people had increased,
a third call was added at az-Zawra'."
<P>
Abu 'Abdallah said, "'Az-Zawra' is a place in the market of Madina."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: One <I>mu'adhdhin</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
871. It is related from as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid: "The one who added the third
<I>adhan</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a </I>was 'Uthman ibn 'Affan when the
number of people in Madina increased. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, only had one <I>mu'adhdhin</I> and the <I>adhan</I> on the
day of Jumu'a was called when the Imam sat down," meaning on the minbar.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: The Imam responds to the <I>adhan</I> on the minbar when he hears
the call to prayer</B>
<P>
872. It is related that Abu Umama ibn Sahl ibn Hunayf said, "I heard Mu'awiya
ibn Abi Sufyan, when he was sitting on the minbar. The <I>mu'adhdhin</I>
gave the <I>adhan</I>, saying, 'Allah is greater. Allah is greater,' Mu'awiya
said, 'Allah is greater. Allah is greater.' He said, 'I testify that there
is no god but Allah,' and Mu'awiya said, 'And I.' He said, 'I testify that
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,' and Mu'awiya said, 'And I.' When the
<I>adhan</I> was finished, he said, 'O people! I was listening to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as the<I> mu'adhdhin
</I>gave the <I>adhan</I> when he was sitting in this very place, and he
said what you heard me say.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: Sitting on the minbar when the <I>adhan</I> is given</B>
<P>
873. It is related from as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid that 'Uthman ordered there to
be a second <I>adhan</I> on the Day of<I> Jumu'a </I>when the number of people
in the mosque increased. The <I>adhan</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a </I>had
previously been called when the Imam sat down."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: The <I>adhan</I> before the<I> khutba</I></B>
<P>
874. It is related that as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid was heard to say, "In the beginning,
during the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and Abu Bakr and 'Umar, the <I>adhan</I> on the day of<I> Jumu'a
</I>was called when the Imam sat on the minbar. But when, during the the
khalifate of 'Uthman, the number of people increased, 'Uthman ordered there
to be a third <I>adhan</I> on the Day of <I>Jumu'a </I>which was given in
az-Zawra' and that remained the practice."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: The <I>khutba</I> being given on the minbar</B>
<P>
Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the
<I>khutba</I> on the minbar."
<P>
875. It is related from Abu Hazim ibn Dinar that some men came to Sahl ibn
Sa'd as-Sa'idi and disagreed about the wood the minbar was made of. They
asked him about it and he said, "By Allah, I know what it was made of. Indeed
I saw it on the day it was made and the day when the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, first sat on it. The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent to a certain woman (whom
Sahl named) saying, 'Instruct your slave, the carpenter, to make me something
out of wood on which I can sit when I speak to the people.' She gave him
this instruction and he made it from desert tamarisk. He brought it to her
and she sent it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, who commanded that it be placed here. Then I saw the Messenger
of Allah praying on it, saying the <I>takbir</I> while standing on it and
doing <I>ruku'</I> while on it. Then he stepped down and went into sajda
at the foot of the minbar and then climbed back on it again. When he finished,
he faced the people and said, 'O people! I did this so that you could follow
me and learn how I pray.' "
<P>
876. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to say, "There was
a palm trunk which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to lean against. When the minbar was made for him, we heard the trunk
making a sound like a pregnant she-camel until the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came down and placed his hand on it."
<P>
It is related that Anas heard it from Jabir.
<P>
877. It is related from Salim that his father said, "I heard the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, speak on the minbar and say, 'Anyone
who comes to the <I>Jumu'a </I>should perform a <I>ghusl</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: The khutba while standing</B>
<P>
Anas said, "While the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
giving the khutba standing..."
<P>
878. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to give the <I>khutba</I> standing and then he
would sit and then stand up again just as you do now."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: The Imam facing the people and the people facing the Imam when he
gives the <I>khutba</I></B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar and Anas faced the Imam.
<P>
879. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sat one day on the minbar and we sat around
him."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: Saying, <I>amma ba'd </I>("following on from that") in the
<I>khutba</I> after giving praise</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas related this from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace.
<P>
880. It is related that Asma' bint Abi Bakr said, "I visited 'A'isha when
the people were praying and said, 'What is happening with the people?' She
pointed towards the heaven and I said, 'A sign?' She nodded with her head,
meaning yes." She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, continued for a very long time until I fainted. There was
a waterskin beside me and I opened it and began to pour some of it on my
head. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished
and the sun appeared. He addressed the people and praised Allah as is His
due. Then he said, 'Following on from that <I>(amma ba'd</I>).'" She said,
"Some of the women of the Ansar were talking noisily and I turned to them
in order to make them be quiet. I asked 'A'isha, 'What did he say?' She said,
'Anything which I did not see before I saw just now while standing here,
including the Garden and the Fire. It was revealed to me that you will be
tested in the graves with a like trial - or nearly like to that of the False
Messiah. (The angels) will come to everyone of you and he will be asked,
"What do you know of this man?" The believer or the one who is certain Hisham
was unsure) will say, "He is the Messenger of Allah. He is Muhammad, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, who has brought us the clear signs and
the guidance and so we believed and answered and followed and confirmed."
He will be told, "Sleep, virtuous one. We know that you believed in him."
The hypocrite - or he said the doubter (Hisham was unsure) will be asked,
"What do you know of this man?" He will say, "I do not know. I heard the
people saying something and and I said it." ' "
<P>
Hisham said, "Fatima said to me, 'I remembered it by heart,' except that
she mentioned the manner in which he would be harshly dealt with in."
<P>
881. It is related from 'Amr ibn Taghlib, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was brought some money or captives and shared
them out. He gave to some men and left others out. He heard that those who
had been left out had been critical about it. He praised Allah and glorified
Him and then said, 'Following on from that (<I>amma ba'd</I>), by Allah,
I give to one man and leave out another and yet I love the one whom I leave
out more than the one I give to. But I give to some people because of the
anxiety and unease I see in their hearts. I entrust some people to the wealth
and good which Allah has placed in their hearts. One of those is 'Amr ibn
Taghlib.' By Allah, what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said is dearer to me than red camels."
<P>
Yunus corroborated it.
<P>
882. It is related from 'A'isha, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went out one night in the middle of the night and
prayed in the mosque and some men followed his prayer. In the morning the
people spoke about it and more of them gathered and prayed with him. In the
morning the people spoke and there were more people in the mosque on the
third night. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
went out and they followed his prayer. On the fourth night the mosque was
unable to accommodate the people so that he only came out for the Subh prayer.
When he had finished <I>Fajr,</I> he faced the people and said the
<U><I>shahada</I></U>. Then he said, 'Following on from that &nbsp;(<I>amma
ba'd</I>), your position was not hidden from me, but I feared that it would
be made compulsory for you and you would be unable to do it.'"
<P>
Yunus corroborated it.
<P>
883. It is related that Abu Humayd as-Sa'idi said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up one evening after the prayer.
He said the shahada and praised Allah as is His due and then he said, 'Following
on from that (<I>amma ba'd</I>).'"
<P>
Hisham corroborated it from his father from Abu Humayd that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Following on from that <I>(amma
ba'd</I>)."
<P>
"Following on from that (<I>amma ba'd</I>)" is corroborated from Sufyan.
<P>
884. It is related that al-Miswar ibn Makhrama said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up and I heard him say, "Following
on from that (<I>amma ba'd</I>)" after he said the <I>shahada</I>."
<P>
Az-Zuhri corroborated it.
<P>
885. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, climbed the minbar for the last gathering in which he
participated. He had a large wrapper around his shoulders and his head was
bound with an oily band. He praised Allah and glorified Him and then said,
'O people, come here to me!' so they gathered round him. Then he said, 'Following
on from that (<I>amma ba'd</I>), the area inhabited by the Ansar will diminish
and the number of other people will increase. Whoever comes to rule over
any of the community of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and is therefore able to bring harm and benefit to people should accept the
good among them and pardon any of them who act badly.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: Sitting down between the two <I>khutbas</I> on the Day of
<I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
886. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to give two <I>khutbas</I> between which he would
sit down."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: Listening to the <I>khutba</I></B>
<P>
887. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of <I>Jumu'a</I>, the angels stand
at the door of the mosque and write down the first to come and then those
who follow. Those who come early are like someone who sacrifices a camel,
the next like someone who sacrifices a cow and then a ram and then a chicken
and then an egg. When the Imam comes out, they roll up their scrolls and
listen to the reminder."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: When the Imam sees a man coming while he is giving the <I>khutba</I>,
he orders him to pray two <I>rak'ats</I></B>
<P>
888. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "A man came when the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was addressing the people on the
day of <I>Jumu'a </I>and he said, 'So-and-so, have you prayed?' He said,
'No.' He said, 'Get up and pray.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXI: The one who comes when the Imam is speaking should pray two quick
<I>rak'ats</I></B>
<P>
889. It is related that Jabir said, "A man came in on the Day of
<I>Jumu'a</I>.while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was giving the <I>khutba</I> and he said, 'Have you prayed?' He said, 'Yes.'
He said, 'Stand and pray two<I> rak'ats</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXII: Raising the hands during the <I>khutba</I></B>
<P>
890. It is related that Anas said, "Once while the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was giving a <I>khutba</I> on the Day of <I>Jumu'a
</I>a man stood up and said, 'Messenger of Allah, the horses are dying and
the sheep are dying. Ask Allah to give us rain.' He stretched out his arms
and made supplication."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIII: Praying for rain in the <I>khutba</I> on the day of
<I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
891. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "There was a drought in the
time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and when the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was giving the <I>khutba</I>
on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I>, a Bedouin stood up and said, 'Messenger of Allah,
our property is being destroyed and the children are hungry, so pray to Allah
for us.' He raised his hands and we could not see a cloud in the sky. By
the One who has my soul in His hand, as soon as he lowered them, clouds like
mountains swirled up. Then as soon as he came down from his minbar, I saw
the rain falling on his beard, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. It
rained on us that day and the next and the next and that which followed until
the next Jumu'a when that Bedouin, or another one, stood up and said, 'O
Messenger of Allah, our houses have fallen down and our property is flooded,
so pray to Allah for us.' He raised his hands and said, 'O Allah, around
us but not on us.' In whatever direction he pointed with his hand, the clouds
dispersed and Madina became like a gap (in the clouds). The river-bed of
Qanat flowed with water for a month and all who came from elsewhere spoke
about the abundant rain."
<P>
[Qanat is one of the wadis of Madina]
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIV: Remaining silent and paying attention on the day of <I>Jumu'a
</I>when the Imam is speaking</B>
<P>
Even a person saying to his companion, "Be quiet!" constitutes foolish chatter.
Salman reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Be silent and pay attention when the Imam is speaking."
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#j6">892</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Even saying, 'Be
quiet!' to your companion while the Imam is giving the <I>khutba</I> on the
Day of Jumu'a constitutes foolish chatter."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXV: The special time on the Day of <I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw2.html#p16">893</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned the
day of <I>Jumu'a a</I>nd said, "There is a time during it when Allah Almighty
gives to a Muslim standing in prayer whatever he asks for." He indicated
how small it was with his hand.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVI: If some people abandon the Imam during the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer,
the prayer of the Imam and those who remain is valid</B>
<P>
894. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "Once while we were praying
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a caravan carrying
food came and people went off towards it until there were only twelve men
left with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and this
ayat was sent down: <I>'But when they see some merchandise or diversion,
they scatter off to it and leave you standing.'</I> (62:11)"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: Praying before and after <I>Jumu'a</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t72">895</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
pray two<I> rak'ats</I> before <I>Dhuhr</I> and two after it and two <I>rak'ats
</I>after <I>Maghrib</I> in his house and two<I> rak'ats </I>after<I>
'Isha'</I>. He did not pray after the <I>Jumu'a</I> prayer until he had left
and then he would pray two <I>rak'ats</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVIII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"When the prayer is finished,
spread through the land and seek the bounty of Allah." </I>(62:10)</B>
<P>
896. It is related that Sahl said, "There was a woman among us who planted
garden-beet (<I>silq</I>) on the irrigation channels in a field she owned.
On the day of <I>Jumu'a </I>she would pull up the beet by the roots and put
them in a pot. Then she would put in a handful of barley and cook it. The
beet roots were like meat. After finishing the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer we would
greet her and then she would bring us that food and we would eat it with
our fingers. We used to look forward to the day of <I>Jumu'a </I>because
of that food of hers."
<P>
897. This is related from Sahl and he said, "We did not have a afternoon
nap or lunch except after <I>Jumu'a.</I>"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: The afternoon nap after the <I>Jumu'a </I>prayer</B>
<P>
898. It is related that Anas was heard to say, "We used to go early to the
<I>Jumu'a</I> prayer and then have an afternoon nap."
<P>
899. It is related that Sahl said, "We used to pray <I>Jumu'a</I> with the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then have an afternoon
nap."

Prayer</A></BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<P>
<B>I. The Fear Prayer</B>
<P>
And the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"When you are travelling in the land,
there is nothing wrong in your shortening the prayer if you fear that those
who reject might harrass you. The rejectors are your clear-cut enemies. When
you are with them and are leading them in the prayer, a group of them should
stand with you keeping hold of their weapons. When they prostrate, the others
should be behind you. Then the other group who have not prayed should come
and pray with you. They too should be careful and keep hold of their weapons.
Those who reject would like you to be negligent of your arms and equipment
so that they can swoop down on you once and for all. There is nothing wrong,
if you are bothered by rain or you are ill, in laying your weapons down;
but take every precaution. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for
the rejectors."</I> (4:101-102)
<P>
<P>
900. It is related that Shu'ayb said, "I asked az-Zuhri, 'Did the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray it, meaning. the Fear Prayer?'
He said, 'Salim informed me that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I went on an
expedition with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, in the direction of Najd. We faced the enemy, forming up into rows
opposite them. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, stood up to lead us in the prayer and one group stood to pray with
him while another group faced the enemy. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, did <I>ruku' </I>and did two prostrations
with those with him. Then that group took the place of those who had not
yet prayed. They came and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, did <I>ruku' </I>once with them and did two prostrations.
Then he said the <I>taslim</I> and then all of them stood up and bowed and
did two prostrations for themselves."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The Fear Prayer while on foot or mounted</B>
<P>
901. Something similar to what Mujahid said is related by Ibn 'Umar, "When
battle has been joined they can pray standing." And Ibn 'Umar added from
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "If the enemy are greater
in number then pray standing or mounted."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Some people standing guard over others during the Fear Prayer</B>
<P>
902. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, stood and the people stood with him. He said the
<I>takbir</I> and they said the <I>takbir</I> with him. He went into
<I>ruku'</I> and some of the people went into<I> ruku' </I>with him. Then
he went into <I>sajda</I> and they went into <I>sajda</I> with him. Then
he stood up for the second <I>rak'at </I>and those who had done <I>sajda</I>
stood and guarded their brothers and the second group came and went into
<I>ruku'</I> and <I>sajda</I> with him. All the people did the prayer, but
guarded one another at the same time."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The prayer when besieging fortresses and encountering the enemy</B>
<P>
Al-Awza'i said, "If victory is imminent and there is no possibility of people
doing the prayer, then everyone should pray individually by gesture. If they
cannot make the gestures, then they should delay the prayer until the fighting
is over or they are in a safe place and then pray two<I> rak'ats</I>. If
this is not possible for them they should pray one <I>rak'at</I> with two
<I>sajdas</I>. If they cannot do this, saying the takbir alone is not sufficient
and they should delay the prayer until they are really secure." Makhul said
this.
<P>
Anas said, "I was present at the siege of the fortress of Tustar, arriving
when the dawn was coming up. The fighting was intense and the people could
not pray. We did not pray until well into the day when we did the prayer
with Abu Musa and were granted victory." Anas said, "I would not take this
world and everything in it in exchange for that prayer."
<P>
[Tustar was a well-known city in Iraq.]
<P>
903. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "On the Day of the Ditch
'Umar ibn al-Khattab came and began to curse the unbelievers of Quraysh and
then said, 'Messenger of Allah, I have not prayed<I> 'Asr </I>and the sun
has almost set.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'And, by Allah, I too have not yet prayed it.' He went down to Buthan and
did <I>wudu' </I>and prayed <I>'Asr </I>after the sun had set and then then
prayed <I>Maghrib</I> after it."
<P>
[Buthan is a wadi in Madina.]
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The prayer of the pursuer and the pursued by gesture while riding</B>
<P>
Al-Walid said, "I mentioned to al-Awza'i the fact that Shurahbil ibn as-Simt
and his companions had done the prayer on the backs of their animals and
he said, 'That is how it was with us when we were afraid of missing the prayer.'"
Al-Walid used as a proof the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, "No one should do pray <I>'Asr </I>before they get to Banu
Qurayza."
<P>
904. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "When the Prophet. may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, returned to us from the Battle of the Parties
(<I>Ahzab</I>), he said, 'No one should pray<I> 'Asr </I>before they get
to Banu Qurayza. For some of them <I>'Asr </I>became due on the way. Some
people said, 'We will not pray until we get there.' Others said, 'No, we
should do the prayer. That was not what he meant.' This was mentioned to
the Prophet and he did not rebuke any of them."
<P>
[This is the Battle of the Ditch.]
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The <I>takbir</I> and doing <I>Subh</I> while it is still dark. The
prayer at the time of attack and in battle</B>
<P>
905. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, prayed <I>Subh</I> while it was still dark,
then mounted his riding animal and said, "Allah is greater! Khaybar is destroyed.
When we alight in a people's square it is a bad morning for those who have
been warned.' The people came running out into the streets and saying, 'Muhammad
and the army!'(He said that <I>khamis</I> means army) The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, defeated them and their fighting
men were killed and children taken captive. Safiyya went first to Dihya al-Kalbi
and then to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
who then married her and made her bride-price her freedom."
<P>
'Abdu'l-'Aziz asked Thabit, "Abu Muhammad, did you ask Anas what her dower
was?" He replied, "Her dower was herself," and he smiled.

<B>I: The two<I> 'ids</I> and beautifying oneself on them</B>
<P>
906. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab took
a silk robe which was being sold in the market and brought it to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'Messenger of
Allah, if you were to buy this you could wear it on the day of Jumu'a and
to receive delegations.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to him, 'This will only be worn by someone who has
no share of the Next World.' As long as Allah willed later, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent a brocade robe to
'Umar and 'Umar brought it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah! You said, "This will
only be worn by someone who has no share of the Next World" and then you
send me this robe!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said to him, "You are to sell it or get what you need with it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Spears and shields on the Day of the <I>'Id</I></B>
<P>
907. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came to visit me when there were two slavegirls
with me singing about Bu'ath. He lay down on the bed and turned his face
away. Abu Bakr came and scolded me, saying, 'Musical instruments from Shaytan
in the presence of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!'
The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, turned to him and said, 'Leave
them be.' When (Abu Bakr) was not paying any attention, I signalled to them
and they went out. This was the day of the <I>'Id </I>and the black people
were playing a game with their spears and shields. Either I asked the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, or he himself said, 'Do you want
to have a look?' I said, 'Yes,' so he stood me behind him with my cheek against
his and said, 'Go on, Banu Arfida!' until I became bored. He said, 'Is that
enough for you?' I said, 'Yes' and he said, 'Go on then.'"

Banu Arfida means the Abyssinians.]
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The <I>sunna</I> of the two <I>'Ids </I>for the people of Islam</B>
<P>
908. It is related that al-Bara' said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, giving a <I>khutba</I> in which he said, 'The first
thing to be done on this day of ours is for us to pray and then we will return
and sacrifice. Whoever does this has followed our <I>sunna</I>.'"
<P>
909. It is related that 'A'isha' said, "Abu Bakr came in while there were
two slavegirls of the Ansar with me singing about what the Ansar had said
to each other on the Day of Bu'ath." She said, "They were not in fact singers
but Abu Bakr said, 'Musical instruments from Shaytan in the house of the
Messenger of Allah!' It was the day of the <I>'id</I> and the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Abu Bakr, every people
has an <I>'id </I>and this is our <I>'id</I>.'"
<P>
["They were not singers" means that it was not their profession and they
were not known for that.]
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Eating on the day of <I>'Id al-Fitr</I> before going out</B>
<P>
910. It is related that Anas said, "On the Day of Fitr, the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would not go out until he
had eaten some dates."
<P>
It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, used to eat an odd number of them.
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Eating on the Day of Sacrifice</B>
<P>
911. It is related that Anas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace,&nbsp;said, "Anyone who sacrifices before the prayer should
sacrifice again. A man stood up and said, 'This is a day when meat is desired,'
and he mentioned some of his neighbours. It seemed that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, agreed with what he said. The man said,
'I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep.'
So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave him the
dispensation of taking it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether the dispensation
extended to other than him or not."
<P>
912. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, addressed us on the Day of the Sacrifice after
the prayer. He said, 'Whoever prays as we pray and sacrifices as we sacrifice
has fulfilled the sacrifice. Whoever sacrifices before the prayer, it is
before the prayer and his sacrifice is invalid.'" Abu Burda ibn Dinar, the
uncle of al-Bara', said, "O Messenger of Allah, I sacrificed my sheep before
the prayer, knowing that today was a day of eating and drinking, and I wanted
my sheep to be the first to be sacrificed in my house. So I slaughtered my
sheep and ate before coming to the prayer." He said, "Your sheep is nothing
but mutton." Abu Burda said, "Messenger of Allah, I have a young she-goat
which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be enough for me?" He said,
"Yes, but it will not be enough for anyone after you."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Going out to the place of prayer without there being a minbar</B>
<P>
913. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "On the day of <I>Fitr</I>
and the day of <I>al-Adha</I>, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to go out to the place of the prayer. He would
start with the prayer first and then after finishing would stand in front
of the people who remained sitting in their rows. He would admonish and counsel
them and give them instructions. If he wanted to dispatch an expedition,
he would do so or if he wanted to command something, he commanded it. Then
he left."
<P>
Abu Sa'id said, "People continued in this way until the time I went out with
Marwan, the amir of Madina for <I>al-Adha </I>or <I>al-Fitr</I>. When we
reached the prayer place, there was a minbar which had been built by Kathir
ibn as-Salt. Marwan wanted to go up onto the minbar before he had done the
prayer. I grabbed him by his clothes but he pushed me away and went up and
gave the <I>khutba</I> before the prayer. I said to him, 'You have altered
things, by Allah!' He said, 'Abu Sa'id, what you knew has gone.' I said,
'By Allah, what I know is better than what I do not know.' He said, 'People
do not keep sitting down for us after the prayer and so I put it before the
prayer.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Walking and riding to the <I>'Id </I>and the prayer being before
the <I>khutba</I> without <I>adhan</I> or <I>iqama</I></B>
<P>
914. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray on the days of<I>
al-Adha</I> and<I> al-Fitr </I>and then deliver the <I>khutba</I> after the
prayer.
<P>
915. It is related that 'Ata' said, "I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out on the Day
of <I>Fitr</I> and did the prayer first before the <I>khutba</I>."
<P>
916. 'Ata' stated that Ibn 'Abbas sent a message to Ibn az-Zubayr when allegiance
was first given to him saying that there was no adhan for the prayer on the
Day of <I>Fitr</I> and that the <I>khutba</I> was after the prayer.
<P>
917. 'Ata' stated that Ibn 'Abbas and Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "There was
no <I>adhan</I> on the Day of <I>Fitr</I> or the Day of <I>Adha</I>."
<P>
918. Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, stood up and did the prayer first and then addressed
the people afterwards. When the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, finished, he came down and went to the women and reminded
them while leaning on Bilal's arm. Bilal had his garment outspread and the
women put <I>sadaqa</I> into it."
<P>
Ibn Jurayj said to 'Ata', "Do you think that it is incumbent on Imams today
to go to the women and remind them when they have finished?" 'Ata' said,
"It certainly is incumbent on them and why indeed do they not do it?"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The <I>khutba</I> after the <I>'Id </I>(prayer)</B>
<P>
919. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I attended th<I>e 'Id</I> with
the Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman and all of them did the
prayer before delivering the <I>khutba</I>."
<P>
920. It is related that ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr
and 'Umar did the prayer on both<I> 'Ids </I>before delivering the
<I>khutba</I>."
<P>
921. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> on the Day of <I>Fitr</I>
and did not pray before or after it. Then he went to the women with Bilal
and commanded them to give <I>sadaqa</I>. They began to to throw things in,
each woman throwing in her ear-rings and necklace."
<P>
922. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The first thing we do on this day of
ours is pray and then we go back and slaughter. Whoever does that has followed
our <I>Sunna</I>. Whoever sacrifices before the prayer, that is just meat
which he has presented to his family and it is not a <I>hajj</I> rite at
all." A man of the Ansar called Abu Burda ibn Niyar said, "Messenger of Allah,
I have already sacrificed but I also have a a one-year old she-goat which
is better than a two year old goat." He said, "Use that instead but it will
not suffice (or be enough) for anyone after you."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: It is disliked to carry weapons on the <I>'Id </I>and in the Haram</B>
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "People were forbidden to carry weapons on the day of the
'<I>Id </I>unless there was fear of an enemy."
<P>
923. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I was with Ibn 'Umar when
a spearhead went into the sole of his foot making his foot stick in the stirrup.
I dismounted and pulled it free. That happened at Mina. Al-Hajjaj heard about
it and came to visit him. Al-Hajjaj said, 'If only we knew who had wounded
you!' Ibn 'Umar said, 'You wounded me.' He said, 'How?' He said, 'You allowed
weapons to be carried on a day on which they may not be carried and you allowed
weapons to be brought into the Haram when weapons may not be brought into
the Haram.'"
<P>
924. It is related that Ishaq ibn Sa'id ibn 'Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As said
from his father, "Al-Hajjaj came to visit Ibn 'Umar while I was with him.
He said, 'How are you?' He said, 'Fine.' He asked, 'Who wounded you?' He
said, 'I was wounded by the person who commanded that weapons should be carried
on a day when it is not lawful for them to be carried,'" meaning al-Hajjaj
himself.
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Going out early to the <I>'Id</I></B>
<P>
'Abdullah ibn Yusr said, "We would finish at this time," and that was at
the time of <I>at-Tasbih</I> (about the time of Duha)."
<P>
925. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, addressed us on the Day of Sacrifice, 'The
first thing we do on this day of ours is pray and then we go back and slaughter.
Whoever does that has followed our Sunna. Whoever sacrifices before the prayer,
that is just meat which he has presented to his family and it is not a
<I>hajj</I> rite at all.' My uncle, Abu Burda ibn Niyar stood up and said,
'Messenger of Allah, I have already sacrificed but I also have a a one-year
old she-goat which is better than a two year old goat.' He said, 'Use that
instead but it will not suffice (or be enough) for anyone after you.'
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The excellence of right action during the days of tashriq</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "<I>'Mention Allah on known days' </I>refers to the first
ten days of Dhu'l-Hijja and the<I> 'numbered days' </I>are the days of
<I>Tashriq</I>." Ibn 'Umar and Abu Hurayra used to go the market during the
first ten days and say the <I>takbir</I> and people would say the
<I>takbir</I> after them. Muhammad ibn 'Ali said the <I>takbir</I> after
his supererogatory prayers.
<P>
926. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "No actions done during any ten days are better
than the actions done on these days." They said, "Not even <I>jihad</I>?"
He said, "Not even <I>jihad</I>, except for a man who goes out putting his
life and property in danger and returns with nothing."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Saying the <I>takbir</I> on the days of Mina and when going to
'Arafat</B>
<P>
'Umar used to say the <I>takbir</I> in his tent so that the people of the
mosque could hear him and they they and the people of the markets said the
takbir so that Mina vibrated with it. Ibn 'Umar used to say the <I>takbir</I>
at Mina on those days and after the prayers and also when he was in bed,
in his tent, while sitting and walking during every one of those days. Maymuna
used to say the <I>takbir</I> on the Day of Sacrifice. The women used to
say the <I>takbir</I> behind Aban ibn 'Uthman and 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz
with the men in the mosque during the nights of tashriq.
<P>
927. It is related that Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr ath-Thaqafi said, "Once when
we were coming from Mina to 'Arafat, I asked Anas about the <I>talbiya</I>
saying, 'What did you use to do when you were with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace?' He said, 'People would say the <I>talbiya</I>
and no objection was made, and people would say the <I>takbir</I> and no
objection was made.'"
<P>
928. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said, "We were ordered to come out on
the day of the<I> 'Id</I>, and even to bring out virgin girls from their
private quarters, and menstruating women as well, so that they could be behind
the rest of the people and say the <I>takbir</I> together with them and make
supplication together with them, hoping for the blessing of that day and
its purification."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Praying facing a spear on the day of th<I>e 'id</I></B>
<P>
929. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to stick a spear upright in front of him on the day
of <I>Fitr</I> and Sacrifice before doing the prayer.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Carrying a sharp stick or a spear in front of the Imam on the day
of the 'Id</B>
<P>
930. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet used to go out to the
place of prayer and a sharp stick was carried in front of him and placed
upright in front of him at the place of prayer and he would pray towards
it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Women and menstruating women going out to the place of prayer</B>
<P>
931. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said, "We were commanded to bring out
the older girls and those who remain in their private quarters."
<P>
Something similar is related from Hafsa. The <I>hadith</I> of Hafsa also
has, "The older girls and those who remain in their private quarters, but
menstruating women should keep away from the actual place of prayer."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Children going out to the place of prayer</B>
<P>
932. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas was heard to say, "I went with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of <I>Fitr</I> or
<I>Adha</I> and he did the prayer and then delivered the <I>khutba</I>. Then
he went to the women and warned and reminded them and commanded them to give
<I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: The Imam facing the people in the<I> 'Id khutba</I></B>
<P>
Abu Sa'id said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood
facing the people."
<P>
933. It is related that al-Bara' said, "On the day of <I>Adha</I>, the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to al-Baqi' and prayed
two <I>rak'ats</I>. Then he faced us and said, 'The first of our practices
on this day is to begin with the prayer and then we go back and sacrifice.
Whoever does that has acted in accordance with our <I>Sunna</I>. Whoever
sacrifices before that, it is just something he has hastened forward for
his family but in no way constitutes a sacrifice. A man stood up and said,
'Messenger of Allah, I have already sacrificed, but I have a yearling she-goat
which is better than a two year old goat.' He said, 'Sacrifice it but it
will not be enough for anyone after you.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: The sign indicating the place of prayer</B>
<P>
934. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Abis said, "I heard Ibn 'Abbas
being asked, 'Did you attend the <I>'Id </I>with the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace?' He said, 'Yes, and if it had not been that I was
young, I would not have attended. He reached the sign which was at the house
of Kathir ibn as-Salt and did the prayer and then he gave the <I>khutba</I>.
Then he went to the women with Bilal and admonished and reminded them and
commanded them to give <I>sadaqa</I>. I saw them putting it with their hands
into Bilal's garment. Then he and Bilal went to his house.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: The Imam preaching to the women on the day of the<I> 'Id</I></B>
<P>
935. It is related from 'Ata', "I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, 'The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up on the Day of <I>Fitr</I>
and prayed. He did the prayer first and then gave the <I>khutba</I>. When
he finished, he went to the women and reminded while leaning on Bilal's arm.
Bilal had his garment outspread and the women were putting <I>sadaqa</I>
in it.'"
<P>
Ibn Jurayj said, I asked 'Ata', 'The <I>zakat</I> of the day of<I>
al-Fitr</I>?' He said, 'No, rather <I>sadaqa</I> which they gave at that
time. One woman gave a silver ring and others also gave.' I said, 'Do you
think that it is incumbent on Imams today to go to the women and remind them
when they have finished?' 'Ata' said, 'It is certainly incumbent on them
and why indeed do they not do it?'"
<P>
936. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I attended the <I>'Id</I> with
the Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman &nbsp;and they performed
the prayer before the <I>khutba</I>. The <I>khutba</I> was delivered after
the prayer. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left, and
it is as if I could see him now, indicating with his hand that the people
should sit, and then went forward through the rows until he came to the women
and Bilal was with him. He said,<I> 'O Prophet, when believing women come
to you, swear fealty to you....' </I>(60:12) and when he finished, he asked,
'Does that apply to you?' One among them - and she was the only woman to
answer - said, 'Yes.' (Hasan did not know who she was.) He said, 'Then give
<I>sadaqa</I>.' Bilal spread out his garment. Then he said, 'Come on, may
my father and mother be your ransom!' They threw silver rings and seal rings
into Bilal's garment."
<P>
'Abdu'r-Razzaq said, "'<I>Fatakh</I>' are the large rings which were used
in the time of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: When a woman has no outer wrap for the <I>'Id</I></B>
<P>
937. It is related that Hafsa bint Sirin said, "We used to prevent our girls
from going out on the day of the<I> 'Id</I>. A woman came and stayed in the
fortress of Banu Khalaf and I went to her. She related that her sister's
husband had participated with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, in twelve expeditions and that her sister was with him on six
raids. She said, 'We used to look after the sick and treat the wounded.'
She said, 'Messenger of Allah, is there anything wrong if one of us does
not have an outer wrap and so does not come out (for the <I>'id</I>)?' He
said, 'Let her wear friend let her use some of her wrap. They should be present
at the good and the supplication of the believers.'"
<P>
Hafsa said, "When Umm 'Atiyya came, I went to her and asked her, 'Did you
hear anything about such-and-such?' She said, 'Yes, by my father. (Whenever
she mentioned the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, she said,
'By my father.') He said, "Let the mature girls who stay in their private
quarters (seclusion)" or he said, "mature girls and those who stay in their
private quarters (Ayyub was uncertain) come out. The menstruating women should
keep away from the place of prayer. They should be present at the good and
supplication of the believers."' I said to her, 'Menstruating women?' She
said, 'Yes, aren't menstruating women present at 'Arafat and present at
such-and-such and present at such-and-such?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: Menstruating women keeping away from the place of prayer</B>
<P>
938. From Umm 'Atiyya: "We were commanded to come out, and we came out -
the menstruating women, the mature girls and those who stay in their private
quarters " Ibn 'Awn said, "The mature girls who stay in their private quarters
(seclusion) The menstruating women should should be present at the gathering
and supplication of the Muslims, but should keep away from the place of prayer."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: Sacrifice and slaughter on the Day of Sacrifice at the place of
prayer</B>
<P>
939. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to sacrifice or slaughter at the place of prayer.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: The words of the Imam and the people during the<I> 'Id khutba</I>.
When the Imam is asked about something while he is giving the
<I>khutba</I></B>
<P>
940. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, addressed us on the Day of the Sacrifice after
the prayer. He said, 'Whoever prays as we pray and sacrifices as we sacrifice
has fulfilled the sacrifice. Whoever sacrifices before the prayer, that is
mutton.' Abu Burda ibn Dinar stood up and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, I
sacrificed my sheep before the prayer, knowing that today was a day of eating
and drinking,and I made haste and ate and fed my family and neighbours.'
He said, "Your sheep is nothing but mutton." Abu Burda said, "Messenger of
Allah, I have a young she-goat which is better than two sheep. Will that
be enough for me?" He said, "Yes, but it will not be enough for anyone after
you."
<P>
941. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, did the prayer on the Day of Sacrifice
and then gave a <I>khutba</I> and commanded that whoever had sacrificed before
the prayer should repeat his sacrifice. A man of the Ansar stood up and said,
'Messenger of Allah, I have some neighbours - and he said of them either
that they were very needy or poor - so I sacrificed before the prayer. But
I have a young she-goat whose flesh is dearer to me than that of two sheep.'
So he allowed him to do it."
<P>
942. It is related that Jundab said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, did the prayer on the Day of Sacrifice and then gave the
<I>khutba</I> and sacrificed. He said, 'Any one who has sacrificed before
praying should sacrifice another in its place and any one who has not yet
sacrificed should do so in the name of Allah.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: Someone using a different route to return on the day of the
<I>'id</I></B>
<P>
943. It is related that Jabir said, "On the day of the<I> 'id</I>, the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would return by a different route."
<P>
Abu Hurayra corroborated it but the <I>hadith</I> of Jabir is sounder.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: When someone misses the<I> 'Id</I>, he should pray two
<I>rak'ats</I>. It is the same for women and those who remain at home or
in their villages</B>
<P>
This is based on the statement of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, "This is our <I>'Id</I>, people of Islam."
<P>
Anas ibn Malik ordered his client, Ibn Abi 'Utba at az-Zawiya to gather together
his family and sons. He did the prayer and takbir in the same way as the
people of the city. 'Ikrima said, "Country people should gather to pray two<I>
rak'ats</I> on th<I>e 'id </I>as the Imam does." 'Ata' says, "If someone
misses the prayer, he should pray two <I>rak'ats</I>."
<P>
944. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Abu Bakr came in when there were two
slavegirls with me playing musical instruments while the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was wrapped in his garment. Abu Bakr scolded
them and the Prophet* unwrapped himself and said, 'Let them be, Abu Bakr.
It is the<I> 'Id</I> and these are the days of Mina.'"
<P>
'A'isha said, "I was with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, when he shielded me while I was watching the Abyssinians playing in
the mosque. 'Umar rebuked them and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Let them be. You are safe, Banu Arfida!'meaning under
protection."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: Praying before and after the <I>'Id</I></B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that it is disliked to pray before the <I>'Id.</I>
<P>
945. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went out on the day of <I>Fitr</I> and prayed two<I>
rak'ats</I> and did not pray before or after it. Bilal was with him.

Prayer</A></BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: What has come about the <I>Witr</I></B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#13">946</A>. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that a man asked
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about the
night prayer and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, "Night prayers are two by two, and when you are afraid that
the dawn is approaching, then pray one rak'at as <I>witr</I> to make what
you have prayed odd."
<P>
It is related that Ibn 'Umar used to say a <I>taslim</I> between the two
<I>rak'ats </I>and the single <I>rak'at </I>of the <I>Witr</I> so that he
could do anything he needed to do.
<P>
947. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas stated that he spent the night in the
house of Maymuna, his aunt. He said, "I lay down crossways on the bed, and
the Messenger of Allah and his wife lay down lengthways on it. He slept until
halfway through the night or close to it when he awoke and wiped away the
sleep from his face. Then, after reciting ten verses from Ali 'Imran, the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and went
over to a water-skin which was hanging up and did wudu', doing it thoroughly.
Then he stood up to pray and I did the same, going to stand at his side.
He put his right hand on my head and tweaked my ear. Then he prayed two
<I>rak'ats</I>, then two <I>rak'ats</I>, then two <I>rak'ats</I>, then two
<I>rak'ats</I>, then two<I> rak'ats</I>, then two<I> rak'ats</I>, and then
the <I>witr</I>. Then he lay down until the <I>mu'adhdhin</I> came to him.
He got up and prayed two <I>rak'ats </I>and then went out and prayed
<I>Subh</I>."
<P>
948. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The night prayers are two by two. When
you want to finish, then pray one <I>rak'at </I>as <I>witr</I>."
<P>
Al-Qasim said, "Since we reached puberty, we have seen some people doing
the <I>witr</I> with three consecutive<I> rak'ats. </I>Everything is possible.
I hope that there is no harm in it."
<P>
949. It is related from 'A'isha, "The Messenger of Allah used to pray eleven<I>
rak'ats</I>. Such was his prayer - meaning during the night. And he would
stay in <I>sajda</I> in them for as long as it takes someone to recite fifty
<I>ayats</I>, before lifting his head. He used to do two <I>rak'ats </I>before
the <I>Fajr</I> prayer and then lie down on his right side until the
<I>mu'adhdhin</I> came for the prayer."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The time of the <I>witr</I></B>
<P>
Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet told me to pray the <I>witr</I> before going
to sleep."
<P>
950. It is related that Anas ibn Sirin said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar, 'What do
you think about the two <I>rak'ats </I>before the morning prayer? Should
the recitation in them be long?' He said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to pray the night prayers two by two and then do
the witr with one <I>rak'at</I>. He would pray two<I> rak'ats </I>before
the morning prayer with the <I>adhan</I> still echoing in his ears.'"
<P>
Hammad said that this means "quickly".
<P>
951. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to do the witr every night and the latest
he did it was in the time just before dawn."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The Prophet waking up his family for the witr</B>
<P>
952. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, would pray with me lying across his bed asleep. When the
time came for him to do the witr, he would wake me up and I would do the
<I>witr</I> as well."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Making the last prayer the <I>witr</I></B>
<P>
953. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Make the last of your prayers at night the
<I>witr</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Doing the <I>witr</I> on an animal</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#15">954</A>. It is related that Sa'id ibn Yasar said,
"I was travelling on the way to Makka with 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar." Sa'id continued,
"When I feared that morning was coming, I dismounted, did the <I>witr</I>
and then caught up with him. 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, 'Where were you?'
I said, 'I feared that morning was coming and so I did the <I>witr</I>.'
'Abdullah said, 'Do you not have a good enough example in the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' I said, 'Yes, by Allah!'
He said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to do the <I>witr</I> on his camel.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The <I>witr</I> while travelling</B>
<P>
955. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "While travelling, the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray the night prayers, but
not the obligatory prayers, by gesture on his camel whichever way it was
facing. He also used to do the <I>witr</I> on his camel."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The <I>Qunut</I> before and after<I> ruku'</I></B>
<P>
956. It is related that Muhammad (ibn Sirin) said, "Anas was asked, 'Did
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do the <I>qunut</I>
in <I>Subh</I>?' He said, 'Yes.' He was asked, 'Did he do the <I>qunut</I>
before <I>ruku'</I>?' He said, 'For a time he did <I>qunut</I> after
<I>ruku</I>'.'"
<P>
957. It is related that 'Asim said, "I asked Anas ibn Malik about the
<I>qunut</I> and he said, 'The <I>qunut</I> definitely used to be done.'
I said, 'Before or after <I>ruku'</I>?' He said, 'Before it.'" He said, "Someone
told me that you said it was done after <I>ruku</I>'. He said, 'He lied.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, only did
the <I>qunut</I> after <I>ruku' </I>for a month. I think that he sent out
a group of people called " the reciters" numbering about seventy men to a
group of idolaters numbering less than them who had a treaty with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did the <I>qunut</I> for a month
to make supplication against them.'"
<P>
958. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, did the <I>qunut</I> for a month making supplication against
the tribes of &nbsp;Ri'l and Dhakwan."
<P>
959. It is related that Anas said, "The <I>qunut</I> was done in the prayers
of <I>Maghrib</I> and <I>Fajr</I>."
