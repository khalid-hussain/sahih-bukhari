Expeditions</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: The excellence of <I>jihad</I> and military expeditions</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Allah has bought from the believers their
selves and their wealth in return for them having the Garden. They fight
in the way of Allah, and they kill and are killed. It is a promise binding
on Him in the Torah, the Injil and the Qur'an and who is truer to his contract
than Allah? Rejoice then in the bargain you have made. That is the great
victory. Those who turn in repentance, those who worship, those who praise,
those who fast, those who bow, those who prostrate, those who command the
right, those who forbid the wrong, those who preserve the limits of Allah:
give good news to the believers." </I>(9:111-112) Ibn 'Abbas said that the
"limits" (<I>hudud</I>) is obedience.
<P>
2630. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "I asked the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Messenger of Allah, which
action is best?' He replied, 'The prayer at its proper time.' I asked, 'Then
what?' He answered, 'Then devotion to parents.' I asked, 'Then what?' He
said, <I>Jihad</I> in the way of Allah.' Then I was silent and stopped asking
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, but if I
had asked for more, he would have told me more."
<P>
2631. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is no <I>hijra</I> after
the Conquest of Makka, but there is jihad and intention. When you are called
upon to fight, then go forth."
<P>
2632. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Messenger of Allah, we see that
<I>jihad</I> is the best action so should we not do jihad?" He replied, "Rather
the best <I>jihad</I> is an accepted hajj."
<P>
2633. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man came to the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Direct me to an
action which is equal to <I>jihad</I>.' He said, 'I do not find any.' He
added, 'When the one doing jihad sets out, can you then enter your mosque
and pray without stopping and fast without breaking the fast?' He asked,
'Who can do that?'" Abu Hurayra said, "Good deeds are written for the one
going on <I>jihad</I> for the steps his horse takes while grazing tied by
its rope."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The best of people is the believer who does <I>jihad</I> with his
person and his property in the Way of Allah</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"O you who believe! Shall I direct you to
a transaction which will save you from a painful punishment? That you believe
in Allah and His Messenger and do jihad in the Way of Allah with your wealth
and yourselves. That is better for you if you only knew. He will forgive
you your wrong actions and admit you into Gardens with rivers flowing under
them, and fine dwellings in the Gardens of Eden. That is the Great Victory."
</I>(61:10-12)
<P>
2634. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "It was asked, 'Messenger
of Allah, who is the best of people?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, replied, 'A believer who does jihad in the way of
Allah with his person and his wealth.' They asked, 'Then who?' He answered,
'A believer in one of the mountain ravines who is fearful of Allah and spares
people of his evil.'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#1">2635</A>. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The
likeness of someone who does jihad in the Way of Allah - and Allah knows
best the one who does jihad in His Way - is like someone who fasts and prays
constantly, and Allah guarantees for the one who does jihad in His way that
if He dies, He will admit him into the Garden, or else he will either return
whole with reward or booty."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Supplication for jihad and martyrdom for both men and women</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "O Allah, provide me with martyrdom in the land of Your
Messenger!"
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#39">2636</A>. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard
to say, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to visit Umm Haram bint Milhan and she would feed him. Umm Haram was
married to 'Ubada ibn as-Samit. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, visited her and she fed him and began to delouse his
head. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went
to sleep and then woke up smiling. She said, 'I said, "What made you smile,
Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Some people from my community who were shown
me raiding in the way of Allah, riding the middle of this sea like kings
on throne" (or like the kings on the thrones - Ishaq was unsure)."' She said,
'I said, "Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!"' So the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made supplication for
her. 'Then he put his head down and then woke up smiling. I said, "What made
you smile, Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Some people from my community who
were shown me raiding in the way of Allah," as he said the first time.' She
said, 'I said, "Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!" He said,
"You are among the first.'" She embarked on the sea in the time of Mu'awiya
ibn Abi Sufyan and was thrown from her animal when she left the sea and was
killed."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The degrees of those doing <I>jihad</I> in the way of Allah</B>. (One
says "this is my way" in either the feminine or masculine.)
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said that the singular of <I>ghuza</I> (3:156) is
<I>gh&acirc;z&icirc;</I>. <I>"They are degrees" </I>(3:163) is "they have
degrees."
<P>
2637. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone believes in Allah and His
Messenger and establishes the prayer and fasts Ramadan, it is mandatory for
Allah to admit him to the Garden, whether he does jihad in the Way of Allah
or sits in the land where he was born." They asked, "Messenger of Allah,
shall we give the people the good news?" He said, "In the Garden there are
a hundred degrees which Allah has prepared for those who do jihad in the
way of Allah. Between each two degrees is the space between heaven and earth.
When you ask Allah, ask Him for Firdaws which is in the middle of the Garden
and the top of the Garden." I think that he said, "above the Throne of the
All-Merciful and from it spring the rivers of the Garden."
<P>
Muhammad ibn Fulayj said from his father, "Above it is the Throne of the
All-Merciful."
<P>
2638. It is related from Samura that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "I dreamt in the night that two men came to me and
climbed the tree and admitted me into the most beautiful and excellent house
and I have never seen any more beautiful than it. They said, 'This house
is the house of the martyrs.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Morning and evening in the way of Allah. A bow 's length of one of
you in the Garden</B>
<P>
2639. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "A morning spent in the way of Allah or an
evening is better than this world and everything it contains."
<P>
2640. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace,said, "A bow's length of the Garden is better than everything
on which the sun rises and sets," and he said, "A morning or evening in the
way of Allah is better than that on which the sun rises and sets."
<P>
2641. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "A morning or an evening spent in the way
of Allah is better than this world and everything it contains."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The wide-eyed houris and their description. The eye is bewildered
by them and the contrast of intense blackness and whiteness in their eyes</B>
<P>
<I>"We married them" </I>(44:54) means "We gave them in marriage".
<P>
2642. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "There is no one who has died and found good
with Allah who would be happy to return to this world, even if he were to
have this world and what is in it , except for the martyr. When he sees the
virtue of martyrdom, he would be happy to return to his world and be killed
again."
<P>
2643. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "An evening spent in the way of Allah or an
morning is better than this world and everything it contains. The amount
of a bow's length of one of you in the Garden - or the place of his lash,
i.e. his whip - is better than this world and what is contains. If a woman
of the people of the Garden were to appear to the people of the earth, she
would illuminate what is between the heaven and the earth and will it with
fragrance. The scarf on her head is better than this world and what is contains."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Wishing for martyrdom</B>
<P>
2644. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, 'By the One in whose hand my soul is,
if it were not that there are men among the believers who would not be happy
to stay behind me and I have not got the wherewithal to provide them with
mounts, I would never stay behind from any expedition in the Way of Allah.
By the One in whose hand my soul is, I would love to be killed in the way
of Allah and then be brought to life, and then be killed and then be brought
to life, and then be killed and then brought to life, and then be killed
again."
<P>
2645. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, gave a speech and said, "Zayd took the standard
and was struck down. Then Ja'far took it and was struck down. Then 'Abdullah
ibn Rawaha took it and was struck down. Then Khalid ibn al-Walid took it
without being appointed commander and was given victory.' He further said,
'It would not make us happy to have them with us.'" Ayyub said, "Or he said,
'It would not make them happy to be with us,' and his eyes were weeping."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The excellence of the one who is thrown while going out in the Way
of Allah and dies. He is one of the martyrs</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"If anyone leaves his home, emigrating to
Allah and His Messenger, and death catches up with him, it is Allah who will
reward him." </I>(4:110)
<P>
2646. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that his aunt, Umm Haram bint Milham
said "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to sleep
one day when he was near me and then woke up smiling. I said, 'What made
you smile?' He said, 'Some people from my community were shown to me raiding
in the way of Allah, riding this green sea like kings on thrones.'" She said,
"Ask Allah to put me among them!" So he made supplication for her. Then he
went to sleep a second time and did the like of it and she said the like
of what she had said and he gave her a similar answer. She said, "Ask Allah
to put me among them!" He said, "You are among the first.'" She went out
with her husband, 'Ubada ibn as-Samit, on an expedition and was the first
of the Muslims to embark on the sea with Mu'awiya. When they finished their
expedition and were returning, they stopped in Syria. An animal was brought
for her to ride and it threw her off and she died.
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: The one injured in the way of Allah</B>
<P>
2647. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, sent some seventy &nbsp;men from the Banu Sulaym to the
Banu 'Amir. When they arrived, my uncle said to them, 'I will go ahead of
you. If they grant me security so that I can convey the message of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, (that will be fine.) Otherwise
you will be near me.' He went forward and they gave him security. While he
was conveying to them the message of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, they made a gesture to one of their men and he attacked
him and stabbed him through. He said, 'Allah is greater! By the Lord of the
Ka'ba, I have won!' Then they attacked the rest of his companions and killed
them except for a lame man who climbed the mountain. (Hammam said, "I think
there was another man with him.") Jibril, peace be upon him, informed the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that they had met their
Lord and He was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. We used
to recite, 'Convey to our people that we have met our Lord and He is pleased
with us and We are pleased' until it was abrogated later. He cursed them
for forty mornings - Ri'l, Dhakwan, Banu Lihyan and Banu 'Usayya who disobeyed
Allah and His Messenger."
<P>
[These were the Ansar who were sent to teach the Qur'an and call the people
of Najd to Islam. This took place at Bi'r Ma'una. The cursing took place
in the qunut in the <I>Fajr</I> prayer.]
<P>
2648. It is related from Jundub ibn Sufyan that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on a certain expedition and his
finger was injured and he said, "Are you anything but a finger that is injured?
And what you have met is in the Cause of Allah."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The one who goes out in the way of Allah, the Mighty and Exalted</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#29">2649</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "By the
One who has my soul in His hand, anyone who is wounded in the Way of Allah
- and Allah knows best the one who is wounded in His Way - will come on the
Day of Rising with his wound bleeding. It will be the colour of blood but
have the scent of musk."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The words of Allah Almighty, "What do you await for us except for
one of the two best things?" (9:52) War has its ups and downs</B>
<P>
<B> </B>2650. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that Abu Sufyan informed him
that Heraclius had said to him, "I asked you how your fight against him went,
and you claimed that the war had its ups and downs and success alternated.
That is how the Messengers are tested, and then they have the final victory."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Among the believers there are men
who have been true to the contract they made with Allah. Some of them have
fulfilled their pact by death and some are still waiting to do so and have
not changed in any way at all." </I>(33:23)</B>
<P>
2651. It is related that Anas said, "My uncle, Anas ibn an-Nadr, missed the
fighting at Badr and said, 'Messenger of Allah, I missed the first battle
in which you fought the idolaters. If Allah gives me the opportunity to fight
the idolaters, Allah will see what I shall do!' On the Day of Uhud, the Muslims
were routed and he said, 'O Allah, I apologise to You for what these people
have done (i.e. his companions) and I declare myself innocent to You of what
those people have done, (i.e. the idolaters).' Then he went forward and Sa'd
ibn Mu'adh met him. He said, 'O Sa'd ibn Mu'adh! The Garden, by the Lord
of the Ka'ba! I smell its fragrance from below Uhud!' Sa'd said, 'Messenger
of Allah, I could not do what he did.'" Anas said, "We found him with about
eighty wounds, sword thrusts or spear stabs or arrows. We found that he had
been killed and the idolaters had mutiliated him. No one could recognise
him except for his sister by his fingertips." Anas said, "We used to think
or suppose that this <I>ayat</I> was sent down about him and his like, 'Among
the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah.'"
<P>
He said, "His sister, who was called ar-Rubayyi', broke a girl's tooth and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commaned
retaliation. Anas said, 'Messenger of Allah, by the One who sent you with
the truth, her tooth will not be broken!' Then the people were content with
compensation and forwent retaliation, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'There are some of the slaves of Allah
who, if they swear an oath, Allah will carry it out.'"
<P>
2652. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "I copied out the papers into
the pages and I missed one <I>ayat</I> of <I>Surat al-Ahzab</I> which I used
to hear the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
recite. I only found it with Khuzayma ibn Thabit al-Ansari whose testimony
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had made
equal to the testimony of two men. It is His words, <I>'Among the believers
there are men who have been true to the contract they made with Allah.'</I>"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Righteous action before fighting</B>
<P>
Abu'd-Darda' said, "You fight according to your actions."
<P>
The words of Allah,<I> "O you who believe! Why do you say what you do not
do? It is abhorrent to Allah that you should say what you do not do. Allah
loves those who fight in His Way in ranks like well-built walls." </I>(61:2-3)
<P>
2653. It is related that al-Bara' said, "A man bristling with armour came
to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger
of Allah, shall I fight or become Muslim?' He said, 'Become Muslim and then
fight.' He became Muslim and then fought and was killed.' The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'His action was little
but his reward is great.'"
<P>
[It was 'Amr ibn Thabit al-Ashhali.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: The one who is struck and killed by an arrow shot by an unknown
person</B>
<P>
2654. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that Umm ar-Rubayyi' bint al-Bara',
the mother of al-Haritha ibn Suraqa, came to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and said, "O Prophet of Allah, Will you not tell
me about Haritha?" He had been killed at the Battle of Badr and had been
struck by an arrow from an unknown person. "If he is in the Garden, I will
be patient. If the case is other than that, I will weep my eyes out for him."
He said, "Umm Haritha, there are many gardens within the Garden, and your
son has obtained the Highest Paradise."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: The one who fights so that the word of Allah will be uppermost</B>
<P>
2655. It is related that Abu Musa said, "A man came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'One man fights for booty, and one
man fights for renown, and another fights so that his position will be seen.
Who is truly in the way of Allah?' He said, 'The one who fights so that the
Word of Allah will be the uppermost is fighting in the way of Allah.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: The one whose feet become dusty in the way of Allah</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"It was not for people of Madina, and the
desert Arabs around them, to remain behind the Messenger of Allah nor to
prefer themselves to him. That is because no thirst or weariness or hunger
will afflict them in the Way of Allah, nor will they take a single step to
infuriate the rejectors, nor secure any gain from the enemy, without a right
action being written down for them because of it. Allah does not let the
wage of the good-doers go to waste." </I>(9:120)
<P>
2656. It is related that Abu 'Abs, who is 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Jabr that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Fire
will not touch anyone whose feet become dusty in the way of Allah "
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Wiping the dust from people in the road</B>
<P>
2657. It is related from 'Ikrima that Ibn 'Abbas said to him and 'Abdullah
ibn 'Ali, "'Go to Abu Sa'id and listen to some of his <I>hadith</I>.' We
went to him and he and his brother were watering their garden. When he saw
us, he sat down, wrapping his legs in his cloak. He said, 'We were carrying
one brick of the mosque at a time but 'Ammar carried two at a time. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, passed by him and brushed the dust
from his head, saying, "Alas for 'Ammar! An unjust party will kill him while
'Ammar is calling them to the Garden and they are calling him to the Fire."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Having a bath after war and dust</B>
<P>
2658. It is related from 'A'isha that when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, returned on the Day of Ditch and put down
his weapons and washed, Jibril came to him with his head covered in dust.
He said, 'You have put down your arms. By Allah, I have not put mine down.'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'Where
then?' He said, 'Here,' and appointed towards the Banu Qurayza." She said,
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out
to them."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: The excellence of the words of Allah Almighty:</B>
<P>
<I>"Do not suppose that those killed in the Way of Allah are dead. No indeed!
They are alive and well provided for in the very presence of their Lord,
delighting in the favour Allah has bestowed on them, rejoicing over those
they left behind who have not yet joined them, feeling no fear and knowing
no sorrow, rejoicing in blessings and favour from Allah and that Allah does
not let the wage of the believers go to waste.</I>" (2:169-171)
<P>
2659. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, cursed those who killed the people at
Bi'r Ma'una for thirty morning - against Ri'l, Dhakwan and 'Usayya who had
disobeyed Allah and His Messenger."
<P>
Anas said, "''Convey to our people that we have met our Lord and He is pleased
with us and We are pleased' was sent down about those killed at Bi'r Ma'una
and then it was abrogated later."
<P>
2660. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "Some people drank wine
in the morning of the Battle of Uhud and then were killed as martyrs." Sufyan
was asked, "Were they killed at the end of that day?" He said, "It does not
say in it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: The angels' shading the martyr</B>
<P>
2661. It is related that Jabir was heard to say, "My father was brought to
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he had been mutilated.
He was placed before him and He was placed before him I went to uncover his
face and some people prevented me. He heard the sound of a woman crying out
and was told that it was 'Amr's daughter or 'Amr's sister. He said, 'Why
is she is weeping? - or "she should not weep" - The angels are still covering
him with their wings.'" I [al-Bukhari] said to Sadaqa, "Is 'until he is lifted
up' in it?" He said, "He may have said it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: The wish of the mujahid to be returned to this world</B>
<P>
2662. It is related from Anas ibn Malik &#163; that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "No one will enter the Garden and then
want to return to this world, even if he had everything that is on the earth,
except for a martyr who wants to return to this world and be killed ten times
more because of the honour he experiences."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: The Garden is under the blades of the swords</B>
<P>
Al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said, "Our Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, reported to us from the message of our Lord, 'Whoever of us is killed
will go to the Garden."
<P>
'Umar asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Are not
those of us killed in the Garden and those of them killed in the Fire?" He
replied, "Yes indeed."
<P>
2663. It is related from Salim Abu'n-Nadr, the client of 'Umar ibn 'Ubaydullah,
who was his scribe, "'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa wrote to us that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said, 'Know that the
Garden is under the shadow of the swords."
<P>
Al-Uwaysi corroborated it from Abu'z-Zinad from Musa ibn 'Uqba.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: The one who asks for a child to do <I>jihad</I></B>
<P>
2664. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Sulayman, son of Da'ud, peace be upon
them both, said, 'I will go around tonight to a hundred - or ninety-nine
- wives and each of them will produce a warrior who will fight in the way
of Allah.' His companion said to him, 'Say, "Allah willing."' He did not
say 'Allah willing.' So only one woman of them became pregnant and she produced
half a man. By the One who has the soul of Muhammad in His hand, if he had
said, 'Allah willing', they would have all been warriors striving in the
way of Allah.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: Courage and cowardice in war</B>
<P>
2665. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was the best of people, the bravest of people, and the most
generous of people. The people of Madina were alarmed and the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was the first of them on a horse and
he said, 'We found it like a sea [in the speed of its gait].'"
<P>
2666. It is related from Jubayr ibn Mut'im that while he was travelling with
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with some
people, returning from Hunayn, some people began to cling to him asking him
until they forced him back against an acacia tree and his cloak was snatched
away. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stopped and said,
"Give me my cloak. If I had had camels as numerous as these trees, I would
have divided them between you and then you will not find me to be a miser,
a liar nor a coward."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: Seeking refuge from cowardice</B>
<P>
2667. It is related that 'Amr ibn Maymun al-Azdi said, "Sa'd used to teach
his sons these words as a teacher would teach boys to write. He said that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
seek refuge from them after the prayer, 'O Allah, I seek refuge with You
from cowardice and I seek refuge with You from reverting to the basest stage
of life and I seek refuge with You fro the temptation of this world, and
I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave.'"
<P>
2668. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, "O Allah, I seek refuge
with You from incapacity and laziness, cowardice and senility. I seek refuge
with You from the trial of life and death, and I seek refuge with You from
the punishment of the grave."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: The one who reported what he witnessed in battle</B>
<P>
Abu 'Uthman reported it from Sa'd.
<P>
2669. It is related that as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid said, "I accompanied Talha ibn
'Ubaydullah, Sa'd, al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Awf and
I did not hear any of them relate &nbsp;anything from the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, except that I heard Talha reporting
about the Battle of Uhud."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: The obligatory nature of the call to fight and what is obligatory
in <I>jihad</I> and intention</B>
<P>
The words of Allah<I>, "Go out to fight, whatever your circumstances or desires,
and do jihad with your wealth and yourselves in the way of Allah. That is
better for you if you only knew. If it had been a case of easy gains and
a short journey, they would have followed you, but the distance was too great
for them. They will swear by Allah: 'Had we been able to, we would have gone
out with you.' They are destroying their own selves. Allah knows that they
are lying." </I>(9:41-42)
<P>
And His words,<I> "O you who believe, what is wrong with you that when you
are told, 'Go out and fight in the way of Allah,' you sink down heavily to
the earth? Are you happier with the life of this world than the Next World?
Yet the enjoyment of the life of this world is tiny compared to the Next
World. If you do not go out to fight, He will punish you with a painful
punishment and replace you with another people. You will not harm Him in
any way. Allah has power over all things." </I>(9:38-39)
<P>
It is mentioned from Ibn 'Abbas that <I>"Go out to fight in separate groups"
</I>(4:71) refers to separate expeditions. The singular of <I>thubat</I>
is <I>thubba</I>.
<P>
2670. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said on the Day of the Conquest,
"There is no hijra after the Conquest of Makka, but there is jihad and intention.
When you are called upon to fight, then go forth."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: An unbeliever who kills a Muslim and then becomes Muslim, directs
himself to good, and then is killed</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#28">2671</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah
laughs about two men, one of whom kills the other and yet both of them enter
the Garden. One fights in the way of Allah and is killed. Then Allah turns
towards the killer, who then becomes Muslim himself and is martyred."
<P>
2672. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I went to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he was at Khaybar after they
had conquered it and said, 'Messenger of Allah, give me a share.' One of
the sons of Sa'id ibn al-'As said, 'Do not give him a share, Messenger of
Allah.'" Abu Hurayra said, "'This one murdered Ibn Qawqal!' The son of Sa'id
ibn al-'As said, 'Wonder! A desert weasel slips down to us from Qadum Da'n,
blaming me for killing a Muslim man whom Allah has honoured at my hands and
who did not disgrace me at his hands.'" He said, "I do not know whether he
gave him a share or not."
<P>
Another isnad from Abu Hurayra. Abu 'Abdullah said that as-Sa'idi (in the
<I>isnad</I>) is 'Amr ibn Yahya ibn Sa'id ibn 'Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: The one who prefers expeditions to fasting</B>
<P>
2673. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "Abu Talha used to not fast
in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, because
of going on expeditions. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, died, I did not see him not fasting except for the day of <I>'Id
al-Fitr </I>and <I>'Id al-Adha</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: Martyrdom applies to seven categories other than those killed
(fighting)</B>
<P>
2674. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are five categories of martyr:
someone killed by the plague, someone killed by an abdominal disease, someone
who drowns, someone who is killed by a collapsing building and the martyr
killed fighting in the way of Allah."
<P>
2675. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The plague is martyrdom for every Muslim."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXI: The words of Allah Almighty<I>:</I></B>
<P>
<I>"Those believers who stay behind &#150; other than those forced by necessity
&#150; are not the same as those who do jihad in the way of Allah, sacrificing
their wealth and themselves. Allah has given those who do jihad with their
wealth and themselves a higher rank than those who stay behind. Allah has
promised the Best to both, but Allah has preferred those who do jihad over
those who stay behind by an immense reward: high ranks conferred by Him as
well as forgiveness and mercy. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
</I>(4:95-96)
<P>
2676. It is related that al-Bara' said, "When '<I>Those believers who stay
behind</I> <I>are not the same</I>' was sent down, the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, summoned Zayd and he brought a
shoulder-blade and wrote it down. Ibn Umm Maktum complained of his blindness
and there was sent down, '<I>Those believers who stay behind</I> <I>&#150;
other than those forced by necessity &#150; are not the same</I>.'"
<P>
2677. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi said, "I saw Marwan ibn
al-Hakam sitting in the mosque and I went towards him and sat by his side.
He informed us that Zayd ibn Thabit had informed him that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, dictated to him, '<I>Those
believers who stay behind</I> <I>are not the same as those who do jihad in
the way of Allah</I>.' Ibn Umm Maktum came to him while he was dictating
it and said, 'Messenger of Allah, if I was able to go on <I>jihad</I>, I
would go on <I>jihad</I>!' He was a blind man. Then Allah, the Blessed and
Exalted, sent down on His Messenger, and his thigh was against my thigh and
it became so heavy for me that I feared my thigh would break. Then it left
him and Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, had sent down, '<I>other than those
forced by necessity</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXII: Steadfastness in fighting</B>
<P>
2678. It is related from Salim Abu'n-Nadr that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa wrote,
and I read it, that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, had said, "When you meet them, be steadfast."
<P>

<P>
2679. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went out to the Ditch when the Muhajirun and Ansar
were digging on a cold morning. They did not have any servants to do that
for them. When he saw their fatigue and hunger, he said, 'O Allah, The real
life is the life of the Next World, so forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirun!'
They said in reply to him:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'We are those who have given allegiance to Muhammad
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; to always fight in jihad as long as we live!'"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIV: Digging the Ditch</B>
<P>
2680. It is related that Anas said, "The Muhajirun and the Ansar began digging
the Ditch around Madina and remove the dirt on their backs, saying:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'We are those who have given allegiance to Muhammad
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;to always be Muslims as long as we live!'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, answered them, saying,
'O Allah, there is no good but the good of the Next World, so bless the Ansar
and the Muhajirun!'"
<P>
2681. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was carrying (earth) and saying, 'If it had not been
for You, we would not have guided.'"
<P>
2682. It is related that al-Bara' said, "On the Day of the Confederates [i.e.the
Ditch] I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
moving earth and the dust covered the white of his belly. He was saying,
'If it had not been for You, we would not have been guided nor given
<I>sadaqa</I> nor fasted, so send down tranquillity on us and make our feet
firm when we meet [the enemy].Those have wronged and attacked us, but we
refused when they desired to tempt us.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXV: The one prevented from raiding by an excuse</B>

with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
2684. It is related from Anas that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was on an expedition and said, "There are people who have stayed
behind us in Madina. We have not travelled through any ravine nor valley
but that they are with us. They were held back by an excuse."
<P>
Another <I>isnad</I>. Abu 'Abdullah &nbsp;[al-Bukhari] said that the first
is sounder.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVI: The excellence of fasting while [doing jihad] in the way of Allah</B>
<P>
2685. It is related from Abu Sa'id that he heard the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, "If someone fasts a day in the Way of Allah,
Allah will put seventy years distance between his face and the Fire."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: The excellence of spending in the way of Allah</B>
<P>
2686. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "If someone&nbsp;spends two things in the way
of Allah, the guardians of the Garden, every guardian of a gate, call to
him, 'O so-and-so! Come!' Abu Bakr said, 'Messenger of Allah, that is the
one who will not be destroyed!' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'I hope that you will be one of them.'"
<P>
2687. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood on the minbar and said, "After
me, I fear for you the blessings of the earth which will be opened to you.'
Then he mentioned the attractions of this world and began with one of them
and then mentioned the second. A man stood up and asked, "Messenger of Allah,
can good bring evil?" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was silent about it. We said, "He is being given revelation," and the people
were silent as if there were birds on their heads. Then he wiped the sweat
from his face and said, "Where is the one asked the question? Is good wealth?
- three times - Good only brings good. It is like that which grows on the
water course and nearly kills or nearly kills by bloating. The animal eats
the plants until its sides are full and then it faces the sun and defecates
and urinates and then grazes. This property is sweet and green. How excellent
is the Muslim who takes it with its due and puts it in the way of Allah,
the orphans and poor. The one who does not take wealth with its due is like
the one who eats and does not become full, and it will be a witness against
him on the Day of Rising."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVIII: The excellence of someone who equips a fighter or cares for his
dependents</B>
<P>
2688. It is related from Zayd ibn Khalid that the Messenger of Allah, may

an expedition in the way of Allah has gone on the expedition. Anyone who
looks after someone's family has gone on the expedition."
<P>
2689. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, did not frequent any house in Madina besides those of his wives
except the house of Umm Sulaym. He was asked about it and said, "I feel
compassion for her because her brother was killed with me."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: Using <I>hanut*</I> perfume in fighting</B>
<P>
2690. It is related from Ibn 'Awn that Musa ibn Anas mentioned the Battle
of Yamana and said, "Anas went to Thabit ibn Qays and he had uncovered his
thighs and was applying <I>hanut</I>. He said, 'Uncle, what is keeping you
from coming?' He said, 'I'm coming now, nephew,' and put on the <I>hanut</I>
and then came and sat down." He mentioned in the <I>hadith</I> that the people
were routed. [Thabit] said, 'Get out from in front of us so that we can stike
the people! This is not like what we used to do with the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace! What bad habits you have picked
from your fellows!" Hammad related it from Thabit from Anas.
<P>
[Hanut is a compound scent usually used for the dead.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XL: The excellence of scouts</B>
<P>
2691. It is related that Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and

of the Confederates. Az-Zubayr answered, 'I will!' Then he asked, 'Who will
bring me news of the people*?' Az-Zubayr answered, 'I will!' The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Every Prophet has disciples.
My disciple is az-Zubayr.'"

<B>XLI: Is a scout sent alone?</B>
<P>
2692. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, asked for someone from the people (and Sadaqa
said, "I think that it was the Day of the Ditch.") and az-Zubayr volunteered.

is az-Zubayr.'"

not. They saw a wild ass before he saw. When they saw it, they left it until
Abu Qatada saw it. He mounted a horse of his called al-Jarada and asked them
to hand him his whip but they refused. So he took it and attacked it and
slaughtered it. Then he ate and they ate as well, They went forward and when

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a donkey called 'Ufayr.
He said, 'Mu'adh, do you know what is Allah's right on His slaves and the
right of the slaves on Allah?' I said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.'
He said, 'Allah's right on His slaves is that they should worship Him and
not associate anything with Him. The slaves' right on Allah is that He will
not punish anyone who does not associate anything with Him.' I said, 'Messenger
of Allah, shall I tell the people that so that they can rejoice?' He said,
'Do not give them the good news, for then they will rely on it.'"
<P>
2702. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "There was an alarm in Madina

and for adornment. And He creates other things you do not know."</I> (16:8)
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#3">2705</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Horses are for
three purposes. They are a reward for one man, and a shelter for another
man and a burden for another man. As for the one who has a reward, that is
the man who ties them in the Way of Allah and gives them a long tether in
pasture or meadow. He will have good deeds for whatever it gets from the
pasture or the meadow for the extent of its tether. If it breaks its tether
and crosses a hill or two, then he has good deeds for its tracks and dung.
If it crosses a river and drinks from it, that will be good deeds for him
even if he did not intend to give it water. There is a man who ties them
up out of boasting and showing-off and enmity towards the people of Islam.
It is a burden for that man." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was asked about donkeys and said, "Nothing has been
revealed to me about them except this general single verse, <I>'Whoever has
done an atom's weight of good will see it and whoever has done an atom's
weight of evil will see it.'</I>" (99:7-8)

the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said,
'I travelled with him on one of his journeys. (Abu 'Aqil said, "I do not
know whether it was an expedition or <I>'umra</I>.") When we were coming
back, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever
wants to hurry to his family, should hurry."' Jabir said, 'We advanced and
I was on a dun camel of mine with no blemish. The people were behind me and
while I was like that, it stopped cold with me. The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, "Jabir, stay put." He struck
it a blow with his whip and the camel leapt from its place. He said, "Will
you sell the camel?" I replied, "Yes." When we reached Madina and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered the mosque with the groups
of his Companions, I went to him and hobbled the camel in a corner of the
courtyard. I said to him, "This is your camel." He went out and began to
explain the camel, saying, 'The camel is ours.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, sent some <I>awqiyyas</I> of gold and said, "Give
it to Jabir." Then he said, "Have you received the price in full?" I said,
"Yes." He said, "Both the price and the camel are yours."'"

a people who are archers. When we met them, we attacked them and they were
routed. The Muslims went forward for the booty and they confronted us with
arrows. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
did not flee. I saw him on his while mule and Abu Sufyan had hold of its

between untrained horses, which started at ath-Thaniya and ended at Mosque
of the Banu Zurayq. I asked Musa, "How far was that?" He replied, "About
a mile or so." 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar was one of those who took part in the
race.

that, he said, 'It is a right of Allah that nothing elevates itself in this
world, without Him then bringing it low."

2719. It is related that a man said to al-Bara' ibn 'Azib, "Abu 'Umara! Did
you turn in flight on the Day of Hunayn?" He said, "No, by Allah, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not turn in flight,
but the hasty people turned in flight and Hawazin met them with arrows. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on his while mule and
Abu Sufyan had hold of its rein and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was saying, 'I am the Prophet and it is no lie. I am the
son of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib.'"

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visited the daughter of
Milhan and lay down there and then smiled. She said, 'What made you smile,
Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'Some people from my community who were riding
the green sea in the way of Allah. They are like kings on thrones.' She said,
'Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!' He said, 'O Allah,
put her among them!' 'Then he did it again and smiled. She said the like
to him or part of that and he said the like of that to her. She said, 'Ask
Allah to put me among them.' He said, 'You are among the first and are not
among the last.'" Anas said, "She married 'Ubada ibn as-Samit and embarked
on the sea with the daughter of Qaraza*. When she returned, she mounted her
animal and it threw her and she fell from it and died."

other wives</B>
<P>

Allah bless him and grant him peace, wanted to go out, he would draw lots
between his wives, and the Prophet* would take with him whoever had her lot
come out. He drew lots between us on an expedition pn which he went and my
lot came out and I went out with the Prophet* after the veil had been revealed."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIV: Women going on expeditions and fighting along with the men</B>
<P>
2724. It is related that Anas said, "On the day of Uhud, the people retreated
from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." He said, "I saw
'A'isha bint Abi Bakr and Umm Sulaym with their skirts rolled up so that
I could see their anklets, hurrying with waterskins. (Another said, "Carrying
the waterskins on their backs.") Then they would pour the water in the mouths
of the the people and then go back to fill them up and then come back and
pour it in the mouths of the people."

<P>
2725. It is related from Tha'laba ibn Abi Malik that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
divided up some garments among some of the women of Madina. One excellent
garment remained and one of those with him said, "Amir al-Mu'minin! Give
this to the (grand)daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, to whom you are married (meaning Umm Kultum bint 'Ali)."
'Umar said, "Umm Salit is more entitled." Umm Salit was one of the people
of the Ansar who had given allegiance to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. 'Umar said, "She carried waterskins for us
on the Day of Uhud."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said that <I>tazfiru</I> usually means "to stitch".
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<B>LXVIII: Removing arrows from the body</B>
<P>
2728. It is related that Abu Musa said, "Abu 'Amir was shot in his knee.
I got to him and he said, 'Pull this arrow out.' I pulled it out and water
gushed from it. I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and told him and he said, 'O Allah, forgive 'Ubayd Abu 'Amir."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIX: Guarding in the way of Allah</B>
<P>
2729. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was sleepness. When he reached Madina, he said, 'Would
that a righteous man of my Companions would guard me tonight!' Then we heard
the sound of weapons. He said, 'Who is this?' He said, 'I am Sa'd ibn Abi
Waqqas. I have come to guard you.' So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, slept."
<P>
2730. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "May the slave of the dinar and the dirham, the
<I>qatifa</I> (outer garment) and <I>khamisa</I> (wrap) perish! If he is
given them he is pleased, and if he is not given them he is not pleased."
<P>
Isra'il does not have it <I>marfu' </I>from Abu Husayn.
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "May the slave of the dinar, the slave of the dirham
and the slave of the <I>khamisa</I> perish! If that is given to him, he is
pleased. If that is not given to him, he is displeased. Let him be utterly
ruined and be overturned! If he is pierced by a thorn, let it not be moved!
Blessed is a slave who takes the reins of his horse in the way of Allah,
head dishevelled and feet covered in dust. If he is put in the vanguard,
he is pleased to be in the vanguard. If he is put in the rear, he is pleased
to be in the rear. If he asks for permission, he is not given permission.
If he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted*."
<P>
[* Because of his apparent lack of importance and wealth.]
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said that Isra'il and Muhammad ibn Juhada do not have it<I>
marfu' </I>from Abu Husayn.
<P>
<I>Ta's</I> (47:8) is as if he were saying, "May Allah destroy them."
<I>Tuba</I> (blessed) is the feminine form of everything good
(<I>tayyib</I>). In it th<I>e ya' </I>which is transformed into a <I>waw</I>.
It is that which is good.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXX: The excellence of service in an expedition</B>
<P>
2731. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "I accompanied Jarir ibn 'Abdullah
al-Bajali and he used to serve me," although he was older &nbsp;than Anas.
Jarir said, "I saw the Ansar do something, and I promised myself that whenever
I found any of them I would honour him."
<P>
2732. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "I went out with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to Khaybar to serve him.
When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came back and
Uhud loomed before him, he said, 'This is a mountain that loves us and we
love it.' Then he pointed with his hand towards Madina and said, 'O Allah,
I make inviolable what is between its two lava beds as Ibrahim made Makka
inviolable. O Allah, bless us in our <I>sa' </I>and <I>mudd</I>.'"
<P>
2733. It is related that Anas said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and the only shade we could find was to shade
oneself with his garment. Those who were fasting did not do anything. Those
who were not fasting cared for the camels and served the fasters and treated
them. The Prophet*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Those
who were not fasting have taken the reward today.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXI: The excellence of the one who carries his companion's baggage on
a journey</B>
<P>
2734. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "<I>Sadaqa</I> is owed by every joint every
day. To help a man with his animal and help him onto it is <I>sadaqa</I>.
Or to lift his goods onto it is <I>sadaqa</I>. A good word is <I>sadaqa</I>.
Every step you take to the prayer is <I>sadaqa</I>. Giving directions to
the road is <I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXII: The Excellence of ribat in the way of Allah</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "O you who believe! Be steadfast.; be supreme
in steadfastness; be firm on the battlefield.; and show fear of Allah &#150;
so that perhaps you will be successful." </I>(3:200)
<P>
2735. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "<I>Ribat</I> for one day
in the way of Allah is better than this world and what it contains. The place
of the whip of one of you in the Garden is better than this world and what
it contains. A morning or an evening spent in the way of Allah is better
than this world and everything it contains."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIII: The one who goes on an expedition with a boy to serve him</B>
<P>
2736. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said to Abu Talha, Look out one of your boys to serve
me when I go out to Khaybar.' Abu Talha brought me out riding behind him.
At that time I was a boy who was near puberty. I would serve the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he alighted. I would
often hear him say, 'O Allah, I seek refuge with you from care and sorrow,
incapacity and laziness, miserliness and cowardice, the burden of debt and
being overcome by men.' Then we came to Khaybar and when Allah let him conquer
the fortress, the beauty of Safiyya bint Huyayy ibn Akhtab was mentioned
to him. Her husband had been killed and she was a bride. The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, chose her for himself and
went with her until we reached Sadd ar-Sahba' where she became lawful and
he went to her in marriage. Then some <I>hays</I> was put on a small leather
mat. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Announce it to those around you.' That was the marriage-feast of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with Safiyya.
Then we left for Madina." He said, "I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, enfolding her behind him in his cloak. Then
he sat beside his camel and put his knee up and Safiyya put her foot on his
knee to mount. We travelled until when we were looking over Madina, he looked
at Uhud and said, 'This is a mopuntain which loves us and we love it.' Then
he looked at Madina and said, O Allah, I make inviolable what is between
its two lava beds as Ibrahim made Makka inviolable. O Allah, bless them in
their <I>sa'</I> and <I>mudd</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIV: Embarking on the sea</B>
<P>
2737. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that Umm Haram related to him that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was having a midday
nap one day in her house and woke up, smiling. She said, "Messenger of Allah,
what made you smile?" He said, "I marvelled at some people of my community
riding the sea like kings on thrones." [She said, "I said, 'Messenger of
Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!' He said, 'You are among them.' Then
he went to sleep and woke up, smiling and said the like of that twice or
three times. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to put me among them!'
He said, 'You are among the first.'" 'Ubada ibn as-Samit married her and
took her on the expedition. When she returned, an animal was brought near
for her to mount and she fell and broke her neck."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXV: The one who asks for the help of the weak and the righteous in war</B>
<P>
2738. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "Abu Sufyan reported to me, 'Caesar
said to me, "I asked you whether the nobles or humble people followed him
and you said that the humble people followed him. They are always the ones
who follow the Messengers."'"
<P>
2739. It is related that Mus'ab ibn Sa'd said, "Sa'd thought that he had
preference over those below him and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'Are you given victory and provision except on account
of the weak among you?'"
<P>
2740. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "A time will come when groups of people
will go on expedition. It will be said, 'Is there any among you who kept
the company of the Prophet?' It will be said, 'Yes,' and victory will be
given because of him. Then a time will come when it will be said, 'Is there
any among you who kept the company of the Companions of the Prophet?' It
will be said, 'Yes.' And victory will be given. Then a time will come when
it will be said, 'Is there any among you who kept the company of the companions
of the Companions of the Prophet?' It will be said, 'Yes.' And victory will
be given."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVI: Do not say, "So-and-so is a martyr."</B>
<P>
2741. It is related that Abu Hurayra said from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, "Allah knows best the one who does jihad in His
way and Allah knows best the one who is wounded in His way."
<P>
2742. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the idolaters met and fought.
When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, returned
to his camp, the others returned to their camp. A man among the Companions
of the Messenger of Allah said that he would follow any of them who was separate
or alone and strike him down with his sword. They said, "Today none of us
has given satisfaction as so-and-so has!" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "He is one of the people of the Fire."
A man of the people said, "I will accompany him." (He said,) He went out
with him and stopped with him. He hurried when he hurried. The man received
a severe wound and hastened his death by placing the hilt of his sword in
the earth and its point at his breast and then fell on his sword and killed
himself. The man went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and said, "I testify that you are the Messenger of Allah."
He said, "What is it?" He said, "Regarding the man you mentioned before as
being one of the people of the Fire, which people thought terrible, I said,
'I will go out to follow him.' Then he received a severe wound and he hastened
his death by placing the hilt on his sword in the earth and point at his
breast and then he fell on it and killed himself." At that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A man can do the
actions of the people of the Garden in what he shows to people, while he
is one of the people of the Fire, and a man can do the actions of the people
of the Fire in what he shows to people, while he is one of the people of
the Garden."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXVII: Encouragement of shooting</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Arm yourselves against them with all the
firepower and cavalry you can muster, to terrify the enemies of Allah and
your enemies."</I> (8:60)
<P>
2743. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, passed by a group of Aslam who were shooting
against one another and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Shoot, Banu Isma'il! Your ancestor was an archer. Shoot, and I am
with the the Banu so-and-so.' So one of the two parties stopped shooting,
and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked,
'Why are you not shooting?' They said, 'How can we shoot when you are with
them?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Shoot,
and I am with all of you.'"
<P>
2744. It is related that Abu Usayd said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said on the Day of Badr when we were lined up against
Quraysh and they were lined up against us, 'When they draw near you, then
you must shoot.'"
<P>
<P>

<P>
2745. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "'Umar entered while the Abyssinians
were playing with their spears in the presence of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. He picked up some pebbles and threw them at
them, He said, ''Umar, leave them be!'" It is added from Ma'mar that they
were in the mosque.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXIX: Shields and the one who is shielded with his companion's shield</B>
<P>
2746. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "Abu Talha was shielding himself
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with the same shield,
Abu Talha was a good archer. When he shot, the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, would look over to see where his arrow landed."
<P>
2747. It is related that Sahl said, "When the helmet of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was broken on his head and his face
was bloodied and his front-tooth was broken, 'Ali brought water in his shield
and Fatima washed him. When she saw that the water increased the bleeding,
she got a mat and burned it and then applied it to his wound and the bleeding
subsided."
<P>
2748. It is related that 'Umar said, "The property of the Banu'n-Nadir was
part of the booty which Allah gave His Messenger for which the Muslims did
not stir horses or camels. It was for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, in particular and he would spend the yearly maintenance
of his family from it and then put what remained into arms and horses as
preparation for the way of Allah."
<P>
2749. It is related from 'Ali. [see below]
<P>
It is related that 'Ali said, "I did not see the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, saying, 'May my father and mother be your ransom'
to any man after Sa'd. I heard him say, 'Shoot, may my father and mother
be your ransom!'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXX: Leather shields</B>
<P>
2750. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came to visit me when there were two slavegirls
with me singing about Bu'ath. He lay down on the bed and turned his face
away. Abu Bakr came and scolded me, saying, 'Musical instruments from Shaytan
in the presence of the Messenger of Allah!' The Messenger of Allah, peace
be upon him, turned to him and said, 'Leave them be.' When (Abu Bakr) was
not paying any attention, I signalled to them and they went out." She said,
"This was the day of th<I>e 'Id </I>and the black people were playing a game
with their spears and shields. Either I asked the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, or he himself said, 'Do you want to have a look?'
I said, 'Yes,' so he stood me behind him with my cheek against his and said,
'Go on, Banu Arfida!' until I became bored. He said, 'Is that enough for
you?' I said, 'Yes' and he said, 'Go on then.'"
<P>
Ahmad said from Ibn Wahb, "When he was not paying any attention."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXI: Sword-straps and hanging the sword on the shoulder</B>
<P>
2751. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was the best of people and the bravest of people. One night
the people of Madina were alarmed and went out towards the sound. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, met them and he had already verified
the business. He was on a horse belonging to Abu Talha without a saddle,
with a sword on his shoulder. He said, 'Do not be alarmed. Do not be alarmed.'
Then he said [about the horse], 'We found it like the sea,' or 'It is a sea.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXII: Embellishing swords</B>
<P>
2752. It is related that Abu Umama said, "People made the conquests without
gold or silver embellishments on their swords. Their embellishment was tanned
leather, lead and iron."

<P>
2753. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah reported that he went on an
expedition with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, in the direction of Najd. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, returned, he returned with him. Midday overtook
them in a valley with a lot of large thorn-trees in it. The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, alighted and the people split
up to seek the shade of the trees. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, alighted under a tree and hung his sword on it.
He said, "We went to sleep and then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, called out to us. There was a bedouin with him and
he said, 'This one unsheathed my sword against me while I was asleep. I woke
up and he had it unsheathed in his hand and he demanded, "Who will protect
you from me?" I replied, "Allah" three times.' He did not punish him, and
he sat down."

<P>
<B>LXXXIV: Wearing helmets</B>
<P>

Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of Uhud. He said, "The face
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was wounded,
his front-tooth broken and his helmet was smashed on his head. Fatima, peace
be upon her, washed the blood away while 'Ali held the water. When she saw
that it increased the bleeding, she took a mat and burned it until it was
ash and then applied it and the bleeding stopped."

<P>
It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah reported that he went on an expedition
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Midday overtook
them in a valley with a lot of large thorn-trees in it. The people split
up to seek the shade of the thorn-trees. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, satunder a tree, hung his sword on it and
then went to sleep. He woke up and a man was with him whom he had not noticed.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "This man unsheathed
my sword and demanded, 'Who will protect you from me?' I replied, 'Allah.'
He sheathed the sword, and here he is sitting here." Then he did not punish
him.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXVII: What is said about spears</B>
<P>
It is mentioned from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, "My provision has been placed under the shadow of my spear,
and abasement and humility have been placed on the one who disobeys my command."
<P>
<A HREF="muw7.html#77">2757</A>. It is related from Abu Qatada that he was
with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
when they had gone part of the way on the road to Makka, he fell behind with
some of his companions who were in <I>ihram</I>. He himself was not in
<I>ihram</I>. He spotted a wild ass and mounted his horse and asked his
companions to hand him his whip but they refused. He asked them to hand him
his spear and they refused. So he took it, attacked the ass and killed it.
Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, ate from it and some refused. When they caught up to the
Messenger of Allah, &nbsp;may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they asked
him about that. He said, "It is food which Allah has fed you."
<P>
The like of the <I>hadith</I> of Abu'n-Nadr about the wild ass is related
from Abu Qatada in which he said, "Do you have any of its meat with you?"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXVIII: What is said about the armour of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and his shirt in war</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &nbsp;said, "Khalid
has kept his armour in the way of Allah."
<P>
2758. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said while he was in a tent, 'O Allah, I ask you by
Your pledge and Your promise! O Allah, if You wish, you will not be worshipped
after this day!' Abu Bakr took his hand and said, 'Enough, Messenger of Allah.
You have implored your Lord.' He was in armour and he went out, saying, <I>"The
assembly will be routed and turn their backs in flight. In fact the Hour
is their promised appointment and the Hour is more disastrous and bitter!'
</I>(54:45-36)"
<P>
Wuhayb said that Khalid related that it was the Day of Badr.
<P>
2759. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah

<P>
It is related that al-A'mash said, "He had pledged his iron armour."
<P>
2760. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The likeness of the miser and the one
who gives is like two men wearing shirts of chain-mail from their breasts
to their collar bones. When the giver of <I>sadaqa</I> spends, his shirt
expands over his body until it covers his fingertips and obliterates his
footsteps. When the miser wants to spend anything, every link remains in
its place and constricts him, and his hands are pressed to his collar bones."
He heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "He tries
to make it looser but it will not get looser."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXXXIX: The cloak on journeys and in war</B>
<P>
2761. It is related that al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to relieve himself. Then
he faced <I>qibla</I> and I brought the water. He was wearing a Syrian cloak.
He washed his mouth and snuffed water up his nose and washed his face. He
tried to put his hand through his sleeves, but they were too tight and so
he brought them out from underneath and washed them and wiped his head and
over his leather socks."
<P>
<P>

of Allah?" He replied, "No."'"

It is as if their faces were shields covered with skin."
<P>

did you flee on the Day of Hunayn?' He said, 'No, by Allah. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not turn his back,
but some of the young men and light-armed of his Companions went out in an
unarmed group. They came to some people who were archers of Hawazin and the
Banu Nasr whose arrows rarely missed the target, and they shot their arrows
at them which hardly missed. They then made for the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, who was on his white mule which was being led by
his cousin, Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib. He dismounted
and asked for victory and then said, 'I am the Prophet and it is no lie.
I am the son of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib.' Then he formed his Companions into ranks."

<P>
2774. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless

pray, 'O Allah, deliver Salama ibn Hisham! O Allah, deliver al-Walid ibn
al-Walid! O Allah, deliver 'Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'a! O Allah, deliver all oppressed
believers! O Allah, be hard on Mudar! O Allah, give them years of drought
like the drought years of Yusuf!'"
<P>
[cf. Qur'an 12:48]
<P>
2775. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa was heard to say, "On the
Day of the Confederates, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and

down the Book, who is swift in the Reckoning! O Allah, defeat the Confederates!
O Allah, defeat them and shake them!'"
<P>
2776. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "Once the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was praying in the shadow of the Ka'ba when Abu
Jahl and some people of Quraysh said, 'A camel has been sacrificed in part
of Makka.' So they sent someone for its placenta which they threw on him.
Fatima came and threw it off of him. He said, 'O Allah! Deal with the Quraysh!
O Allah! Deal with the Quraysh! O Allah! Deal with the Quraysh!' and he named
Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, 'Utba ibn Rabi'a, Shayba ibn Rabi'a, al-Walid ibn 'Utba,
Umayya ibn Khalaf and 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt." 'Abdullah said, "I saw them
dead in the well of Badr."
<P>
Abu Ishaq said, "I forgot the seventh." Abu Ishaq said, "Umayya ibn Khalaf,"
and Shu'ba said, "Umayya or Ubayy." The sound version is Umayya.
<P>
2777. It is related from 'A'isha, "The Jews visited the Prophet*, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Poison upon you, (<I>as-samu
'alayk</I>)' and I cursed them. He said, 'What is wrong with you?' I said,

Daws and bring them!'"
<P>
<P>
<B>C: Inviting the Jews and Christians and for what reason they are fought.
What the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wrote to Chosroes
and Caesar. Inviting (to Islam) before fighting</B>
<P>
2780. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "When Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wanted to write to the Greeks, he
was told that they would not read letters unless they were sealed. So he
took a signet-ring of silver. It is as if I were looking at its whiteness
on his hand. It was engraved with, 'Muhammad, Messenger of Allah'."
<P>
2781. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sent his letter to Chosroes. He commanded
that it be given to the governor of Bahrayn and the governor of Bahrayn should
give it to Chosroes. When Chosroes read the letter, he tore it up. Ibn Shihab
reckoned that Ibn al-Musayyab said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, put a curse on them that they would be torn to pieces.
<P>
<P>
<B>CI: The Prophet calling to Islam and prophethood, and that they should
not take one another as lords apart from Allah</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "It is not right for any human being that
Allah should give him the Book and Judgement and Prophethood, and then that
he should say to people, 'Be worshippers of me rather than Allah. Rather
he will say, 'Be people of the Lord because of your knowledge of the Book
and because you study.'"</I> (3:79)
<P>
2782. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas reported, "The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wrote to Caesar to invite
him to Islam. He sent his letter to him with Dihya al-Kalbi. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded him to give
it to the governor of Bosra for him to give to Caesar. When Allah had defeated
the armies of Persia for Caesar, he had walked from Homs to Jerusalem out
of gratitude for the blessing Allah had given him. When the letter of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reached Caesar,
after reading it, he said, 'Seek out for me any of his people here so that
I can question him about the Messenger of Allah.'"
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "Abu Sufyan informed me that he had been in Syria with some
men of Quraysh who had come to trade in the period of the truce between the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the unbelievers
of Quraysh. Abu Sufyan said, 'Caesar's messenger found us in part of Syria
and brought me and my companions to Jerusalem and we entered where he was.
He was sitting in his royal assembly wearing the crown and the great men
of Byzantium were around him. He said to his translator, "Ask them which
among you is closest in lineage to this man who claims that he is a Prophet?"
Abu Sufyan said, "I am the nearest to him in lineage." He asked, "What is
the kinship between you and him?" I said, "He is my nephew, and there is
no one in the caravan today from the Banu 'Abdu'l-Manaf but me." Caesar said,
"Bring him near," and he commanded that my companions be put directly behind
me by my shoulder. Then he said to his translator, "Tell his companions and
I am asking this man about the one who claims that he is a Prophet. If he
tells me a lie, then they should call him a liar."'
<P>
"Abu Sufyan said, 'By Allah, if it had not been for the shame that my companions
would say that I was lying, I would have lied to him that day when he asked
me about him. But I was embarrassed that they would say that I lied, so I
told him the truth. Then he said to his translator, "Ask him what is the
lineage of this man among you?" I replied, "He has noble lineage among us."
He asked, "Has any of you made this statement before him?" I said, "No."
He said, "Did you used to suspect him of lying before he said what he said?"
I said, "No." He asked, "Was any of his ancestors a king?" I answered, "No."
He said, "Do the nobles of the people follow him or their humble ones?" I
replied, "Their humble ones." He asked, "Are they on the increase or decrease?"
I said, "They are on the increase." He asked, "Does any of them become displeased
with his <I>deen</I> and apostatise after entering it?" I answered, "No."
He said, "Does he act treacherously?" I replied, "No, but at the moment we
have a truce with him that we fear he may betray."
<P>
"Abu Sufyan said, 'I could not get a word in at all in which I deprecated
him without fearing that they would call me a liar. He asked, " Have you
fought him or has he fought you?" I said, "Yes." He said, "How was the war
behind you and him?" I said, "Success in the war alternated between us -
sometimes he would get the better of us and sometimes we of him." He said,
"What does he order you to do?"' He said, 'He commands us to worship Allah
alone and not associate anything with Him and forbids us what our ancestors
worshipped. He commands us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to
fulfil contracts and to hand over trusts.'
<P>
"When I said that to him, he said to his translator, 'Tell him: "I asked
you about his lineage among you and you mentioned that he has noble lineage;
in the same way all the Messengers who were sent came from noble lineage
among their peoples. I asked you whether anyone else among you had said such
a thing before him and you asserted they had not. If any of you had said
this before him, I would have said that he was a man following the precedent
of something said before. I asked you whether you accused him of being a
liar before he said what he said and you said no. I knew that he not would
refuse to lie about people and then tell lies against Allah. I asked you
whether any of his ancestors was a king and you said no. I said that if one
of his ancestors had been a king, I would have said that he was a man seeking
the kingdom of his ancestors. I asked you whether the nobles or humble people
followed him and you said that their humble people followed him. They are
the ones who follow the Messengers. I asked you whether they were on the
increase or decrease and you said that they were on the increase. That is
what happens with belief until it is complete. I asked you whether anyone
had apostatized out of dislike for his <I>deen</I> after he had entered and
you stated that they had not. That is how it is with belief when its joy
mixes with the hearts - no one dislikes it. I asked you whether he had been
treacherous and you said no. That is how it is with the Messengers. They
are not treacherous. I asked you whether you had fought him and he had fought
you, and you said that it had happened and that success in the war alternated
between you - sometimes he would get the better of you and sometimes you
of him. Messengers are tested like that and they have the final outcome.
I asked you what he commanded you and you stated that he commanded you to
worship Allah and not associate anything with him and forbade you what your
fathers were worshipping, and he commanded you to pray, speak truthfully,
be chaste, fulfill contracts and return trusts.' He said, 'This is the
description of the Prophet. I knew that he was going to appear, but I did
not think that it would be from you. If what you said is true, then he will
soon control this place where these two feet of mine are now standing. If
I knew that I could reach him, I would set out to meet him. If I were with
him, I would wash his feet.'
<P>
"Abu Sufyan said, 'Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it was read out. It said: "In
the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful, from Muhammad, the
slave of Allah and His Messenger, to Heraclius, ruler of the Byzantines.
Peace be upon the one who follows guidance. Following on from that: I call
you to Islam. If you become Muslim, you will be safe and Allah will double
your reward. If you turn away, then you incur the wrong actions of your subjects.
And, <I>'O People of the Book! Come to a proposition which is the same for
us and you &#150; that we should worship none but Allah and not attribute
any partners to Him and not take one another as lords besides Allah. If they
turn away, say, "Bear witness that we are Muslims."' </I>(3:64)"'
<P>
"Abu Sufyan said, 'When he finished what he said, the voices of the great
men of Byzantium around him were raised and there was a great uproar. I do
not know what they said. We were turned out. When I went out with my companions
and was alone with them, I said to them, "This business of Ibn Abi Kabsha
has become so prominent that he alarms even the King of the Greeks."'
<P>
"Abu Sufyan said, "By Allah, I remained humble and was certain that he would
be victorious until Allah brought my heart to Islam while I disliked it.'"
<P>
2783. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd heard the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say on the Day of Khaybar, "Tomorrow
I will give the banner to a man at whose hands Allah will conquer. He loves
Allah and His Messenger and Allah and his Messenger love him." They spent
the night wondering who it would be given to, and in the morning all of them
were hoping to get it. He said, "Where is 'Ali?" He was told, "He has something
wrong with his eyes." He commanded that he be summoned and he spat in his
eyes and the place was healed as if there had not been anything wrong with
it. He said, "Shall we fight them until they become the same as us?" He said,
"Take it easy until you alight in their quarter and then invite them to Islam
and tell them what is incumbent on them regarding the rights of Allah Almighty.
By Allah, for one man to be guided by you is better for you than having red
camels."
<P>
[Red camels were the most precious form of wealth among the Arabs.]
<P>
2784. It is related that Anas said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, attacked a people, he did not attack until
morning. If he heard the <I>adhan</I>, he would hold back. If he did not
hear the <I>adhan</I>, he would attack after it was morning. We alighted
at Khaybar in the night."
<P>
It is related from Anas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, raided with us."
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#48">2785</A>. It is related from Anas, "The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to Khaybar and reached it at
night. When he came to a people at night, he would not attack them until
morning. When it was morning, the Jews came out carrying their spades and
buckets. When they saw him, they said, 'Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad and
the army!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Allah is greater! Khaybar is destroyed. When we alight in the yard
of a people, it is a bad morning indeed for those who have been warned.'"
<P>
2786. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I have been commanded to fight
people until they say that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is
the Messenger of Allah. Then their lives and property are protected from
me except for the right [of Islam], and their reckoning is up to Allah."
<P>
'Umar and Ibn 'Umar related it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>CII: The one who intends to go on an expedition and gives the impression
he is going elsewhere. The one who wanted to set out on Thursday.</B>
<P>
2787. It is related that Ka'b ibn Malik was heard to say when he stayed behind
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Whenever
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, intended
to go on an expedition, he would give the impression that he was going
elsewhere."
<P>
2788. It is related that Ka'b ibn Malik was heard to say, "When the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, intended to make an
expedition, it was rare that he did not give the impression that he was going
elsewhere, until the expedition of Tabuk. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, set out against&nbsp;it in severe heat and
he faced a long journey though the desert and was embarking on an expedition
against a numerous foe. He made the business clear to the Muslims so that
they could make necessary preparation against the enemy. He told them the
direction he was taking."
<P>
2789. It is related that Ka'b ibn Malik said, "Rarely did the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set out on a journey when
he set out on other than on a Thursday."
<P>
2790. It is related that Ka'b ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, set out on a Thursday on the expedition of Tabuk.
He preferred to set out on a Thursday."
<P>
<P>
<B>CIII: Setting out after <I>Dhuhr</I></B>
<P>
2791. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> in Madina, doing four <I>rak'ats</I>, and
and<I> 'Asr </I>with two <I>rak'ats</I> at Dhu'l-Hulayfa. "I heard them shouting
[the <I>talbiyya</I>] for both [<I>hajj</I> and <I>'umra</I>] together."
<P>
<P>
<B>CIV: Setting out at the end of the month</B>
<P>
2792. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, set out from Madina when five days were left of Dhu'l-Qa'da
and arrived in Makka on the fourth night of Dhu'l-Hijja."
<P>
2793. It is related that 'A'isha was heard to say, "We set out with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when five days were left
of Dhu'l-Qa'da with no other intention than to perform hajj. When we drew
near Makka, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
commanded the one who did not have any sacrificial animal with him, to come
out of <I>ihram</I> when he had done <I>tawaf</I> of the House and run between
Safa and Marwa." 'A'isha said, "On the Day of Sacrifice, some beef was brought
into us and I asked, 'What is this?' The reply was, 'The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has sacrificed a cow on behalf of
his wives.'"
<P>
Yahya said, "I mentioned this <I>hadith</I> to al-Qasim ibn Muhammad and
he said, 'By Allah, she [referring to 'Amra bint 'Abdu'r-Rahman in the
<I>isnad</I>] has brought you this <I>hadith</I> in its proper form.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CV: Setting out in Ramadan</B>
<P>
2794. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, set out in Ramadan and fasted until he reached
al-Kadid where he broke his fast."
<P>
Another <I>isnad</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>CVI: Bidding farewell</B>
<P>
2795. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sent us out on an expedition and said, 'If
you meet so-and-so and so-and-so - two men of Quraysh whom he named - then
burn them with fire.' We came to him to say goodbye and when we wanted to
leave, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'I ordered you to burn so-and-so and so-and-so with fire. Only Allah punishes
by fire. If you come across them, then kill them.'"
<P>
[The two men referred to were Habbar ibn al-Aswad and another man who had
accousted &nbsp;the camel of Zaynab, his daughter, so that it threw her off.]
<P>
<P>
<B>CVII: Hearing and obeying the ruler</B>
<P>
2796. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Hearing and obeying is a duty as long one is
not commanded to rebellion (against Allah). When one is commanded to rebellion,
then there is no hearing and obeying."
<P>
<P>
<B>CVIII: Fighting in front of the ruler and seeking his protection</B>
<P>
2797. It is related that Abu Hurayra heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, "We are the last, but the outstrippers."
And in this <I>isnad</I>, "Whoever obeys me, has obeyed Allah. Whoever disobeys
me, has disobyed Allah. Whoever obeys the amir, has obeyed me, and whoever
disobeys the amir, has obeyed me. The ruler is a protection. One fights before
him and is protected by him. If he commands fear of Allah and justice, then
he has a reward for that. If he says something else, then he will bear the
consequences of that."
<P>
<P>
<B>CIX: Allegiance in battle not to flee. One of them said: "to the death"
by the words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Allah was pleased with the believers
when they pledged allegiance to you under the Tree." </I>(48:18)</B>
<P>
2798. It is related from Ibn 'Umar , "We returned the following year, and
not even two of us could agree about which was the tree under which we had
given allegiance. That was a mercy from Allah." [Juwayriyya said,] "I asked
Nafi', 'On what basis did he take allegiance from them? Until death?' He
said, 'No, he took allegiance from them on the basis of them remaining
steadfast.'"
<P>
2799. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Zayd said that at the time of the
Battle of al-Harra, someone came to him and said to him, "The son of Hanzala
is taking allegiance to death." He said, "I will not give allegiance to anyone
for that after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace."
<P>
2800. It is related that Salama said, "I gave allegiance to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then turned away to the shade
of the tree. When the crowd lessened, he said, 'O Ibn al-Akwa'! Will you
not give allegiance?' I said, 'I have already given allegiance, Messenger
of Allah!' He said, 'Again.' So I gave him allegiance a second time." [Yazid
ibn Abi 'Ubayd said,] 'I said to him, 'Abu Muslim, on what basis did you
give allegiance on that day?' He replied, 'To death.'"
<P>
2801. It is related that Anas was heard to say, "On the Day of the Ditch,
the Ansar were saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'We are those who have given allegiance to Muhammad
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; to fight jihad forever as long as we live.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, replied to them and
said, 'O Allah, there is no life but the life of the Next World. Honour the
Ansar and the Muhajirun!'"
<P>
2802. It is related that Mujashi' said, "I and my brother came to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I said, 'Take our allegiance
based on emigration.' He said, 'Emigration has passed with its people.' I
asked, 'On what basis will you take our allegiance?' He replied, "On Islam
and jihad.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CX: The ruler ordering the people to do what they are capable of</B>
<P>
2803. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "Today a man came to me and asked
me about about something to which I did not know how to respond. He said,
'What if a well-armed and energetic man goes out with our commanders on
expeditions and orders us to do things we are incapable of?' I said to him,
'By Allah, I do not know what to tell you. We were with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and would only command us
to do something but once and we would do it. Each of you will remain in good
as long as he fears Allah. When he has doubts about something in himself,
he should ask a man who can remove his doubt. But a time will soon come when
you will not find (such a man). By Him, and there is no god but Him, I only
think that what remains of this world is like a pond whose pure water has
been drunk and only its muddy water remains."

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, participated, he waited until the
sun declined and then stood up to address the people and said, "O people!
Do not be too eager to meet the enemy and ask Allah for well-being. When
you do meet them, be steadfast. Know that the Garden lies under the shadow
of the swords." Then he said, "O Allah, Sender-down of the Book and Mover
of the clouds and Vanquisher of the companies, defeat them and help us against
them!"'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CXII: A man asking permission from the ruler</B>
<P>
By His words, <I>"The believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger
and who, when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not leave
until they have asked him for permission. Those people who do ask you for
permission are the ones who truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. If
they ask your permission to attend to their own affairs, give permission
to any of them you please; and ask Allah's forgiveness for them. Allah is
Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </I>(24:62)
<P>
2805. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I went on an expedition
with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, caught up to me while I
was on an irrigation camel of ours that had become tired so that it could
hardly walk. He asked me, 'What is wrong with your camel?' I answered, 'It
is tired.'" He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, went behind and chided it and prayed for it and it went between
the camels until it was going in front of them. He said, 'How do you find
your camel?' I said, 'Well. It has your blessing.' He asked, 'Will you sell
it to me?' I was shy although we did not have any other camel besides it.
I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Sell it to me then,' so I sold it to him provided
that I could ride on its back until I reached Madina."
<P>
He said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I am a bridegroom,' and I asked his
permission [to go ahead] and he gave me permission. I preceded the people
to Madina and my uncle meet me. He asked me about the camel and I told him
what I had done about it. He criticised me. When I had asked the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for permission, he asked
me, 'Have you married a virgin or a woman who was married prviously?' I said,
'I have married a woman who was married previously.' He asked, 'Why not a
virgin whom you could play with and who could play with you?' I said, 'O
Messenger of Allah, my father died - or was martyred - and I have young sisters.
I did not want to marry someone like them who could not discipline them or
and take care of them. Therefore I married a woman who had been previously
married to care for them and discipline them.'"
<P>
He said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, reached Madina, I took the camel to him and he gave me its price and
then returned it to me."

funds.' He said, 'Your wealth is yours, but I want that part of my money
be used in this way.'"
<P>
'Umar said, "Some people took some of this money for doing <I>jihad</I> and
then they do not do <I>jihad</I>. If someone does that, we are more entitled
to that money so that we can reclaim from him what he took."
<P>
Tawus and Mujahid said, "When you are paid something to spend in the way
of Allah, then do what you like and place it with your family."
<P>

it was conquered, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'I will give the banner - or it will be taken - tomorrow to
a man whom Allah and his Messenger love or who loves Allah and His Messenger,

victory."

he pulled his hand from his mouth and his tooth fell out. He went to the

Abu Bakr, 'By Allah, I do not find anything with which to tie it except my

without your camels?' He went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, how will they survive without their
camels?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Summon the people to bring what remains of their provision.' He made
supplication and asked for blessing for it. Then he called on them to bring

say the <I>takbir</I> three times whenever he went up a mountain path or

and found was the woman. We said, "Produce the letter." She answered, "I

of the people of Makka, informing them about some of the business of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "O Hatib, what is
this?" He replied, "O Messenger of Allah, do not be hasty with me. I am a
man with close connections to the Quraysh, but I was not one of them while
those of the Muhajirun with you have relatives in Makka who will protect
their family and property. Since I lacked that lineage among them, I wanted
to have some favour with them with which to protect my relatives. I did not
do it out of disbelief or apostasy, nor out of being pleased with disbelief
after Islam." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "He has told you the truth." 'Umar said, "O Messenger of Allah, let
me strike off the head of this hypocrite!" He answered, "He was present at
Badr and what will inform you? Perhaps Allah looked down on the people of
Badr and said, 'Do what you like. I have forgiven you.'"'"

night wondering to whom it would be given, and in the morning all of them
were hoping for it. He asked, "Where is 'Ali?" He was told, "He has something
wrong with his eyes." He spat in his eyes and made supplication for him,
and it was healed as if there had not been anything wrong with it. He gave
it to him and he said, "Shall I will fight them until they are like us?"
He said, "Go easy until you arrive in their quarter and then invite them

be guided by you is better for you than having than red camels."

went and drink their urine and milk until they were cured and fat, and then
they killed the herdsman and drove away the camels and rejected after their
Islam. The cry for help reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and he sent people to pursue them. The sun was not yet high when
they were brought. He ordered that their hands and feet cut off and nails
were driven in their eyes and they were cast out into al-Harra'. They asked

and he (the Prophet) struck me in my chest so that I saw the marks of his
fingers on my chest. He said, "O Allah, make him firm and make him a guided
guide."' He went to it and broke it up and burnt it. Then he sent the news
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Jarir's
messenger said, 'By the One who sent you with the truth, I did not come to
you until I left it as if it was an emaciated - or scabby - camel.' He said,
'May Allah bless the horses and riders of Ahmas' five times."

Rafi'", and I altered my voice. He said, "What do you want, woe to your mother?"
I said, "What has happened to you?" He said, "I do not know who came to me
and struck me."' He said, 'I placed my sword on his belly and then pushed
on it until it hit the bone. Then I went out in confusion and came to a ladder
of theirs so that I could use it to get down, but I fell and sprained my
foot. I went out to my companions and said, 'I will not leave until I hear
his death announced.' I did not leave until I heard them announcing the death

position of yours until I sent to you. Even if you see that we have defeated
the people and made them retreat, do not leave this position of yours until
I sent to you.' They defeated them and, by Allah, I saw the women running
with their anklets and their legs showing, garments raised. The companions
of 'Abdullah ibn Jubayr said, 'Booty, o people! Booty! Your companions are
victorious! Why are you waiting?' 'Abdullah ibn Jubayr said, 'Have you forgotten
what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told
you?' They said, 'By Allah, we will go to the people and get our share of
the booty.' When they went to them, things were reversed and they turned
in defeat. At that time the Messenger was calling them from the rear. Only
twelve men remained with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and seventy of us were struck down. On the day of Badr, the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his Companions had struck down one
hundred and forty of the idolaters - seventy were captured and seventy were
killed. Abu Sufyan demanded, 'Is Muhammad among the people?' three times.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade them to answer
him. Then he said, 'Is the son of Abu Quhafa among the people?' three times.
Then he said, 'Is the son of al-Khattab among the people?' Then he returned
to his companions and said, 'Those have been killed.' 'Umar could not restrain
himself and said, 'By Allah, you have lied, enemy of Allah! All of those
you numbered are among the living! That which will vex you remains!' He said,
'A day which is in return for the day of Badr. Victory in war goes in turns.
You will find some of the people mutilated. I did not order it, but it does
not vex me.' Then he began to recite, 'Hubal be high! Hubal be high!' The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Why do you not answer
him?' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, what shall we say?' He said, 'Say:
"Allah is Higher and More Majestic."' Abu Sufyan said, 'We have al-'Uzza
and you have no 'Uzza!' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

He said, 'The milk camels of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him

fields heard me, 'O companions! O companions!' Then I rushed on until I caught

mule's rein and when the idolaters encircled him, he dismounted and began

and put 'Asim ibn Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of 'Asim ibn 'Umar ibn
al-Khattab, in command of them. They proceeded until they reached Had'a,
which is located between 'Usfan and Makka. Their presence was reported to
a branch of Hudhayl called the Banu Lihyan. About a hundred men, who were
all archers, set out after them. They followed their tracks until they found
where they had eaten dates which they had taken as provision from Madina.
They said, 'These are the dates of Yathrib,' and they followed their tracks.
<P>
"When 'Asim and his companions perceived them, they took cover in a high
place. The people surrounded them and said, 'Come down and give yourselves
up! You have protection and assurance that we will not kill any of you!'
'Asim ibn Thabit, the commander of the expedition, said, 'O people! As for
me, I will not come down into the protection of an unbeliever! O Allah, inform
Your Prophet about us!' They shot at them with arrows and killed seven of
them, including 'Asim. A group of three came down, accepting the offer of
protection and security. They included Khubayb al-Ansari, Zayd ibn Dathina,
and another man. When they had them in their power, they undid their bow-strings
and tied them up. Then the third man said, 'This is the beginning of treachery!
By Allah, I will not accompany you! There is a good example in these!' i.e.
those who had been killed. They dragged him and tried to persuade him to
accompany them. He refused, so they killed him. They took Khubayb and Zayd
ibn Dathina and sold them in Makka after the Battle of Badr.
<P>
"The sons of al-Harith ibn 'Amir ibn Nawfal ibn 'Abdu Manaf purchased Khubayb.
Khubayb was the man who had killed al-Harith in the Battle of Badr. So Khubayb
remained a prisoner with them ."
<P>
'Ubaydullah ibn 'Iyad reported that the daughter of al-Harith reported that
when they gathered, he asked to borrow a razor from her with which to shave
his private parts and she lent it to him. "He took a son of mine who had
gone to him when I was inattentive." She said, "I found him sitting on his
thigh and the razor was in his hand. I was so alarmed that Khubayb noticed
it in my face and he asked, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? I would
never do that.' By Allah, I never saw a better prisoner than Khubayb. By
Allah, one day I found him eating from a bunch of grapes he had in his hand,
when he was shackled in irons and there was no fruit in Makka.' She used
to say, 'It was provision from Allah which He gave to Khubayb.' When they
brought him out of the Haram to kill him in profane land, Khubayb said to
them, 'Let me pray two <I>rak'ats</I>.' They let him pray two <I>rak'ats</I>.
Then he said, 'By Allah, were it not that you might think that I was afraid,
I would have made them longer. O Allah, reckon them one by one, every one
of them!' He then said:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'I do not care what manner death I die

  &nbsp; &nbsp; He can bless the joints of a torn limb!'"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
"Then the son of al-Harith killed him. So it was Khubayb who set the
<I>sunna</I> for every Muslim man who is killed in detention to pray two
<I>rak'ats</I>. Allah answered the supplication of 'Asim ibn Thabit on the
day he was struck down and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, informed his Companions about them on the day they fell. When they
were informed that 'Asim ibn Thabit had been killed, some of the unbelievers
of Quraysh were sent to bring part of him that could be recognised. He had
killed one of their great men on the Day of Badr. Allah sent over 'Asim a
swarm of bees like a cloud and it protected him from their messenger and
they could not cut off any part of his flesh."

bless him and grant him peace, said, "Free the captives, i.e. prisoner, feed
the hungry, and visit the sick."
<P>
2882. It is related that Abu Juhayfa said, "I asked 'Ali, 'Do you have any
of the revelation other than what is in the Book of Allah?' He answered,
'By the One who splits the grain and creates the soul, I do not know it other
than as understanding which Allah gives to a man in the Qur'an, and what
is in this booklet.' I asked, 'What is in this booklet?' He replied, 'The
blood-wit, the ransom of captives and that a Muslim is not to be killed in
retaliation for an unbeliever.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CLIX: Ransoming idolaters</B>
<P>
2883. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that some men of the Ansar asked
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for permission
and said, "Messenger of Allah, allow us to forgo the ransom of our nephew
'Abbas." He said, "Do not forgo even a single dirham of it."
<P>
2884. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was brought some goods from Bahrayn and al-'Abbas came to
him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, give some to me, for I ransomed myself
and 'Aqil.' He said to him, 'Take some,' and he gave to him in his garment."
(see 411)
<P>
2885. It is related from Jubayr, who was taken among the captives of Badr,
"I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reciting

came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was
on a journey. He sat talking with his Companions and then left. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Go after him and kill him.'"
So he [Salama] killed him and the Prophet gave him his belongings.
<P>
<P>

they are not to be enslaved</B>
<P>

"I order him to fulfil the contract of the <I>dhimma</I> of Allah and the
<I>dhimma</I> of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and to fight for them and not to burden them with more than they can
bear."
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXII: The presents of delegations. Can one interceded for the people
of the <I>dhimma</I> and dealing with them?</B>
<P>
2888. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Thursday! What was Thursday!"
Then he wept until his tears made the pebbles wet. He said, "On Thursday
the pain of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
became intense and he said, 'Bring me some sheets so that I may write a document
for you after which you will never go astray." They quarrelled, and there
should be no quarrelling in the presence of a Prophet, and they said, 'The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is delirious.'
He said, 'Leave me, for that which I am in is better than that to which you
call me.' When he was dying, he gave three instructions: 'Expel the idolaters
from the Arabian peninsula, give presents to the delegations as you have
seen me giving them presents,' and I forgot the third."
<P>
Ya'qub ibn Muhammad said, "I asked al-Mughira ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman about the
Arabian peninsula, and he said, "Makka, Madina, Yamana and Yemen.'" Ya'qub
said, "Al-'Arj is the beginning of Tihama."
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXIII: Beautifying oneself for delegations</B>
<P>
2889. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "'Umar found a silk robe which was
being sold in the market and brought it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'Messenger of Allah, buy this robe
and you can dress yourself up with it for <I>'ids</I> and delegations.' The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'This
is the garment of one who has no share' or 'This will only be worn by someone
who has no share of the Next World.' As long as Allah willed later, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent a brocade robe to
him and 'Umar brought it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah! You said, "This is the garment
of one who has no share" or "This will only be worn by someone who has no
share of the Next World" and then you send me this!' He said, 'You are to
sell it or get what you need with it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXIV: How to offer Islam to a child</B>
<P>
2890. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "'Umar went with the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a group of the Companions of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to visit Ibn Sayyad. They
found him playing with some children in the hills of Banu Maghala. Ibn Sayyad,
who was approaching puberty, did not notice them until the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, patted him with the back of his hand and the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do you testify that
I am the Messenger of Allah?' Ibn Sayyad looked at him and said, 'I testify
that you are the Messenger of the unlettered.' Ibn Sayyad said to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Do you testify that I am the Messenger
of Allah?' He refuted it and said, 'I have believed in Allah and His Messengers.'
Then he said to him, What do you think?' Ibn Sayyad said, 'Both truthful
people and liars come to me.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'You are in a state of confusion.' the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'I am concealing something from
you.' Ibn Sayyad said, 'It is just smoke.' He said, 'Shame on you! Do not
go too far.' 'Umar said, 'Messenger of Allah, give me permission to cut his
head off?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If
it is him, you will not be able to get the better of him. If it is not him,
there is no point in killing him.'"
<P>
2891. Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and Ubayy ibn Ka'b went to the palm-grove where Ibn Sayyad was
staying and entered the palm-trees and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, began to conceal himself behind the trunks of the palm-trees.
He wanted to hear something from Ibn Sayyad without Ibn Sayyad seeing him.
Ibn Sayyad was lying down, covered by a sheet from which was coming a murmuring
sound. The mother of Ibn Sayyad saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, concealing himself among the palm trunks and she
said to Ibn Sayyad, 'Saf! (which was a name of Ibn Sayyad).' So Ibn Sayyad
got up. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If she
had left him, it would have been clear.'"
<P>
2892. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, stood up among the people and praised Allah as He deserves
and then he mentioned the Dajjal and said, 'I warn you about him, and there
is no Prophet who did not warn his people about him. Nuh warned his people
about him, but I will say something to you which no Prophet has said to his
people. You should know that he is one-eyed and that Allah is not one-eyed.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXV: The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
to the Jews, "Become Muslim and you will be safe."</B>
<P>
Al-Maqburi reported it from Abu Hurayra.(see 2996)
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXVI: When some people in the Abode of War become Muslims and possess
property and lands, their property belongs to them</B>
<P>
2893. It is related that Usama ibn Zayd said, "I said during the hajj, 'Messenger
of Allah, where will you stay tomorrow?' He asked, 'Did 'Aqil leave a house?'
Then he said, 'Tomorrow we will stay at the valley of Banu Kinana, i.e.
al-Muhassab, where Quraysh took an oath on rejection.' That was when the
Banu Kinana formed an alliance with Quraysh against the Banu Hashim agreeing
not to do business with them nor give them shelter."
<P>
Az-Zuhri said that <I>khayf</I> means valley.
<P>
2894. It is related from Aslam that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab appointed a client
of his called Hunayy over the <I>hima</I> preserve. He said, "Hunayy! Be
gentle to the Muslims and fear the supplication of the wronged, for the
supplication of the wronged is answered. Let the one who has few camels and
the owner of sheep enter. Beware of the herds of Ibn 'Awf and the herds of
Ibn 'Affan. Even if their livestock were to die, they can resort to palm-trees
and crops. If the one who has few camels and the owner of sheep were to have
their flocks perish, they would bring their sons to me and say, 'O Amir
al-Mu'minin!' Could I neglect them? No, may you be fatherless! So water and
herbage are easier for me than gold and silver. By Allah, they think that
I have wronged them. This is their land, and they fought for it in the
<I>Jahiliyya</I> and they became Muslim while they had it. By the One in
whose hand my soul is, were it not for the animals which I provide to be
ridden in the way of Allah, I would not have made a handspan of their land
into a preserve."
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXVII: The ruler writing down the people</B>
<P>
2895. It is related that Hudhayfa said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'Write down for me the people who have pronounced
Islam.' So we wrote down for him for him one thousand five hundred men. We
said, "Should we fear when we are one thousand five hundred?" We saw ourselves
being tried until the man praying alone would be fearful."
<P>
It is related that al-A'mash said, "We found them to be five hundred." Abu
Mu'awiya said, "Between six hundred and seven hundred."
<P>
2896. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A man came to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, I have
been written down for such-and-such an expedition and my wife has gone out
on hajj.' He said, 'Go and make hajj with your wife.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXVIII: Allah may support the deen by an impious man</B>
<P>
2897. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "We were present with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at Khaybar and he said
about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, 'This is one of the people of the
Fire.' When the fighting occurred, the man fought fiercely and received a
wound. It was said, 'Messenger of Allah, the one you said is one of the people
of the Fire fought today fiercely and has died.' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'To the Fire.'" He said, "Some people nearly
doubted, but while they were like that, it was said, 'He has not died, but
has a severe wound.' When night came, he could not endure the wound and he
killed himself. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
informed about that and said, 'Prophet is greater! I testify that I am the
slave of Allah and His Messenger.' Then he commanded Bilal to announce to
the people, 'Only a Muslim soul will enter the Garden, and Allah might support
this <I>deen</I> with an impious man.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXIX: The one who took command in a battle without being appointed when
ther is fear of the enemy</B>
<P>
2898. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, gave a speech and said, 'Zayd took the standard
and was struck down. Then Ja'far took it and was struck down. Then 'Abdullah
ibn Rawaha took it and was struck down. Then Khalid ibn al-Walid took it
without being appointed commander and was given victory. It would not make
us happy - or he said, 'it would not make them happy' - to have them with
us.'" He said, "He was weeping."
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXX: Supporting with reinforcements</B>
<P>
2899. It is related that Anas said, "Ri'l, Dhakwan, 'Usayya and the Banu
Lihyan came to the Prophet*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
claimed that they had become Muslim and asked for him to reinforce them against
their people. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reinforced
them with seventy of the Ansar." Anas said, "We used to call them the recitors.
They would gather firewood in the day and pray at night. They went out with
them until they reached Bi'r Ma'una, and then they betrayed them and killed
them. The (Prophet) made supplication against Ri'l, Dhakwan and Banu Lihyan
for a month."
<P>
Anas said, "They used to recite for them as Qur'an, 'Convey to our people
that we have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and We are pleased' and
then that was abrogated later."
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXXI: The one who defeated the enemy and remained in their region for
three days</B>
<P>
2900. From Abu Talha from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, is that when he had victory over a people, he would remain in the
area for three days.
<P>
It is corroborated from Qatada from Anas from Abu Talha from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXXII: The one who distributed booty in the expedition and the journey</B>
<P>
Rafi' said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, at Dhu'l-Hulayfa, and we obtained some booty and camels. He made ten
sheep equal to one camel."
<P>
2901. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, made<I> 'umra </I>from al-Ji'rana where he distributed the
booty of Hunayn."

then the Muslim finds it</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw8.html#17">2902</A>. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said that a
horse of his ran off and the enemy had taken it. The Muslims then defeated
the enemy and it was returned to him in the time of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace. A slave of his ran away and joined
the Greeks and the Muslims defeated them and Khalid ibn al-Walid returned
the slave to him after the death of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace.
<P>
2903. It is reported from Nafi' that a slave belonging to Ibn 'Umar joined
the Greeks and then Khalid ibn al-Walid defeated them and returned him to
'Abdullah, and that a horse of Ibn 'Umar fled and joined the Greeks, and
he defeated them and they returned it to 'Abdullah.
<P>
2904. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that he was on a horse on that day when
the Muslims met [the enemy] which that day was under the command of Khalid
ibn al-Walid who had been sent out by Abu Bakr. The enemy took it and then
when the enemy was defeated, Khalid returned the horse.

<B>CLXXXIV: The one who speaks Persian or other than Arabic</B>
<P>
The words if Allah Almighty<I>, "The varieties of your languages and your
colours," </I>(30:22) and<I> "We have not sent a messenger except with the
language of his people." </I>(14:4)
<P>
2905. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah &#163;said, "I said, 'Messenger
of Allah, we have slaughtered a lamb of ours and ground a <I>sa' </I>of barley.
Come with some people.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
shouted and said, 'O people of the ditch! Jabir has prepared a feast
(<I>sur</I>), so come along!'"
<P>
[<I>Sur</I> is Persian for a feast.]
<P>
2906. It is related that Umm Khalid bint Khalid ibn Sa'd said, "I went to
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with my
father wearing a yellow shirt. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'Sanah! Sanah.' ('Abdullah said that it means
"good" in Abyssinian.)" She said, "I began to play with the seal of prophethood
and my father rebuked me. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'Leave her.' Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Wear it until it is worn out and then
replace it, and wear that until it is worn out and then replace it, and then
wear that until it is worn out and then replace it.'" 'Abdullah said. "She
lived until it became brown."
<P>
2907. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Al-Husayn ibn 'Ali took a date
from the <I>sadaqa</I> dates and put it in his mouth. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said in Persian, 'No, no! * Are you not aware
that we do not eat <I>sadaqa</I>?'"
<P>
[* Kakh! Kakh!]
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXXV: Stealing from the booty</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Those who misappropriate, will arrive on
the Day of Rising with what they have misappropriated."</I> (3:161)
<P>
2908. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, stood up among us and mentioned stealing from the
booty and said it was horrendous and its business was terrible. He said,
'I would not like to find any of you coming on the Day of Rising with a bleating
sheep round his neck or a neighing horse around his neck, saying, "O Messenger
of Allah! Help me!" I will say, "I can do nothing for you now. I conveyed
the message." Nor someone with a complaining camel round his neck, saying,
"O Messenger of Allah! Help me!" I will say, "I can do nothing for you now.
I conveyed the message." Or someone with gold and silver on his neck, saying,
"O Messenger of Allah! Help me!" I will say, "I can do nothing for you now.
I conveyed the message." Or someone with rags fluttering on his neck, saying,
"O Messenger of Allah! Help me!" I will say, "I can do nothing for you now.
I conveyed the message."'"
<P>
Ayyub reported from Abu Hayyan, "A horse which is neighing."
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXXVI: A minor theft of the booty</B>
<P>
'Abdullah ibn 'Amr did not mention from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, that he burned the culprit's goods. This is sounder.
<P>
2909. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "There was a man called
Kirkara who used to look after the family and goods of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. He died and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'He is in the Fire.' They went to look
and found a cloak that he had stolen."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said that Ibn Salam said, "Karkara," and it is precisely like
that.
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXXVII: What is disliked of slaughtering camels and sheep in the booty</B>
<P>
2910. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij said, "We were with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The people were
afflicted by hunger and seized some camels and sheep as booty." He said,
"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was somewhat behind
the people and they hurried and slaughtered and set up the pots. He ordered
the pots to be upset and then divided it. Ten sheep were equal to a camel.
One of the camels fled and there were few horses among the people and they
went after it until they were exhausted. One of the men among them aimed
an arrow at it and Allah stopped the camel. Then the Prophet said, 'Some
of these animals are wild like wild animals. If you lose control over them,
then do as this man did.'" My grandfather said, "We hope - or fear - that
we may meet the enemy tomorrow and not have any knives. Can we slaughter
with reeds?" He said, "Whatever makes the blood flow and eat it when the
name of Allah has been mentioned over it. Do not [slaughter] with teeth or
nails, and I will tell you about that. Teeth are bone and the nail is the
knife of the Abyssinians.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXXVIII: Good news of victories</B>
<P>
2911. It is related that Qays said, "Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said to me, 'The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me,
"Will you not relieve me from Dhu'l-Khalasa?"' which was a house where Khath'am
was which was called the Yamani Ka'ba I set out with one hundred and fifty
horsemen from Ahmas. They are good horsemen. I informed the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, that I could not sit firm on a horse
and he (the Prophet) struck me in my chest so that I saw the marks of his
fingers on my chest. He said, "O Allah, make him firm and make him a guided
guide."' He went to it and broke it up and burnt it. Then he sent the good
news to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
Jarir's messenger said, 'By the One who sent you with the truth, I did not
come to you until I left it as if it was a scabby camel.' He said, 'May Allah
bless the horses and riders of Ahmas' five times."
<P>
Musaddad said that it was a house in Khath'am.
<P>
<P>
<B>CLXXXIX: What is given to the bringer of good news</B>
<P>
Ka'b ibn Malik gave two garments when he was given the good news of repentance.
(see 4156)
<P>
<P>
<B>CXC: There is no emigration after the Conquest of Makka</B>
<P>
2912. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "On the day of the Conquest of
Makka, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'There is no more <I>hijra</I>, but there is <I>jihad</I> and intention.
When you are called to it then go."
<P>
2913. It is related that Mujashi' ibn Mas'ud said, "Mujashi' came with his
brother, Mujalid ibn Mas'ud, to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and said, 'This is Mujalid &nbsp;who will give you allegiance
based on emigration.' He said, 'There is no emigration after the Conquest
of Makka, but I will take his allegiance on Islam '"
<P>
2914. It is related that 'Ata' said, "I went with 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr to 'A'isha
while she was near Thabir. She said to us, 'Emigration has been cut off since
Allah let his Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, conquer Makka.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>CXCI: When a man is forced to look in the hair of the people of
<I>dhimma</I> and believing women when they disobey Allah, and to strip
them</B>
<P>
2915. It is related from Sa'd ibn 'Ubayda that Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman, a 'Uthman
supporter, said to Ibn 'Atiyya, a 'Ali supporter, "I know what made your
person bold enough to shed blood! I heard him say, 'The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sent me and az-Zubayr and said, "Go to a certain
meadow and you will find a woman to whom Hatib has given a letter." We went
to the meadow and said, "The letter!" She said, "He did not give me any."
We said, "You will produce it or we will strip you," and she brought it out
of her plaits. He sent for Hatib who said, "Do not be hasty. By Allah, I
have not disbelieved nor been increased with anything but love for Islam.
There is none of your Companions who does not have relatives in Makka by
whom Allah defends their family and property. I have no one. I wanted to
have a favour with them." The Prophet said that he spoke the truth, and 'Umar
said, "Let me strike off his head! He is a hypocrite!" He said, "What will
inform you? Perhaps Allah looked down on the people of Badr and said, 'Do
what you like. I have forgiven you.'"' This is what made him bold."
<P>
<P>
<B>CXCII: Meeting the fighters</B>
<P>
2916. It is related from Ibn Abi Mulayka that Ibn az-Zubayr said to Ibn Ja'far,
"Do you remember when we - me, you and Ibn 'Abbas - met the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?" He said, "Yes, and he let
us ride and left you."
<P>
2917. It is related that as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid said, "We went to Thaniyat al-Wada'
to meet the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
with the children."
<P>
[On his return from Tabuk.]
<P>
<P>
<B>CXCIII: What one says when one returns from an expedition</B>
<P>
2918. It is related from 'Abdullah, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, returned, he would say the <I>takbir</I> three
times. He would say, '[We are] returning, Allah willing, repenting, worshipping,
praising, prostrating to our Lord. Allah has been true to His promise and
helped His slave and alone defeated the Confederates.'"
<P>
2919. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We were returning with the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from 'Usfan, and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on his she-camel with
Safiyya bint Huyayy riding behind him. The she-camel stumbled and both of
them fell off. Abu Talha leapt down and said, 'Messenger of Allah! May Allah
make me your ransom!' He said, 'See to the woman.' He wrapped a cloth over
his face and went to her and threw it on her. Then he put their camel right
and they rode. We were encircling the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. When we were overlooking Madina, he said, '[We are]
returning, repenting, worshipping, praising our Lord.' He continued to say
that until he entered Madina."
<P>
2920. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that he and Abu Talha came with the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had Safiyya riding behind him on his she-camel.
When they had gone part of the way, the she-camel stumbled and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his wife fell off. Abu Talha
(he said, "I think he said.") leapt from his camel and came to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying, 'O Prophet of
Allah! May Allah make me your ransom! Are you hurt at all?' He said, 'No,
rather see to the woman.' So Abu Talha threw a cloth over his face and went
towards her and threw his cloth over her, and the woman got up. Then he saw
them both onto their camel and they rode. They travelled until they could
see Madina - or they were looking down over Madina. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace,said, '[We are] returning, repenting,worshipping,
praising our Lord.' He continued to say it until he entered Madina."
<P>
<P>
<B>CXCIV: The prayer when one arrives from a journey</B>
<P>
2921. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to say, "I was with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey. When
we approached Madina, he said to me. 'Enter the mosque and pray two
<I>rak'ats</I>.'"
<P>
2922. It is related from Ka'b that when the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, returned from a journey in the forenoon, he entered
the mosque and prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> before he sat down.
<P>
<P>
<B>CXCV: Food on arrival</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar used to not fast because of those who came to &nbsp;see him.
<P>
2923. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that when the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, arrived in Madina, he would slaughter

Muharib heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, bought a camel from me for two <I>awqiyyas</I> and one
or two dirhams. When he reached Sirar, he commanded that a cow be slaughtered
and they ate from it. When he arrived in Madina, he commanded me to go to
the mosque and pray two <I>rak'ats </I>and weighed out for me the price of
the camel."

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Pray two <I>rak'ats</I>."
