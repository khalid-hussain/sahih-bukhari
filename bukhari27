<P>
<B>I: The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "O mankind! We created you from a male
and female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you might come to
know each other. The noblest among you in Allah's sight is the most
godfearing,"</I> (49:13) </B>
<P>
and His words, <I>"Show fear of Allah in whose name you make demands on one
another and also show fear of Him in respect of your families.Allah watches
over you continually."</I> (4:1)
<P>
<B>What is forbidden of the claims of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>.</B>
<P>
"Peoples" have distant lineage and "tribes" are closer than that.
<P>
3300. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas about <I>"He made you into peoples and
tribes" </I>that He said, "Peoples are are large tribes and tribes are
sub-groups."
<P>
3301. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that it was asked, "Messenger of
Allah, who is the noblest of people?" He replied, "The one with the most
fear of Allah." They said, "This is not what we meant." He said, "Yusuf,
the Prophet."
<P>
3302. It is related that Kulayb ibn Wa'il said, "The step-daughter of the
Prophet, Zaynab bint Abi Salama reported to me and I asked her, 'Do you think
that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was from Mudar?'
She said, 'Yes, he was indeed from Mudar, from the Banu'n-Nadr ibn Kinana.'"
<P>
3303. It is related that Kulayb ibn Wa'il said, "The step-daughter of the
Prophet, I think she was Zaynab, said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade<I> dubba', hantam, muqayyar </I>and
<I>muzaffiat</I> [different kinds of containers used for making wine]. I
said to her, 'Tell me, was the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, from Mudar?' She answered, "He was indeed from Mudar, from the descendants
of Banu'n-Nadr ibn Kinana.'"
<P>
3304. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "You will find people to be like mines. The best
of them in the <I>Jahiliyya</I> are the best of them in Islam when they have
understanding. You will find the best of people in this business (of command)
to be those who dislike it the most, and you will find the worst of people
are the two-faced who come to these people with one face and those people
with another face."
<P>
[Mines contain different minerals, some precious and some base.]
<P>
3305. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "People follow Quraysh in this business. Their
Muslim follows their Muslim, and their unbeliever follows their unbeliever.
People are like mines. The best of them in the <I>Jahiliyya</I> are the best
of them in Islam when they have understanding. You will find the best of
people in this business (of command) to be those who dislike it the most
until he comes to it."
<P>
3306. It is related from Tawus from Ibn 'Abbas about <I>"except for you to
love your near of kin" </I>(21:23) that he said that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said,
"the near of kin of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." Ibn
'Abbas said, "There was no sub-tribe of Quraysh but that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had kinship in it. It was sent down
about him and it means: you should maintain the kinship between you and him."
<P>
3307. It was related from Abu Mas'ud that it reached him that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'From here seditions
will come, towards the east. But cruelty and hard-heartedness is in those
with loud voices who are following the tails of camels - among Rabi' and
Mudar.'
<P>
3308. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Pride and arrogance are found
in the loud-voiced people of hair-tents (i.e. the nomads). Transquillity
is found with the people of sheep. Belief is Yemeni and wisdom is Yemeni."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "It was called the Yemen beause it was to the right
(<I>yaman</I>) of the Ka'ba and Syria (Sha'm) was so called because it was
to the left of Ka'ba. So you have <I>masha'ma</I> and <I>maysara</I> (left
and right side), right and left hand (<I>yusra, shu'ma</I>) and the left
side is <I>asha'm</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The virtues of Quraysh</B>
<P>
3309. Jubayr ibn Mut'im related that while he was in a delegation from Quraysh,
it reached Mu'awiya that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As related that there
would be a king from Qahtan. Mu'awiya became angry and got up and praised
Allah as He deserves and then said, "Following on from that, it has reached
me that some men among you relate things which are not in the Book of Allah
Almighty nor have been reported from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. Those are your ignorant ones. Beware of expectations
which mislead their people. I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, 'Command is in Quraysh. No one opposes them
but that Allah will overthrow him on his face - as long as they establish
the <I>deen</I>.'"
<P>
3310. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "This command will remain in Quraysh as long as
two of them remain."
<P>
3311. It is related that Jubayr ibn Mut'im said, "I and 'Uthman ibn 'Affan
went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
&nbsp;and said, 'Messenger of Allah, you have given to the Banu'l-Muttalib
and left us out although we and them have the same position with you.' He
said, 'The Banu'l-Muttalib and the Banu Hashim are the same thing.'"
<P>
3312. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said, "'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr
went with some people of the Banu Zuhra to 'A'isha, who was extremely kind
to them because of their kinship with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace."
<P>
3313. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Quraysh, the Ansar, Juhayna, Muzayna,
Aslam, Ashja' and Ghifar are my helpers and have no protector except Allah
and His Messenger.'"
<P>
3314. It is related that 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said, "'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr
was the most beloved of people to 'A'isha after the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr, and he was the most dutiful of people
to her. She would not keep anything which came to her from the provision
of Allah but that she would give it as sadaqa. Ibn az-Zubayr said, 'She must
be stopped.' She said, Will I be stopped? I vow not to speak to him!' He
asked some of the men of Quraysh to intervede with her, especially some of
the maternal uncles of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, but she refused. The Zuhrites, the maternal uncles of the Prophet,
including 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Aswad ibn 'Abdu Yaghuth and al-Miswar ibn
Makhrama, said to him, 'When we ask permission to enter, then go behind the
curtain.' He did that and sent her ten slaves, and she set them free. Then
she continued to set free until she had freed forty. She said, 'I wish that
when I made the vow, I had specified what I would do, so that I could have
finished it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The Qur'an was sent down in the language of Quraysh</B>
<P>
3315. It is related from Anas that 'Uthman summoned Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Abdullah
ibn az-Zubayr, Sa'id ibn al-'As and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham,
and they wrote down the copies of the Qur'an. 'Uthman said to the group of
the three Qurayshis, "If you disagree with Zayd ibn Thabit on anything of
the Qur'an, then write it in the language of Quraysh. It was revealed in
their language." They did that.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: The ascription of Yemen to Isma'il</B>
<P>
They included Aslam ibn Afsa ibn Haritha ibn 'Amr ibn 'Amir from Khuza'a.
<P>
3316. It is related that Salama said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, went by some people of Aslam who were shooting against one
another in the market and he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Shoot, Banu Isma'il! Your ancestor was an archer. Shoot, and I am with the
the Banu so-and-so,' to one of the two groups. They stopped shooting, and
he said, 'What is wrong with them?' They said, 'How can we shoot when you
are with them?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Shoot, and I am with all of you.'"
<P>
3317. It is related from Abu Dharr that he heard the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, "There is no man who claims to be the son of
other than his father, knowingly, but that he has disbelieved. Whoever claims
to be part of a people with whom he has no lineage should take his seat in
the Fire."
<P>
3318. It is related that Abu'l-Asqa' Wathila ibn al-Asqa' said that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "One of the greatest
untruths is that of attributing a man to other than his father or of claiming
to have seen in a dream something he did not see or of attributing a saying
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which
he did not say."
<P>
3319. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the delegation of the tribe
of 'Abdu'l-Qays came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, they said, 'O Messenger of Allah! We are from this tribe of Rabi'a.'
We can only come to you in the sacred months since there is a district of
the unbelievers of Mudar between us and you. Give us clear instructions which
we can take from you and convey to those we left behind.' He said, 'I command
you to do four things and forbade you to do four things. I command you to
testify that there is no god but Allah, to establish the prayers, to pay
the <I>zakat</I>, to fast Ramadan and to pay the <I>khums</I> (fifth) of
your booty to Allah.' He forbade them <I>dubba', hantam, naqir</I> and
<I>muzaffat</I>. [different kinds of wine vessels]"
<P>
3320. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying on the minbar,
'Sedition arises from here- pointing towards the east - from where the horn
of Shaytan appears.'"

<P>
<B>V: Concerning Aslam, Ghifar, Muzayna and Ashja'</B>
<P>
3321. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Quraysh, the Ansar, Juhayna, Muzayna,

and His Messenger.'"
<P>
3322. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said on the minbar, "May Allah forgive Ghifar!

<P>

and grant him peace, said, "May Allah keep Aslam safe! May Allah forgive
Ghifar!"
<P>
3324. It is related from Abu Bakra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Do you not think that Juhayna, Muzayna, Aslam
and Ghifar are better than Banu Tamim and Banu Asad, and than Banu 'Abdullah
ibn Ghatafan and than Banu 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'a." A man said, "They were
disappointed and lost." He said, "They are better than Banu Tamim, Banu Asad,
Banu 'Abdullah ibn Ghatafan and Banu 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'a."
<P>
3325. It is related from Abu Bakr that al-Qara' ibn Habis said to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "It was those who robbed the pilgrims
among the Aslam, Ghifar and Muzayna - and I think that he said Juhayna (Ibn
Abi Ya'qub was unsure) - who gave you allegiance. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do you not think that Aslam, Ghifar,
Muzayna - and I think that he said Juhayna - and are better than Banu Tamim,
Banu 'Amir, Asad, and Ghatafan? They were disappointed and lost." He said,
"Yes." He said, "By the One who has no soul in His hand, they are better
than them!"
<P>
3326. It is related from Abu Hurayra said that he said, "Aslam, Ghifar, and
some of Muzayna and Juhayna," or he said, "some of Juhayna or Muzayna are
better in the sight of Allah (or he said, on the Day of Rising) than Asad,
Tamim, Hawazin, and Ghatafan."

<P>
3327. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, summoned the Ansar and said, 'Is there any among you is
not from you?' They said, 'No, except for the son of a sister of ours.' The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The son
od a sister of a people is one of them."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The story of Zamzam and Abu Dharr becoming Muslim</B>
<P>
3328. It is related from Abu Jamra, "Ibn 'Abbas said to us, 'Shall I not
tell you of how Abu Dharr became Muslim?' We said, 'Yes indeed!' He said
that Abu Dharr said, "I was a man of the Ghifar and it reached us that a
man had come out in Makka who claimed to be a Prophet. I said to my brother,
'Go to this man and speak to him and bring me his news.' So he went and met
him and then returned. I asked, 'What have you got?' He replied, 'By Allah,
I saw a man who was commanding the good and forbidding evil.' I said to him,
'You have not satisfied me with your information.' So I took a bag and a
staff and set out to Makka. I did not know him and I disliked to ask about
him, and I continued to drink Zamzam water and reamined in the mosque."
<P>
He said, "'Ali passed by me and said, 'You seem to be a man who is a foreigner.'
I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Go to the house.'" He said, "I went with him and
he did not ask me about anything nor did I inform him. In the morning, I
went to the mosque to ask about him, and there was no one who told me anything
about him." He said, "'Ali passed by me and said, 'Has not the man recognised
his house yet?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Come with me.' He asked, 'What is
your business and what has brought you to this city?' I said to him, 'If
you conceal it for me, I will tell you.' He replied, 'I will do so.' I said
to him, 'It has reached me that here a man has come out claiming to be a
Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and he returned without enough
information to satisfy me. So I wanted to met him.' He said to him, 'You
have been rightly guided. I am going to him now, so follow me and enter where
I enter. If I see anyone who may cause you some alarm, I will go to the wall
as if I were fixing my sandal. Then you should go away.' So he went and I
went with him until he entered and I entered with him to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace. I said to him, 'Present Islam to me,'
and he presented it and I became Muslim straightaway. He said to me, 'O Abu
Dharr, conceal this matter and return to your land. When it reaches you that
we have been victorious, then come.' I said, 'By the One who sent you with
the truth, I will shout it out in the midst of them!'
<P>
"So he went to the mosque where Quraysh were and said, 'O company of Quraysh!
I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His
slave and His Messenger!' They said, 'Get this heretic!' And they got up
and beat me nearly to death. Al-'Abbas reached me and put himself over me
and then turned to them and said, 'Woe to you! Will you kill a man of Ghifar
when your commerce and your communications pass through Ghifar?' So they
left me. The morning of the next day I went back and said the like of what
I had said the day before. They said, 'Get this heretic!' and the like of
what had been done to me the day before was done. Al-'Abbas got to me and
put himself over me and then turned to them and said the like of what he
had said the day before." He said, "So this was the beginning of the Islam
of Abu Dharr, may Allah have mercy on him!"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Concerning Qahtan</B>
<P>
3329. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The Hour will not come until a man of Qahtan
comes forth, driving the people with his stick."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: What is forbidden of the summoning of the <I>Jahiliyya</I></B>
<P>
3330. It is related that Jabir said, "We went on an expedition with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and a lot of people of the Muhajirun
joined him. One of the Muhajirun was a man who played with spears (or played
jokes). He stroked the backside of an Ansari and the Ansari became furious
so that they each began to call for help. The Ansari said, 'O Ansar!' and
the Muhajir said, "O Muhajirun!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came out and said, 'What is this summoning of the
people of the <I>Jahiliyya</I>?' Then he asked, 'What is their problem?'
He was told about the Muhajir stroking the Ansari."
<P>
He said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"This summoning is distasteful." 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy inn Salul said, "They
have called against us. When we return to Madina, the mightier will expel
the weaker from it!" Then 'Umar said, "Messenger of Allah! Shall I not kill
this foul person?" referring to 'Abdullah. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "People will not say that he used to kill his
Companions."
<P>
3331. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Someone who slaps his cheeks and tears his shirt
and cries out with the cry of the <I>Jahiliyya</I> is not one of us."

was the father of Khuza'a."
<P>
3333. It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "The <I>bah&icirc;ra</I>
was a camel whose milk was dedicated to the idols. No one could milk it.
The <I>s&acirc;'iba</I> was a camel which was they released for their gods
and so nothing could be carried on it.
<P>
It is related that Abu Hurayra &#163; said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "I saw 'Amr ibn Luhayy al-Khuza'i dragging
his intestines in the Fire. He was the first to institute the
<I>s&acirc;'iba</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The story of Zamzam and the ignorance of the Arabs</B>
<P>
3334. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "If it will please you to know
about the ignorance of the Arabs, then read after 130 in <I>Surat al-An'am</I>:
<I>'Those who kill their children foolishly without any knowledge and make
what Allah has provided for them haram, inventing lies against Allah, such
people are lost. They are misguided. They are not guided.' </I>(6:140)."

<I>Jahiliyya</I></B>

to the subtribes of Quraysh."
<P>
It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the <I>ayat</I> was sent down,
<I>'And warn your near relatives,'</I> (26:214) the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, began to call tribe by tribe."
<P>
3336. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and said, 'O Banu 'Abd Manaf! Purchase your selves from
Allah! O Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib! Purchase your selves from Allah! O mother
of az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam, aunt of the Messenger of Allah! O Fatima daughter
of Muhammad! Purchase your selves from Allah! I cannot help you against Allah
in any way. Ask me what you wish of my property.'"

and grant him peace, unwrapped himself and said, 'Abu Bakr. It is the <I>'Id
</I>and these are the days of Mina.'"
<P>
'A'isha said, "I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,

3338. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Hassan asked the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, for permission to satirise the unbelievers.
He said, 'What about my lineage?' Hassan said, 'I will remove you from them
as one removes the hair from the dough.' 'Urwa said, "I began to abuse Hassan
in the presence of 'A'isha and she said, 'Do not abuse him. He used to defend
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: What has come about the names of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and the words of Allah Almighty, "<I>Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are fierce to the
rejectors," </I>(48:29) and His words, <I>"after me whose name is Ahmad."</I>

al-'Aqib (there will no Prophet after me.)"
<P>
3340. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Does it not amaze you who Allah averts

<P>
<P>

bless him and grant him peace, said, "My like and the like of the Prophets
is like a man who bulds a house and it is most complete and excellent with
the exception of the site of a single brick. The people begin to enter it
and admire it and say, 'If only it were not for the place of the brick!'"
<P>
3342. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "My like and the like of the Prophets
before me is like a man who bulds a house. It is most excellent and beautiful
except for the site of a single brick. People begin to go around it and admire
it and say, 'Why is not this brick put in place?'" He said, "I am the brick,
and I am the Seal of the Prophets."
<P>

Yazid when he was ninety-four, strong and upright. He said, 'I know that
what I enjoy of hearing and sight is only due to the supplication of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. My aunt went

He did <I>wudu' </I>and then he prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> with two rak'ats and
<I>'Asr</I> with two <I>rak'ats</I>, with a short spear positioned in front
of him."
<P>
Abu Juhayfa added, "While women passed in front of it. Then the people got

more fragrant than musk."
<P>
3361. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was the most generous of people, and he was
even more generous in Ramadan when Jibril met him. He used to met him every

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was more generous with good than
the blowing wind."
<P>
3362. It is related from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came into her while he was happy and &nbsp;his face

and said, "When I greeted the Messenger of Allah, &nbsp;may Allah bless him

as if it were a part of the moon. We used to recognise that in him."
<P>
3364. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah

used to part their hair. The People of the Book used to let their hair hang

liked to be in harmony with the People of the Book when he had not been commanded
anything about it. Then&nbsp;later the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, parted his hair.
<P>

He used to say, 'The best of you is the best of you in character.'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw18.html#kh2">3367</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was never given
a choice between two matters without taking the easier of them, as long as
it was not a wrong action. If it was a wrong action, he was the furthest
of people from it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, did not take revenge for himself in respect of anything unless
it violated the sanctity of Allah. Then he would take revenge for the sake
of Allah."
<P>
3368. It is related that Anas said, "I did not touch any silk brocade nor
silk softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace. I did not smell any scent sweeter than the scent or
fragrance of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."

the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prostrated, he kept
his arms out so that we could see his armpits."

<P>
3372. It is related from Anas that the may Allah bless him and grant him
peace,, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not raise his hands
in any supplication except for the Rain Prayer. Then he would raise his arms
so that the whiteness of his armpits could be seen."
<P>
3373. It is related that Abu Juhayfa said, "I happened to go the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was at al-Abtah in his
tent. It was the middle of the day and Bilal came out and gave the
<I>adhan</I> for the prayer and then he went back in. He came out with the
leftover <I>wudu'</I> water of the Messenger of Allah. The people rushed
to take some of it. Then he went inside and brought out a short spear. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out. It
is as if I could see the whitness of his legs. He put the spear upright and
then prayed <I>Dhuhr</I> with two <I>rak'ats </I>and <I>'Asr </I>with two<I>
rak'ats </I>while the donkeys and women were pasing in front of him."
<P>
3374. It is related from 'A'isha, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, used to speak so that if someone had wanted to count the number
of words, he could have done so."
<P>

surprise you that Abu so-and-so came and sat beside my room relating from
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to let me
hear that while I was doing a voluntary prayer? He got up before I had finished
my prayer. Otherwise, I would have replied to him, 'The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not speak words so rapidly as
you do.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: The eye of the Prophet used to sleep, but his heart did not sleep</B>
<P>
Sa'id ibn Mina' related it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
3376. It is related from Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman that he asked 'A'isha,
"What was the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, in Ramadan like?" She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, did not do more than eleven <I>rak'ats
</I>during Ramadan or at any other time. He would pray four <I>rak'ats </I>-
do not ask about their beauty or length - and then he would pray four more
- and do not ask about their beauty or length - and then he would pray three."
She went on, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, do you sleep before the witr?'
he said, 'My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.'"
<P>
3377. It is related from Sharik ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Namir, "I heard Anas
ibn Malik relating about the night when the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was taken from the mosque of the Ka'ba. Three individuals
came to them before he had received revelation while he was sleeping in the
Masjid al-Haram. The first of them said, 'Which one of them is he?' The middle
of them said, 'He is the best of them.' The last said, 'Take their best.'
That was that and he did not see them until they came to him on another night
in what he saw with his heart. The eyes of the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace,&nbsp;slept but his heart did not sleep. It is like that
with the Prophets. Their eyes sleep and their hearts do not sleep. Then Jibril
took charge of him and took him up the heaven."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: The signs of prophethood in Islam</B>
<P>
3378. It is related from 'Imran ibn Husayn that they were on a journey with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and they travelled
into the night until they rested when it was close to morning. Their eyes
were overcome with sleep until the sun rose. The first to wake up was Abu
Bakr. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
not woken up from his sleep until he himself woke up. Then 'Umar woke up.
Abu Bakr sat at his head and began to say the <I>takbir</I> and raise his
voice until the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, woke up.
He dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man of the people kept
himself apart and did not pray with us. When he finished, he said, "So-and-so!
What kept you from praying with us?' He answered, 'I am in <I>janaba</I>,'
so he ordered him to do <I>tayammum</I> with the bare earth. Then he prayed.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent some riders on
ahead of him and we were very thirsty indeed. While we were travelling, there
was a woman with her legs hanging down between two water bags. We asked her,
"Where is the water?" She said, 'There is no water." We said, "How far is
it between your people and the water?" She said, "A day and a night." We
said, "Come to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace." She asked, "And what is the Messenger of Allah?" We did not let her
go until we brought her to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace. She told him the like of what she had told us, but also said that
she was a widow with orphans. He commanded that her two water bags be brought
and rubbed the mouths of the skins. We were forty thirsty men and we drank
until we were quenched and we filled every waterskin and vessel we had with
us, but we did not water the camels. They were almost full to bursting. Then
he said, "Bring what food you have," and bits of bread and dates were collected
for her. When she came to her people, she said, 'I have either met the greatest
magician of people or he is a Prophet as they claim." So Allah guided the
company by that woman, and she became Muslim and they became Muslim.
<P>
3379. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was brought a vessel while he was at az-Zawra'. He placed
his hand in the vessel and the water began to flow from between his fingers.
The people did <I>wudu'</I>." Qatada said, "I asked Anas, 'How many were
you?' He said, 'Three hundred or nearly three hundred.'"
<P>
3380. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "I saw the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when the <I>'Asr</I> prayer was
near. The people were looking for<I> wudu' </I>water and did not find it.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought
<I>wudu' </I>water and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, placed his hand in that vessel. He commanded the people to do<I>
wudu'</I> from it. I saw the water flowing from between his fingers and the
people did <I>wudu'</I> until they had gone <I>wudu' to</I> the very last
one."
<P>
3381. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went out on one of his journeys and some of his
Companions were with him. They set out travelling until it was the time of
the prayer, but they did not find any water with which to do <I>wudu'</I>.
A man of the people went and brought a pot with a little water in it. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took it and did
<I>wudu'.</I> Then he extended his four fingers in the pot and then said,
'Get up and do <I>wudu</I>'.' The people did <I>wudu' </I>until all who wanted
to did <I>wudu'</I>, and there were about seventy."
<P>
3382. It is related that Anas said, "When it was near the time of the prayer
and those whose houses are near the mosque got up to do <I>wudu' </I>and
then some people remained. Then a stone vessel with some water was brought
to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he placed his
palm there, but the vessel was too small for him to expand his palm in it.
He closed his fingers and placed them in the vessel, and all the people did<I>
wudu'</I>. Humayd said, "I asked, 'How many were they?' He said, 'Eighty
men.'"
<P>
3383. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The people were thirsty
on the Day of Hudaybiyya and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, had a small vessel in front of him and he did <I>wudu'.</I> The people
rushed towards him and he asked, 'What is wrong with you?' They said, 'We
do not have any water with which to do <I>wudu' </I>or to drink except what
is in front of you.' He placed his hand in the vessel and the water began
to bubble between his fingers like fountains. We drank and did <I>wudu'</I>".
Salim ibn Abi'l-Ja'd said, "I asked, 'How many were you?' He said, 'If there
had been a hundred thousand, it would have been enough for us. We were fifteen
hundred.'"
<P>
3384. It is related that al-Bara' said, "On the Day of Hudaybiyya, we were
fourteen hundred. Al-Hubaybiyya was a well. We drew water out of it until
we did not leave a drop in it. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace,sat on the edge of the well and asked for water and rinsed his
mouth and spat it into the well. We waited a short time and then drew water
until we were quenched, and out mounts were quenched."
<P>
3385. It is related From Anas that said, "Abu Talha said to Umm Sulaym, 'I
heard the voice of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and it was weak and I recognised hunger in his voice. Do you have
anything?' She replied, 'Yes,' and produced some barley loaves. She took
a scarf of hers and wrapped up the bread in part of it and then she put it
under my garment and tied the other end of it round me. Then she sent me
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I
took it with me. I found the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, sitting in the mosque with some people. I stood over them
and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked,
'Did Abu Talha send you?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'For a meal?' I answered,
'Yes.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Get up.' Then he set off and I went on ahead of them until I came to Abu
Talha and informed him. Abu Talha said, 'Umm Sulaym! The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has come with some people, and we
do not have anything to feed them.' She said, 'Allah and His Messenger know
best.' Abu Talha went to meet the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, went forward with him until they both entered and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Bring what you
have, Umm Sulaym.' So she brought that bread and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded it to be broken up and
then Umm Sulaym squeezed some ghee on it to flavour it.' Then the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said what Allah willed
over it and then he said, 'Admit ten,' and he admitted them. They ate until
they were full and then went out. Then he said, 'Admit ten' and he admitted
them. They ate until they were full and then went out. Then he said, 'Admit
ten' and he admitted them and so on until all the people had eaten and were
full, and there were seventy or eighty men."
<P>
3386. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "We used to consider signs as a
blessing while you consider that they are to cause fear. We were with the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey
and there was little water. He said, 'Seek out the remaining water.' They
brought a vessel which contained a little water. He put his hand into the
vessel and then said, 'Come to the blessed pure water, and the blessing is
from Allah,' I saw the water flowing out from between the fingers of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we also
used to hear the glorification of the food while it was being eaten."
<P>
3387. It is related from Jabir that his father died leaving debts. [He said,]
"I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,
'My father has died leaving debts and I only have what the palm trees produce,
and what they produce for many years will not cover his debts. Come with
me so that the creditors will not be excessive towards me.' He walked around
one of the piles of dates and made supplication, and then other, and then
he sat on it and said, 'Bring it out,' and he settled what they were owed
and the like of what he had given them remained."
<P>
3388. It is related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr: "The People of the
Suffa were poor people and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'Whoever has food for two should invite a third. If he has enough
for four, he should invite a fifth or a sixth,' or words to that effect.
Abu Bakr took three and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
took ten. Abu Bakr took three." He said, "There was me and my father and
mother (The narrator said, "I do not know if he said, 'My wife and our servant
who was shared between us and Abu Bakr's house.') Abu Bakr went to eat with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and stayed until<I>
'Isha' </I>was prayed and then went back again and stayed until the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had eaten. Then Abu Bakr
came after as much of the night had passed as Allah willed and his wife said
to him, 'What kept you from your guests?' - or she said, 'your guest.' He
said, 'Haven't you given them their meal?' She said, 'They refused until
you came. They offered it to them and they refused.' I went away and hid.
Abu Bakr called out, 'O Ghunthar!' and wished my ears cut off and abused
me. Then he said, 'Eat!,' adding, 'I will never eat it!'" He said, "By Allah,
with every mouthful of it we took, more appeared underneath - until they
were full and there was more food than there had been before. Abu Bakr looked
at it and there was as much as there had been or more and he said to his
wife, 'Sister of the Banu Firas!' She said, 'No, apple of my eye, there is
now three times as much as there was before.' So Abu Bakr ate from it and
said, 'That was from Shaytan,' meaning his oath. Then he ate a mouthful of
it and took the dish to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and it remained with him until the morning. There had been a treaty between
us and some people and it had come to an end, so he divided us up into twelve
men, each of whom had a group with him - only Allah knows how many there
were with each man - and everyone of them ate from it."
<P>
3389. It is related that Anas said, "The people of Madina suffered a drought
in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace. While the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was giving the <I>khutba</I> on the day of <I>Jumu'a</I>, a man stood up
and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, the horses are dying and the sheep are dying,
so pray to Allah to give us rain.' He raised his hands and prayed." Anas
said, "The sky was clear as a bell [lit. glass] and then a wind blew up,
forming clouds and then they gathered together and then the heavens opened
up. We went out wading throught the water until we reached our houses. We
continued to have rain until the next <I>Jumu'a</I>. That man or someone
else stood up and said, 'The houses are collapsing, so pray to Allah to hold
it back.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smiled and
said, 'O Allah, around us and not on us.' I looked at the clouds and they
cleared away from Madina as if it was in a crown."
<P>
3390. It is related from Ibn 'Umar, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to give the <I>khutba</I> leaning on a palm trunk.
When he took the minbar, he moved to it and the trunk moaned and he went
to it and placed his hand of it."
<P>
It is related from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
3391. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to say, "On the Day
of <I>Jumu'a,</I> the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used
to stand by a tree or a palm. A woman - or man - of the Ansar asked, 'O Messenger
of Allah, shall we make a minbar for you?' He replied, 'If you like.' So
they made a minbar for him. When the minbar was made for him, on the Day
of <I>Jumu'a</I>, he moved to the minbar and the palm tree cried like a child.
Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came down and
embraced it, and it began to sob like a child being quietened. He said, 'It
was crying for what is used to hear of the remembrance by it.'"
<P>
3392. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to say, "The mosque
was roofed over with palm-trunks, and there was a palm trunk which the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to stand by when he gave the
<I>khutba</I>. When the minbar was made for him and he was on it , we heard
the trunk making a sound like a pregnant she-camel until the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came down and placed his hand on it
and it became quiet."
<P>
3393. It is related that Hudhayfa said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab asked, 'Who
among you remembers the <I>hadith</I> of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, about the trials (<I>fitna</I>)?'" Hudhayfa
said, "I remember it as he said it." He said, "Come on then! You are bold
enough for it." He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'A man's trial regarding his wife, children and neighbours
is wiped out by the prayer, <I>sadaqa</I> and commanding the right and forbidding
the wrong.'" 'Umar said, "This is not it. Rather I meant that which will
spread like the waves of the sea." He said, "You need not worry about it,
Amir al-Mu'minin. There is a locked door between you and it." He said, "Will
the door be opened or broken down?" He said, "No, it will be broken." He
said, "When it is broken, it will never be closed again?" He said, "Yes,
as there will be night before tomorrow. I related to him a <I>hadith</I>
without errors." Abu Wa'il said, "We were afraid to ask him and told Masruq,
'Ask him.' He asked, 'Who is the door?' and he said, ''Umar.'
<P>
3394. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The Final Hour will not come until you fight
a people who wear hair sandals, and until you fight the Turks, with small
eyes, red faces and flat noses. It is as if their faces were shields covered
with skin. You will find the best of people in this business (of authority)
to be those who dislike it the most until they are forced to it. People are
like mines. The best of them in the Jahiliyya are the best of them in Islam.
A time will come when one of you would love to see me more than having his
family and property doubled."
<P>
3395. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The Final Hour will not come until you fight
Khuz and Kirman among the non-Arabs, who have red faces, flat noses and small
eyes. Their faces are like shields covered with skin and they have hair sandals."
<P>
Someone else corroborated it from 'Abdu'r-Razzaq.
<P>
3396. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I kept the company of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for three days and in
my years I have never so anxious to retain <I>hadith</I> as I was in them.
I heard him say, and he was indicating with his hand like this, 'Before the
Final Hour you will fight a people who have hair sandals.' They are those
who have come out." Sufyan said another time, "They are the people of al-Bariz."
<P>
3397. It is related that 'Amr ibn Taghlib said, "I heard the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Before the Final Hour you will
fight a people who wear hair sandals, and you will fight a people with faces
like shields covered with skin.'"
<P>
3398. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'You will fight the Jews until
you have power over them and the rock will say, "Muslim! This is a Jew behind

on expeditions. It will be said, 'Is there any among you who kept the company
of the Prophet?' It will be said, "Yes.' And victory will be given. Then

you who kept the company of the Companions of the Prophet?' It will be said,
"Yes.' And victory will be given."

Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a men came to him and
complained of poverty to him and then another came and complained about highway
robbery. He asked, ''Adi, have you seen Hira?' I replied, 'I have not seen
it. I have been told about it.' He said, 'If you live for a long time, you
will see a woman in a camel-sedan travel from Hira until she goes aroung
the Ka'ba, not having any fear of anyone except Allah.' I said to myself,
'What will happen to the robbers of Tayy who have caused troubles in the
land?' 'If you live a long time, the treasures of Chosroes will be opened
up.' I asked, 'Chosroes ibn Hurmuz?' He said, 'Chosroes ibn Hurmuz. If you
live long enough, you will see a man going out with his palm full of gold
or silver, seeking someone to accept it from him, but not finding anyone
to accept it from him. Each of you will meet Allah on the day he meets Him
with no interpreter to interpret for him, between him and Allah and He will
say, "Did I not send a Messenger to you?" and he will reply, "Yes." He will
say, "Did I not give you wealth and children and bestow bounty on you?" He
will reply, "Yes." Then he will look to his right and see nothing but Jahannam
and then to his left and see nothing but Jahannam."'"
<P>
'Adi said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
say, 'Protect yourselves from the Fire, even if with only half a date or,
if he cannot manage even that, then with a good word.'"
<P>
'Adi said, "I saw a woman in a camel-sedan travel from Hira until she goes
aroung the Ka'ba, not having any fear of anyone except Allah, and I was one
of those who opened the treasures of Chosroes ibn Hurmuz. If you live long
enough, you see what the Prophet Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'he will go out with his palm full...'"

after me, but I fear for you that you will fight one another for them (the
treasures).'"

brought us this good. Is there any evil after good?' He answered, 'Yes.'
I asked, 'Is there any good after that evil?' He said, 'Yes, but it will
be mixed.' I asked, 'What is it that is mixed with it?' He replied, 'Some
people will guide people by other than my guidance. You will see what they
do and dislike it.' I asked, 'Is there any evil after that good?' He said,
'Yes, those who invite to the gates of Jahannam. If someone responds to them,
they will throw him into it.' I said, 'Messenger of Allah, describe them
for me.' He said, 'They are from our race and they speak our language.' I
said, 'What do you command me to do if I encounter that?' He said, 'Cling
to the community of the Muslims and their leader.' I asked, 'And if there
they have neither community nor leader?' He said, 'Then keep apart from all
those sects, even if you bite the root of a tree until death takes you while
you are like that.'"

thirty of them, all of whom claim to the Messenger of Allah."

3414. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "When we were with&nbsp;the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was making a division
of booty, Dhu'l-Khuwaysira, a man of the Banu Tamim, came to him and said,
'O Messenger of Allah, be just!!' He said to him, 'Woe to you! Who will be
just if I am not just? You are disappointed and have lost if I am not just.'
'Umar said, 'O Messenger of Allah, give me permission to cut off his head!'
He said, 'Leave him. He has companions whose prayer and fasting makes your
seem paltry. They recite the Qur'an and it does not pass beyond their throats.
They will leave the <I>deen</I> like the arrow passes through game. He looks
at his arrowhead and there is nothing on it. Then he looks at the mount of
its head and there is nothing on it. He will look at its shaft and there
is nothing on it. Then he will look at its feathers and there will be nothing
on them, for it has been too fast for excrement and blood. Their sign will
be a black man, one of whose arms is like a woman's breast, or a piece of
meat palpitating. They will emerge when there are parties among the people.'"
<P>
Abu Sa'id said, "I testify that I heard this hadith from the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I testify that 'Ali ibn
Abi Talib fought them while I was with him. He ordered that that man be sought
out and he was brought and I looked at him and he had the description which
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had given."
<P>
3415. It is related that 'Ali said, "I relate to you from the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, because I would rather fall
from the sky than to lie against him. When I tell you something that is between
me and you, war is deception. I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, 'Some young and foolish people will come at
the end of time who will speak from the best words of mankind and will leave
Islam like the arrow passes through game. Their faith does not go beyond
their throats. Kill them wherever you meet them. On the Day of Rising the
one who kills them will have a reward for killing them.'"

3416. It is related that Khabbab ibn al-Aratt said, "We complained to the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was
using his cloak as a cushion in the shade of the Ka'ba. We said to him, 'Will
you not ask for help for us? Will you not pray to Allah for us?' He said,
'Among those before you a man would be placed in a ditch which was dug for
him in the earth. Then a saw would be &nbsp;brought and placed on his head
and he would be cut in two but that would not deter him from his <I>deen</I>.
He would be raked with iron combs which would remove his flesh from his bones
or sinews, but that would not deter him from his <I>deen</I>. By Allah, this
business will be complete so that a traveller can go from San'a' to Hadramawt
fearing only Allah, or the wolf for his sheep, but you are trying to hasten
things.'"
<P>
3417. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless

of Allah, I will find out about him for you." He went to him and found him
sitting in his house, head hanging down. He asked, "What is the matter with
you?" He replied, "Evil. Someone used to raise his voice above the voice
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so his actions have
come to nothing and he is one of the people of the Fire." The man went and
informed him that he had said such-and-such. 
<P>
Musa ibn Anas said, "The man returned another time to him bearing immense
good news." He said, 'Go to him and tell him, "You are not one of the people
of the Fire. You are one of the people of the Garden."'"

3418. It is related from al-Bara' ibn 'Azib, "A man recited <I>Surat
al-Kahf</I>. There was a riding animal in the house which began to shy away.
He gave the <I>salam</I> and there was a mist or cloud covering him. He mentioned
that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who said. 'Recite,
so-and-so, for it is the <I>sakina</I> which descended for the Qur'an - or
which comes down for the Qur'an.'"
<P>
3419. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "Abu Bakr came to my father
in his house and purchased a saddle from him. He said to 'Azib, 'Send your
son to carry it with me.' So I carried it with him and my father went out
to receive its price. My father said to him, 'O Abu Bakr! Relate to me what
happened when you travelled by night with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.' He said, 'Yes, we travelled the night and
part of the following day until it was the middle of day and the road was
empty and no one was passing on it. A tall rock appeared before us which
had shade and to which the sun had not reached. So we dismounted there and
I levelled a place for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
to sleep with my hands and spread out a hide over it. I said, 'Sleep, Messenger
of Allah, and I will keep the dust from you (or guard you).' He went to sleep
and I began to keep the dust away around him. Then there was a shepherd coming
with his sheep towards the rock, intending what we had intended from it.
I asked, 'Whose servant are you?' He said, "A man of Madina or Makka.' I
said, 'Do your sheep have any milk?' He answered, 'Yes.' I asked, 'Will you
milk them?' He said, 'Yes.' He took one of his sheep. I said, "Clean the
dust, hairs and dirt from the teats." (He said, 'I saw al-Bara' clapping
one of his hands against the other for cleaning.') He milked a little milk
into a wooden vessel. I had a leather container with me which I carried for
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from which he had water
for drinking and doing <I>wudu'</I>. I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, but I did not want to wake him up, but I found that
he had already woken up. I poured water over the milk until its bottom was
cold. Then I said, "Drink, Messenger of Allah." He drank so that I was pleased.'
Then he asked, 'Is it time to leave?' I said, 'Yes,' and we travelled after
the sun had begun to decline. Suraqa ibn Malik had followed us and I said,
"We have been discovered, Messenger of Allah!" He said, "Do not grieve. Allah
is with us." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, invoked
against him and his horse sunk with him up to its belly. (I think he said,
"Into solid earth." Zuhayr is unsure.) He said, "I see that you have invoked
against me, so make supplication for me. By Allah, I will make those who
are seeking you turn back." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, made supplication for him and he was saved. Whenever he met anyone,
he said, "I have spared you from looking here." So he made whomever he met
turn back and fulfilled his promise to us.'"
<P>
3420. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went to visit a sick bedouin. When the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, visited a sick person, he would say,
"No harm, it is purification if Allah wills." So he said to him, "No harm,
it is purification if Allah wills." He answered back, "You say, 'Purification'?
No indeed. Rather it is a fever which boils or burns in old man which will
lead him to the graves." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Yes, then may it be so."
<P>
3421. It is related that Anas said, "There was a Christian man who became
Muslim and recited <I>al-Baqara</I> and <I>Ali 'Imran.</I> He used to act
as a scribe for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Then
he reverted to being a Christian and he used to say, 'Muhammad only knows
what I wrote for him.' Allah made him die and they buried him. In the morning,
the earth had thrown him up. They said, 'This is the work of Muhammad and
his Companions since he fled from them. They dug our companion up and threw
him out.' So they dug a very deep grave and in the morning the earth had
thrown him up. They said, 'This is the work of Muhammad and his Companions
since he fled from them. They threw him out.' So they dug a grave for him
as deep as they could and in the morning the earth had thrown him up. So
they knew that it was not done by people so they left him [there]."

3422. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah

their treasures in the way of Allah."

the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and said, 'If Muhammad delegates authority to me after him, I will follow
him.' He came there with a large number of his people. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to him with Thabit ibn Qays
ibn Shammas. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
had a piece of palm branch in his hand. He stood before Musaylima with his
Companions. He said, 'Even if you were to ask me for this piece, I would
not give it you. You will not escape Allah's command about you. If you turn
your back, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are the one about whom
I have been shown what I was shown.'"
<P>
Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "While I was asleep, I saw two gold bracelets on my arm
and they worried me. Then it was revealed to me in the dream to blow them
off, and I blew them off and they flew away. I interpreted them as two liars
who would emerge after me." One of them was al-'Ansi and the other was Musaylima
the Liar, the master of the Yamama.
<P>
3425. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "I saw in a dream that I was emigrating from Makka
to a land with some palm trees. It went and I thought that it was Yamama
or Hajar. Then it was Madina, Yathrib. In this dream, I dreamt that I brandished
a sword and its blade broke. It was what was inflicted on the believers on
the Day of Uhud. Then I brandished it again and it was restored better than
it was. That was what Allah brought of the Conquest and the gathering of
the believers. In it I saw cattle, and (heard), 'By Allah, good,' and they
were the believers on the Day of Uhud. The good is what Allah brought of
good, and the reward of truthfulness which Allah gave us after the Day of
Badr."

Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Welcome, my daugher!'
and he had her sit to his right or to his left and then she confided something
to her and she wept. I asked her, 'What made you weep?' Then he confided
something to her and she laughed. I said, 'I have never seen happiness so
near to sorrow as today!' I asked her about what he had said and she replied,
'I will not divulge the secret of the Messenger of Allah.' When the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, I asked her and she said,
'He confided to me, "Jibril used to present the Qur'an to me once a year.
This year, he has presented it to me twice. I only think that my time is
approaching, and you will be the first of the people of my house to join
me." So I wept. Then he said, "Are you not pleased that you will be the mistress
of the women of the people of the Garden? - or the women of the believers?"
and I laughed at that.'"
<P>
3427. It is related that 'A'isha said, "In his illness from which he died,
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for his daughter
Fatima. He confided something to her and she wept. Then he called her and
confided to her and she laughed. I asked her about that and she said, 'The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, confided to me and informed
me that he would die in the illness in which he died, so I wept. Then he
informed me that I would be the first of the people of his house to follow
him, and so I laughed.'"

Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, being informed
of his term.' He said, 'I do not know other than what you know of it.'"

in which he died, wearing a large wrapper and his head bound with an oiled
band. He sat on the minbar and praised Allah and glorified Him and then said,
'Following on from that, people will increase but the Ansar will diminish
until, in relation to people, they are like the salt in the food. Whoever
of you comes to rule and is able to bring harm to some people and benefit
to others should accept the good among them and pardon any of them who act
badly.' It was the last gathering in which he was present."

attention and then do <I>tawaf</I>.' While Sa'd was doing <I>tawaf</I>, Abu
Jahl appeared. He demanded, 'Who is this doing <I>tawaf</I> of the Ka'ba?'
Sa'd replied, 'I am Sa'd.' Abu Jahl said, 'Do you do <I>tawaf</I> of the
Ka'ba in safety while you have given shelter to Muhammad and his Companions?!'
He answered, 'Yes,' and they began to quarrel. Umayya said to Sa'd, 'Do not
raise your voice to Abu'l-Hakam. He is the master of the people of the valley.'
Then Sa'd said, 'By Allah, if you prevent from doing <I>tawaf</I> of the
House, I will cut off your trade with Syria!' Umayya was saying to Sa'd,
'Do not raise your voice,' and began to hold on to him. Sa'd became angry
and said, 'Let me alone! I heard Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant

He said, 'By Allah, Muhammad does not lie when he speaks.' He returned to
his wife and said, 'Do you know what my brother of Yathrib said to me?' She
asked, 'What did he say?' He said, 'He claims that he heard Muhammad assert
that he will kill me.' She said, 'By Allah, Muhammad does not lie!' When
they went out to Badr and the announcer came, his wife said to him, 'Do you
not recall what your brother of Yathrib said to you?' He said, 'I do not
want to go out.' Abu Jahl said to him, 'You are one of the nobles of the

in the Torah about stoning?' They said, 'We disgrace them and they are flogged.'
'Abdullah ibn Salam said, 'You have lied. Stoning is in it.' They brought
the Torah and oepned it and one of them placed his hand over the verse of
stoning and read what was before and after it. 'Abdullah ibn Salam said,
'Remove your hand.' He removed his hand and there was the verse of stoning.
They said, 'He spoke the truth, O Muhammad. It contains the verse of stoning.'

3442. It is related that Mu'awiya said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'A group of my community will
remain straight following the command of Allah and they will not be harmed
by the one who disappoints them or by the one who opposes them until the
Command of Allah comes to them while they are like that."
<P>
Malik ibn Yukhamir said that Mu'adh said, "And they are in Syria." Mu'awiya

<P>
[The command of Allah is said to either mean when their souls are taken at
death or the Last Day.]

3443. It is related from 'Urwa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, gave him a dinar with which to buy a sheep, and with it
he bought two sheep. Then he sold one of them for a dinar and brought the
dinar and the sheep, and he prayed for him to have blessing in his business
dealings. So even if he were to buy dust, he would have a profit in it.
<P>
It is related that 'Urwa said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, say, 'Good is tied to the forelocks of horses until
the Day of Rising." He [Shabib] said, "I saw seventy horses in his house."
Sufyan said that he had purchased a sheep for it as if it were for a sacrifice.
<P>
3444. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There will be good in the forelocks
of horses until the Day of Rising." 
<P>
3445. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Good is tied in the forelocks of horses."
<P>
3446. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Horses are for three purposes. They
are a reward for one man, and a shelter for another man and a burden for
another man. As for the one who has a reward, that is the man who ties them
in the way of Allah and gives them a long tether in pasture or meadow. He
will have good deeds for whatever it gets from the pasture or the meadow
for the extent of its tether. If it breaks its tether and crosses a hill
or two, then he has good deeds for its dung. If it crosses a river and drinks
from it, that will be considered good deeds for him even if he did not intend
to give it water. There is a man who ties them up in order to be self-sufficient
(from people), as a shelter and to be able to refrain from asking from them,
and then he does not forget the right of Allah on their necks (i.e.
<I>zakat</I>) and their backs (i.e. overloading them), they are a shelter
for him. There is a man who ties them up out of boasting and showing-off
and enmity towards the people of Islam, so they are a burden " The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked about donkeys
and said, "Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this general
single verse<I>, 'Whoever has done an atom's weight of good will see it and
whoever has done an atom's weight of evil will see it.'</I>" (99:7-8)
<P>
3447. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to Khaybar in the early morning
when they had come out with spades. When they saw him, they said, 'Muhammad
and the army!' and turned and ran back to the fort. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, raised his hands and said, 'Allah is greater!
Khaybar is destroyed. When we alight in the yard of a people, it is a bad
morning indeed for those who have been warned.'"
<P>
3448. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah,
I hear many <I>hadiths</I> from you which I forget.' He said, 'Spread out
your cloak.' I spread it out, he scooped with his hands and then said, 'Embrace
it.' I embraced it at my chest and never forgot anything after that."
