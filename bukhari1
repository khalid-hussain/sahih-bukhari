Revelation</A></BIG></B>
<P>
<P>
<B>I. How the revelation to the Messenger of Allah , may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, began and the words of Allah, <I>"We have revealed to
you as We revealed to Nuh and the Prophets who came after him."
</I>(4:162)</B>
<P>
<P>
1. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said on the minbar,
"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
say, 'Actions are but judged according to intentions. Every man has what
he intends. So whoever emigrates to gain something of this world or to marry
a woman, his emigration is for that to which he emigrated.'"
<P>
2. 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin, may Allah be pleased with her, said that al-Harith
ibn Hisham asked the Messenger of Allah, "Messenger of Allah! How does the
revelation come to you?"
<P>
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Sometimes
it comes to me like the ringing of a bell - and this is the hardest on me
- which then leaves me after I have fully understood and retained what was
said. Sometimes the angel comes to me in the form of a man and speaks to
me and I retain what he says."
<P>
'A'isha, may Allah be pleased with her, said, "I saw him when the revelation
was descending on him on a very cold day and when it left him his brow was
dripping with perspiration."
<P>
3. 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin, may Allah be pleased with her, said, "The beginning
of the revelation to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, took the form of the true dream. Whenever he had this kind of
dream, it was clear like the break of day [and was true]. Then he was made
to love retreat and used to go into retreat in the cave of Hira' where he
would devote himself to the worship of Allah alone, continuing in this worship
for a number of nights until he felt inclined to return to his family. He
would take provision for his stay. Then he would return to Khadija to restock
with provision to do the same again. This lasted until the Truth came to
him while he was in the cave of Hira'.
<P>
The angel came to him and said, 'Read!' He said, 'I cannot read.'"
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "He seized me
and squeezed me until all the strength went out of me and then released me
and said, 'Read !' I said, 'I cannot read.' Then he seized me and squeezed
me a second time until all the strength when out of me and then released
me. Then he seized me and squeezed me a third time and then released me,
and then he said<I>, 'Recite: In the Name of your Lord who created, created
man from a blood clot. Recite: And your Lord is the Most Generous.'</I>"
<P>
[She went on,] "Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace,returned with that and his heart was quaking. He came to Khadija
bint Khuwaylid, may Allah be pleased with her, and said, 'Wrap me up! Wrap
me up!' They wrapped him up until the state of terror had left him and then
he told Khadija what had happened and said, 'I am afraid for myself.' Khadija
said, 'No, by Allah, Allah would never bring disgrace upon you. You maintain
ties of kinship, bear people's burdens, help the destitute, give hospitality
to your guests and help those who have been afflicted by calamities.'
<P>
"Khadija then went with him to Waraqa ibn Nawfal ibn Asad ibn 'Abdu'l-'Uzza,
Khadija's cousin, who had become Christian during the <I>Jahiliyya</I>. He
could write in Hebrew and wrote in Hebrew as much of the Gospel as Allah
willed. He was an old man who had gone blind. Khadija said to him, 'Cousin!
Listen to your nephew.' Waraqa said to him, 'Nephew, what have you seen?'
The Messenger of Alla, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told him
what he had seen. Waraqa said to him, 'This is the Namus [Jibril] which Allah
sent to Musa. I wish that I were still young. I wish I might still be alive
when your people drive you out!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, asked, 'Will they drive me out?' He said, 'Yes,
no man has brought anything similar to what you have brought without being
treated with hostility. If I am still alive on that day, I will give you
my strong support.' Shortly after that, Waraqa died and there was a pause
in the revelation."
<P>
4. Jabir ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari said that while speaking about the intermission
of the revelation that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "While I was out walking, I suddenly heard a voice from heaven. I raised
my eyes and there was the same angel who had come to me at Hira'. He was
sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was afraid of him and
returned home and said, 'Wrap me up! Wrap me up!' Then Allah sent down,<I>
'O you enveloped in your cloak! Arise and warn.'</I>.... up to <I>'and shun
all filth.'</I> After that revelation became intensive and continuous."
<P>
['Abdullah ibn Yusuf and Abu Salih corroborated with him. Hilal ibn Raddad
corroborated with him in relating from az-Zuhri. Yunus and Ma'mar used the
word <I>bawadiruhu</I> instead o<I>f fu'aduhu</I>.]
<P>
5. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that Ibn 'Abbas said about the words of Allah
the Almighty, <I>"Do not move your tongue trying to hasten it"</I> (75:16):
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
experience hardship while receiving the revelation and he used to move his
lips [for committing it into memory instantly]." Ibn 'Abbas said, "I am moving
my lips for you as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, moved his." Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I am moving my lips as I saw
Ibn 'Abbas moving his," and he moved his lips.
<P>
"So Allah the Almighty sent down,<I> 'Do not move your tongue trying to hasten
it. Its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.' </I>He said that
'collecting it' means 'in your heart and your reciting it [as it was
revealed]'.<I> 'So when We recite it, follow its recitation,'</I> means 'listen
and be silent'.<I> 'Then its explanation is also Our responsibility</I>'
means that it is up to Us when you recite it. After that, the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would listen when Jibril
came to him. When Jibril left, then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace,would recite it as Jibril had recited it."
<P>
6. Ibn 'Abbas related saying, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was the most generous of people, and he was even more
generous in Ramadan when Jibril met him. He used to met him every night in
Ramadan to go through the Qur'an with him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was more generous with good than the blowing
wind."
<P>
7. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said that Abu Sufyan ibn Harb informed him that Heraclius
had sent a message to him while he was with a Qurayshi caravan composed of
merchants who were trading in Syria during the period when the the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had a truce with Abu Sufyan
and the unbelievers of Quraysh. So they went to Heraclius who was in Ilya'
[Jerusalem] and he invited them into his assembly where he was surrounded
by the great men of Byzantium. He called for his translator and said, "Who
among you is closest in lineage to this man who claims that he is a Prophet?"
Abu Sufyan said, "I am the nearest to him in lineage." Heraclius said, "Give
him leave to come near to me and bring his companions near and put them behind
him." Then he said to his translator, "Tell them that I am going to ask him
about this man. If he tells me a lie, then call him a liar."
<P>
Abu Sufyan said, "By Allah, if I had not been afraid that they would transmit
a lie from me [later on], I would have lied about him. The first question
he asked me about him was, 'What is his lineage among you?' I replied. 'He
belongs amongst us to a noble lineage.' Then he asked, 'Has anyone of your
people ever said what he says before him?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Was any
of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Do the nobles or the humble
people follow him?' I replied, 'The humble people.' He asked, 'Are they on
the increase or decrease?' I said, 'They are on the increase.' He asked,
' Does any of them become displeased with his religion and apostatize after
entering it?' I said, 'No.' He asked, 'Did you suspect him of being a liar
before he said what he said?" I said, 'No.' He asked, 'Does he act
treacherously?' I said, 'No. We are in a time of truce with him but we do
not know what he will do during it.' I could not find anything to add to
what I said except this sentence.' He asked, 'Have you fought him?' I said,
'Yes.' He went on, 'How did your fight against him go?' I said, 'Success
in the war alternated between us - sometimes he would get the better of us
and sometimes we of him.' He said, 'What does he order you to do?' I replied,
'He tells us to worship Allah alone and not associate anything with Him and
to abandon what our ancestors said. He commands us to pray, to speak the
truth, to be chaste, and to maintain ties of kinship.'
<P>
"Heraclius told the translator to say: 'I asked you about his lineage and
you mentioned that he has noble lineage; in the same way all the Messengers
who were sent came from noble lineage among their peoples. I asked you whether
anyone else among your people had said such a thing and you said they had
not. If anyone had said this before him, I would have said that he was a
man following the precedent of something said before. I asked you whether
any of his ancestors was a king and you said no. If one of his ancestors
had been a king, I would have said that he was a man seeking the kingdom
of his ancestors. I asked you whether you accused him of being a liar before
he said what he said and you said that you did not. I do not understand how
someone would refuse to lie about people and then tell lies against Allah.
I asked you whether the nobles or humble people followed him and you said
that the humble people followed him. They are always the ones who follow
the Messengers. I asked you whether they were on the increase or decrease
and you said that they were on the increase. That is what happens with belief
until it is complete. I asked you whether anyone had apostatized out of dislike
for his religion after he had entered and you said that they had not. That
is how it is with belief when its joy mixes with the hearts. I asked you
whether he had been treacherous and you said no. That is how it is with the
Messengers. I asked you what he commanded and you mentioned that he commanded
you to worship Allah and not associate anything with him and forbade you
to worship idols, and he commanded you to pray, speak truthfully, and be
chaste. If what you said is true, then he will soon control this place where
my feet are now standing. I knew that he was going to appear, but I did not
know that it would be from you. If I knew that I could reach him, I would
set out to meet him. If I were with him, I would wash his feet.'
<P>
"Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah which Dihya had
brought to the governor of Busra, who in turn passed it on to Heraclius.
He read it out, saying, 'In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the
Compassionate, from Muhammad, the slave of Allah and His Messenger, to Heraclius,
ruler of the Byzantines. Peace be upon the one who follows guidance. I call
you to Islam. If you become Muslim, you will be safe and Allah will double
your reward. If you turn away, then you incur the wrong action of your subjects.
<I>"O People of the Book! Come to a proposition which is the same for us
and you &#150; that we should worship none but Allah and not attribute any
partners to Him and not take one another as lords besides Allah. If they
turn away, say, "Bear witness that we are Muslims.</I>" (3:64)'"
<P>
Abu Sufyan said, "When Heraclius finished saying what he had said and had
read the letter, there was a great uproar there and voices were raised. We
were turned out. When we were turned out, I said to my companions, 'This
business of Ibn Abi Kabsha has become so prominent that he alarms even the
King of the Greeks.' Then I became certain that he would be victorious until
Allah brought me to Islam."
<P>
Ibn an-Nazur was the governor of Ilya' (Jerusalem) under Heraclius and was
the head of the Christians of Syria. Ibn an-Nazur relates that when Heraclius
came to Jerusalem, he got up one day in the morning in an ill-temper. Some
of his priests said, "Your appearance causes us concern." Ibn an-Nazur said
that Heraclius was an astrologer who looked at the stars. When they questioned
him, he said, "Last night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the king
of the circumcised had appeared. Who among this nation practise circumcision?"
They said, "Nobody except the Jews and you should not be worried about them.
Write to the cities under your command ordering the execution of all the
Jews in them." While they were discussing it, a man sent by the King of Ghassan
came to Heraclius to tell him the news about the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
When Heraclius learned about it, he said, "Go and see whether the messenger
is circumcised or not." They looked at him and told him that he was circumcised.
Heraclius asked him about the Arabs and he said that they practised circumcision.
Heraclius said, "It is the sovereignty of this nation which has appeared."
Then Heraclius wrote to a friend of his in Rome who was his equal in knowledge.
Heraclius went to Homs and stayed in Homs until he received a letter from
his friend agreeing with Heraclius' opinion about the emergence of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and that he was indeed a Prophet.
Heraclius invited the great men of Byzantium to a villa of his in Homs. Then
he commanded that the doors be shut and came out and said, "People of Byzantium!
If you desire success, right guidance and for your kingdom to remain firm,
then offer allegiance to this Prophet [by following him]." The people ran
to the gates like wild asses and found them closed. Heraclius saw their aversion
and despaired of their believing. He said, "Bring them back to me." He then
said, "What I just said was to test your strength in your deen (religion),
and I have seen it." So they prostrated to him and were pleased with him.
That was the end of the business which is related about Heraclius.

<P>
<B>I. On belief and the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, "Islam is based on five things."</B>
<P>
Belief is both word and action, and it increases and decreases. Allah the
Almighty says, <I>"Thus increasing their belief with more belief" </I>(48:4)
and <I>"We increased them in guidance"</I> (18:13)<I> "Allah increases those
who are guided with greater guidance." </I>(19:76) <I>"He increases in guidance
those who are already guided and gives them fear of Him."</I> (47:17)<I>
"So those who believe might increase in their belief."</I> (74:31<I>) "'Which
of you has this increased in belief?' As for those who believe, it increases
them in belief." </I>(9:124) Allah says,<I> 'The people have gathered against
you so fear them.' But that merely increased them in belief "</I> (3:177)
Allah says, <I>"It only increased them in faith and in submission."</I> (33:22)
<P>
Loving for the sake of Allah and hating for the sake of Allah is part of
belief.
<P>
'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz wrote to 'Adi ibn 'Adi, "Belief includes obligations
(<I>fara'id</I>), laws, legal limits of forbidden things (<I>hudud</I>),
and things preferred to do (<I>sunan</I>). Whoever fulfills all of them has
perfected his belief, and whoever does not fulfill them has not perfected
his belief. If I live, I will make them clear to you so that you can act
on them. If I die, however, I am not eager for your company."
<P>
Ibrahim (the Prophet) said,<I> "But so that my heart may be at peace."</I>
(2:260)
<P>
Mu'adh said, "Let us sit for a time [to renew and increase our] belief."
<P>
Ibn Mas'ud said, "Certainty is complete belief."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "A slave cannot attain to the reality of <I>taqwa</I> until
he removes all intrigue from his breast."
<P>
Mujahid said , <I>"'Allah has laid down the deen for you' </I>(42:13) means:
'O Muhammad! We commanded you to the same <I>deen</I> as We commanded him
(Nuh).'" Ibn 'Abbas said explaining the words of Allah,<I> "shir'atan wa
minjahan" </I>(5:48) "<I>Shir'a</I> means <I>sunan</I>, the way and method,
and <I>sabil</I> means path."
<P>
"Your call" means "your belief" in the words of Allah,<I> "Say: 'What has
My Lord to do with you if you do not call on Him?'"</I> (25:77)
<P>
8. It is related from Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,* said, "Islam
is based on five: the testifying (<I>shahada</I>) that there is no god except
Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing the prayer
(<I>salat</I>); paying the <I>zakat</I> (wealth-tax), the <I>Hajj</I> and
the fast (<I>sawm</I>) of Ramadan.
<P>
<P>
<B>II. On matters concerning belief</B>
<P>
And the words of Allah<I>, "It is not devoutness to turn your faces to the
East or to the West. , those with true devotion are those who believe in
Allah and the Last Day, the Angels, the Book and the Prophets, and who, despite
their love for it, give away their wealth to their relatives and to orphans
and the very poor, and to travellers and beggars and to set slaves free,
and who establish the prayer and pay zakat; those who honour their contracts
when they make them, and are steadfast in poverty and in illness and in battle.
Those are the people who are true. They are the godfearing.."</I> (2:177)
and the words of Allah, <I>"The believers are successful.."</I> (23:1)
<P>
9. It was related from Abu Hurayra, may Allah be pleased with him, that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Belief has over
sixty branches. Modesty is a branch of belief."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: On the Muslim being the one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims
are safe.</B>
<P>
10. It was related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, may Allah be pleased with him,
that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A Muslim
is the one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe. An emigrant
(<I>muhajir</I>) is someone who abandons what Allah has forbidden."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: On whose Islam is best.</B>
<P>
11. Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "They said, 'Messenger
of Allah, whose Islam is best?' He said, 'The one from whose tongue and hands
the Muslims are safe.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>V: On feeding people being part of Islam</B>
<P>
12. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "A man asked
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Which aspect of Islam
is best?' He said, 'Feeding people and greeting those you know and those
you do not know.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: On part of Islam being to want for one's brother what one wants for
oneself.</B>
<P>
13. It was related from Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you can truly be
said to believe until he wants for his brother what he wants for himself."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: On love for the Messenger being part of belief</B>
<P>
14. It was related from Abu Hurayra, may Allah be pleased with him, that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "By the One who
has my life in His hand, none of you will believe until he loves me more
than his father and his children."
<P>
15. It was related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "None of you will believe until he loves me more than his
father, his children and all people."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: On the sweetness of belief</B>
<P>
16. It was related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Whoever possesses three attributes will experience the
sweetness of belief: that he loves Allah and His Messenger more than anything
else; that he loves someone for the sake of Allah alone; and he hates reverting
to disbelief as much as he would hate being thrown into a fire."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: On love for the Ansar being a sign of belief</B>
<P>
17. It was related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Love for the Ansar is a sign of belief and hatred of the
Ansar is a sign of hypocrisy."
<P>
18. 'Ubada ibn as-Samit, may Allah be pleased with him, who was at the Battle
of Badr and was one of the leaders on the Night of 'Aqaba, said that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had a group
of his Companions around him and said, "Give homage to me based on not
associating anything with Allah, not stealing, not committing adultery, not
killing your children, not making a false accusation of adultery which you
forge yourselves and not being disobedient regarding anything good. Any among
you who fulfill this will be rewarded by Allah. Any who fall short regarding
any of these things and are punished in this world, that will be an expiation
for them. Whoever falls short regarding any of these things and Allah conceals
it, then it will be up to Allah. If He wishes, He will pardon him, and if
He wishes, He will punish him." 'Ubada said, "We gave him our allegiance
on those conditions."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: On fleeing from civil strife (fitan) being part of belief.</B>
<P>
19. It was related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The time will soon come when
the best property of a Muslim will be some sheep which he takes to the peaks
of the mountains and to places where the rain falls, in order to flee out
of the fear that his deen will be tempted."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: On the words of the Prophet, "I am the one of you with the most knowledge
of Allah."</B>
<P>
True knowledge is an action of the heart. Allah says,<I> "He will take you
to task for the intention your hearts have made." </I>(2:225)
<P>
20. 'A'isha said that whenever the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, gave people a command, he commanded them to perform
actions according to what they were able to do. They said, "Messenger of
Allah! We are not like you. Allah has forgiven you your past and future wrong
actions." [They wanted to do more difficult deeds.] He became angry so that
anger could be seen in his face. Then he said, "I am the one among you who
is the most godfearing and has the most knowledge of Allah!"
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: On part of belief being hating to revert to disbelief as much as
being thrown into a fire.</B>
<P>
21. It was related from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace,"Whoever possesses three attributes will experience the sweetness
of belief: whoever loves Allah and His Messenger more than anything else;
whoever loves someone for the sake of Allah alone; and whoever hates reverting
to disbelief as much as he would hate being thrown into a fire."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: Grading of the superiority of the believers is based on their
deeds</B>
<P>
22. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him,
that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the
people of the Garden enter the Garden and the people of the Fire enter the
Fire, Allah Almighty will then say, 'Bring out anyone who has the weight
of a grain of mustard-seed of belief in his heart,' and they will be brought
out of it, having been blackened by it. Then they will be thrown into the
rain river or life (Malik has doubt about the exact word, this or that) and
they will grow like a grain beside the bank of a torrent. Don't you see that
it comes up yellow and twisted?"
<P>
Wuhayb said that 'Amr said "life" and said "mustard-seed of good."
<P>
23. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri was heard to say that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "While I was asleep, I dreamed
I saw some people who were shown to me and who were wearing shirts some of
which reached to their breasts and some of which were shorter than that.
'Umar ibn al-Khattab was shown to me wearing a shirt that was trailing on
the ground." They asked, "How do you interpret that, Messenger of Allah?"
He said, "The <I>deen</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: On modesty being part of belief</B>
<P>
24. 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, passed by one of the men of the Ansar who was warning
his brother about being too modest. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Leave him. Modesty is part of belief."
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: On Allah's words,<I> "If they turn in repentance and establish the
prayer and pay zakat, let them go on their way."</I> (9:5)</B>
<P>
25. Ibn 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "I have been commanded to fight people until they testify
that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
and establish the prayer and pay the <I>zakat</I>. If they do that, their
lives and property are protected from me except for the right of Islam, and
their reckoning is up to Allah."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: On saying that belief lies in actions since Allah says, <I>"That
is the Garden you will inherit for what you did."</I> (43:72)</B>
<P>
A number of the men of knowledge have said that the words of Allah<I>, "By
your Lord, We will question them all, every one of them, about what that
they did!"</I> (15:92) are about the words, "There is no god but Allah."
&nbsp;He says: <I>&nbsp;"It is for the like of this that all workers should
work!"</I> (37:61)
<P>
26. Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was asked, "What action is the best?" He replied, "Belief
in Allah and His Messenger." He was asked, "Then what?" He replied, "Jihad
in the way of Allah." He was asked, "And then what?" He replied, "An accepted
<I>hajj</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: On when Islam is not genuine, but is on account of submission or
out of fear of being killed, as in the words of Allah<I>, "The desert Arabs
say, 'We believe.' Say: 'You do not believe. Say rather, "We have become
Muslim."'"</I> (49:14) If Islam is genuine, it is based on His words<I>,
"The only deen with Allah is Islam."</I> (3:19)</B>
<P>
27. Sa'd [ibn Abi Waqqas], may Allah be pleased with him, said that once
he was sitting with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, was distributing things to a group of people. "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left out a man whom I admired. I
said, 'Messenger of Allah, what about that person? By Allah, I see him to
be a believer (mu'min).'
<P>
The Prophet said, 'Or just a Muslim?' I was silent for a while and then what
I knew about him became too much for me and I repeated what I had said. I
replied, 'What about that person? By Allah, I see him to be a believer.'
He said, 'Or just a Muslim?'
<P>
[I was silent for a while.] Then what I knew about him became too much for
me again and I repeated what I had said and the Messenger of Allah repeated
what he had said. Then he said, 'Sa'd, I give to one man [and leave out]
another I love more than him out of fear that Allah might throw him on his
face into the Fire.' "
<P>
Yunus, Salih, Ma'mar and Ibn Akhi az-Zuhri related it from az-Zuhri.
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: On greeting widely being part of Islam. </B>
<P>
'Ammar said, "Whoever possesses three characters has possessed all belief:
gives other people what is due to them, gives the greeting to everyone, and
spends [in the way of Allah] even when he is poor."
<P>
28. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said that a man asked the Messenger of Allah, "What
aspect of Islam is best?" He replied, "To feed people and to greet those
you know and those you do not know."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: On [women's] ingratitude to their husbands, and ingratitude after
ingratitude. </B>
<P>
Something related by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri deals with in this subject.
<P>
29. Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'I was shown the Fire and most of its inhabitants were women
who were practising <I>kufr</I> (disbelief/ingratitude).' He was asked, 'Did
they practise disbelief (<I>kufr</I>) in Allah?' He replied, 'They were
ungrateful to their husbands and ungrateful for charity received. Even if
you were always to be good to one of them and then she saw something (else)
from you, she would say, "I have never had anything good from you at all!"
' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: On acts of disobedience being part of the <I>Jahiliyya</I></B>
<P>
However, someone disobeys Allah does not become an unbeliever unless he
associates others with Allah since the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said [to Abu Dharr] "You are a man who still has some of the
<I>Jahiliyya</I> in him," and Allah Almighty says<I>, "Allah does not forgive
partners being attributed to Him but He forgives whoever He wills for anything
apart from that."</I> (4:48)
<P>
30. Al-Ma'rur said, "I met Abu Dharr at ar-Rabadha. He was wearing a cloak
and his slave had a cloak on too. I asked him about this and he said, 'I
was exchanging insults with a man and abused him by insulting his mother.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to
me, "Abu Dharr! You abused him by insulting his mother! You are a man who
still has some of the <I>Jahiliyya</I> in you. Your slaves are your brothers
whom Allah has placed under your authority. Anyone who has authority over
his brother should feed him from what he eats and clothe him from what he
wears and you should not oblige his brothers to do what is too much for them.
If you ask that of them, then give them a hand."'"
<P>
[ar-Rabadha: a place close to Madina]
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI:<I> "If two parties of the believers fight, make peace between
them."</I> (49:9) Allah calls them "believers".</B>
<P>
31. Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays said, "As I was on my way to give my support to this
man (i.e. 'Ali), I met Abu Bakra and he said, 'Where are you going?' He said,
'To give my support to this man.' He said, 'Go back, for I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "When two Muslims
fight each other with their swords, then both the killer and killed are in
the Fire." I said to him, "Messenger of Allah, I can understand this with
regard to the killer, but what about the murdered man?" He replied, "He wanted
to kill his companion."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: On one injustice being able to be less than another injustice.</B>
<P>
32. 'Abdullah said, "When the words of Allah were revealed, <I>'Those who
believe and do not mix their belief with any wrongdoing,'</I> (6:82) the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
asked, 'Who among us has not done wrong?' Then Allah revealed, <I>'Attributing
partners to Him (shirk) is a terrible wrong.'" </I>(31:13)
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: On the signs of the hypocrite</B>
<P>
33. Abu Hurayra related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, "There are three signs of a hypocrite: whenever he speaks, he
lies; whenever he makes a promise, he breaks it; and whenever he is trusted,
he betrays his trust."
<P>
34. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone has four characteristics, he is
[like] a pure hypocrite, and if anyone has one of them, he has an aspect
of hypocrisy until he gives it up: whenever he is trusted, he betrays his
trust; whenever he speaks, he lies; when he makes an agreement, he breaks
it; and when he quarrels, he deviates from the truth speaks falsely.
<P>
Shu'ba corroborated with him in relating from al-A'mash.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: On performing the prayer on the Night of Power being part of
belief</B>
<P>
35. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who performs prayer on the Night
of Power motivated by belief and in anticipation of being rewarded will be
forgiven his past wrong actions."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: On Jihad being part of belief</B>
<P>
36. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Allah turns to the one who goes forth in His
way, and [Allah says] 'I will repay the one who only goes forth because of
his belief in Me and affirmation of My Messengers either with a reward or
booty or by admitting him into the Garden.'" [The Prophet said,] "If it were
not that it would be difficult for my community, I would not stay behind
on any expedition. I would love to be slain in the way of Allah and then
brought to life and then slain again and then brought to life and then slain
again ."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: On voluntary prayers in Ramadan being part of belief</B>
<P>
37. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever prays in Ramadan motivated
by belief and in expectation of the reward will be forgiven his past wrong
actions."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: On fasting Ramadan in expectation of reward being part of belief</B>
<P>
38. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever fasts in Ramadan motivated
by belief and in anticipation of the reward will be forgiven his past wrong
actions."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: On the deen (religion) being ease</B>
<P>
And the words of the Prophet, "The <I>deen</I> which Allah loves the most
is the tolerant Hanifiyya [natural unitary belief and correct behaviour]
one."
<P>
39. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The <I>deen</I> is easy. Whoever makes
the <I>deen</I> too hard for himself will be overpowered, so direct yourselves
to what is right, follow a middle course, accept the good news of the reward
for right action, and seek help [to reach your goal by being constant in
worshipping] in the morning, evening and some of the night."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: On prayer being part of belief</B>
<P>
And the words of Allah,<I> "Allah would not let your belief go to waste,"</I>
(2:143) meaning your prayer at the House [which had been offered in the past
towards the Masjid al-Aqsa]
<P>
40. Al-Bara' related that when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, came to Madina, he first stayed with the family of his grandfather
or maternal uncle who was from the Ansar. He prayed facing Jerusalem for
sixteen or seventeen months, all the time wishing that his <I>qibla</I> was
the House. The first prayer he prayed towards the Ka'ba was the <I>'Asr
</I>prayer in congregation. Then one of the men who had prayed with him left
and passed by some people in a mosque who were bowing in<I> ruku'</I>. He
said, "I testify by Allah that I prayed with the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, facing Makka." They immediately turned
towards the House. The Jews and the People of the Book had been pleased because
the Prophet was praying towards Jerusalem. When he turned towards the House,
they disliked that.
<P>
Al-Bara' said that some men had died or been slain before the <I>qibla</I>
was changed and we did not know what to say about them. Then Allah revealed,
<I>"Allah would not let your belief go to waste." </I>(2:143)
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: On the excellence of a man's Islam</B>
<P>
41. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that he heard the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "When someone becomes Muslim and
his Islam is sound, Allah wipes out all his previous evil deeds. After that
the accounting is that every good deed gets ten to seven hundred like it,
while every evil deed gets its equivalent unless Allah forgives it."
<P>
42. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the Islam of any of you is sound,
then each good deed he does has ten to seven hundred times the reward is
written for him and every evil deed has its equivalent written for him."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXI: On the <I>deen</I> which Allah loves best being that which is most
constant.</B>
<P>
43. It is related from 'A'isha that once the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came when a woman was with her. He asked, "Who is this?"
She replied, "So-and-so," and told him about the amount she prayed. He said,
"Stop! You must only do what you are able. By Allah, Allah does not grow
weary [of giving rewards] as you grow weary, and the deen He likes best is
the one in which there is constancy."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXII: On belief increasing and decreasing</B>
<P>
And the words of Allah, <I>"We increased them in guidance," </I>(18:13)<I>
"So that those who believe might increase in their belief,"</I> (74:31) and
<I>"Today I have perfected your deen for you."</I> (5:3) When something is
left out of something which is perfect, then it becomes imperfect.
<P>
44. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' and has a
barley-corn's weight of good in his heart will come out of the Fire. Whoever
says 'There is no god but Allah' and has a wheat-grain's weight of good in
his heart will come out of the Fire. Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah'
and has a atom's weight of good in his heart will come out of the Fire."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said <I>iman</I> (belief) instead of <I>khayr</I> (good).
<P>
45. Once a Jewish man said to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, "Amir al-Mu'minin! There
is an <I>ayat</I> you recite in your book which, had it been sent down to
us Jews, we would have appointed that day a festival." He asked, "What is
this <I>ayat</I>?" The Jew replied<I>, "Today I have perfected your deen
for you and completed My blessing upon you and am pleased with Islam as a
deen for you."</I> (5:3) 'Umar said, "We know the time and place it was revealed
to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He was standing
at 'Arafa on a Friday."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIII: On zakat being part of Islam</B>
<P>
And the words of Allah, <I>"They were only ordered to worship Allah, making
their deen sincerely His as people of pure natural belief, and to establish
the prayer and pay zakat &#150; that is the correct deen." </I>(98:5)
<P>
46. Talha ibn 'Ubaydullah said that a man came to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from the people of Najd. His hair
was unkempt. The sound of his voice could be heard, but they could not understand
what he said until he drew near. He was asking about Islam. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "It is five prayers
a day." He asked, "Do I have to do any more?" He said, "No, unless you want
to do voluntary prayers."
<P>
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then said,
"And you must fast the month of Ramadan."
<P>
He asked, "Do I have to do any more?"
<P>
He said, "No, unless you want to do so voluntarily." Then the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned zakat to him. He
said, "Do I have to do any more?" He said, "No, unless you want to do so
voluntarily." The man withdrew, saying, "By Allah, I will not do more than
this nor less than this." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "If he speaks the truth, he will have success." [i.e.
he will be granted Paradise]
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIV: On following funerals being part of belief</B>
<P>
47. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who follows the funeral procession
of a Muslim motivated by belief and in expectation of the reward and stays
with it until the prayer has been said over him and his burial is over, comes
back with the reward of two qirats. Each qirat is the size of Uhud. And whoever
prays over him and leaves before he is buried, comes back with one qirat."
<P>
'Uthman corroborated with him.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXV: On the believer's fear that his actions will come to nothing without
his being aware of it.</B>
<P>
Ibrahim at-Taymi said, "When I compare my words with my actions, I fear that
I may be called a liar." Ibn Abi Mulayka said, "I met thirty Companions of
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,, and all of them were
afraid of becoming hypocrites. None of them said that he had the belief of
Jibril or Mika'il." Al-Hasan al-Basri said, "Only a believer is afraid and
only a hypocrite feels secure." One should be wary about persisting in hypocrisy
and rebellion without repenting to Allah as Allah says, <I>"They do not knowingly
persist in what they were doing."</I> (3:135)
<P>
48. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Insulting a Muslim is going off the path (fusuq)
and killing him is disbelief."
<P>
49. Anas said that 'Ubada ibn as-Samit informed him that once the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to tell people
about the Night of Power (<I>Laylatu'l-Qadr</I>). There were two Muslim men
quarrelling with one another. He said, "I came out to tell you about the
Night of Power and these two here were quarrelling, and thus its knowledge
was taken away. It may be that it is better for you. Seek for it on the
twenty-seventh, twenty-ninth and twenty-fifth of the month."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVI: On Jibril asking the Prophet, Messenger of Allah about belief,
Islam and Ihsan and the knowledge of the Hour and the explanation which the
Prophet gave him. </B>
<P>
Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying, "Jibril
came to teach you your religion (<I>deen</I>)." So he called all of that
<I>deen</I>. And what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
explained to the delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays about belief and the words of
Allah, <I>"If anyone desires anything other than Islam as a deen, it will
not be accepted from him." </I>(3:85)
<P>
50. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went out one day to the people and Jibril came to him
and asked, "What is belief?" He said, "Belief is that you believe in Allah
and His angels, in the meeting with Him, and in His Messengers and that you
believe in the Resurrection." Then he asked, "What is Islam?" He replied,
"Islam is that you worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him,
perform the prayer [perfectly], pay the obligatory poor-tax, and fast Ramadan."
He asked, "What is Ihsan?" He said, "To worship Allah as if you were seeing
Him. For even if you do not see Him, [be aware that] He sees you." He asked,
"When is the Last Hour?" He answered, "The one who is asked does not know
more than the asker, but I will tell you its signs: when the slave-girl gives
birth to her master and when the herdsmen of black camels begin to rival
one another erecting in tall buildings. And there are five things which only
Allah knows." Then the Prophet recited, <I>"Truly Allah has knowledge of
the Hour..." </I>(31:34) Then the man turned away. The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Call him back," but they could not
see him anywhere. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"That was Jibril who came to teach people their deen." Abu 'Abdullah said,
"He considered all of these things part of belief."
<P>
51. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas that Abu Sufyan had informed
him that Heraclius had said to him, "I asked you whether they were on the
increase or decrease and you claimed that they were on the increase. That
is what happens with belief until it is complete. I asked you whether anyone
had apostatized out of dislike for his <I>deen</I> after he had entered and
you claimed that they had not. That is how it is with belief when its joy
mixes with the hearts. No one ever dislikes it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: On the excellence of the one who exercises prudence in his religion
(deen).</B>
<P>
52. An-Nu'man ibn Bashir was heard to say that he heard the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "The <I>halal</I> is
clear and the <I>haram</I> is clear. But there are doubtful things between
the two about which most people have no knowledge. Whoever shows caution
with regard to what is doubtful, exercises prudence in respect of his deen
and his honour. Whoever gets involved in the doubtful things is like a herdsman
who grazes his animals near a private preserve (<I>hima</I>). He is bound
to enter it. Every king has a private preserve and the private preserve of
Allah on His earth are the things that He has made forbidden. There is piece
of flesh in the body, the nature of which is that when it is sound, the entire
body is sound, and when it is corrupt, the entire body is corrupt - it is
the heart."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVIII: On paying the <I>khums</I> being part of belief</B>
<P>
53. Abu Jamra said, "I used to sit with Ibn 'Abbas and he made me sit on
his bed. He said, 'Stay with me so that I can give you some of what I have.'
I stayed with him for two months, and part of what he said was that when
the delegation of the tribe of 'Abdu'l-Qays came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, he asked them, 'Who (or what delegation) are
you?' They replied, 'Rabi'a.' He said, 'Welcome to the people (or delegation).
May you not suffer disgrace nor regret!' They said, 'Messenger of Allah!
We can only come to you in the sacred months since there is a district of
the unbelievers of Mudar between us and you. Give us some clear instructions
which we can convey to those we left behind and by which we may enter Paradise.'
They asked him about drinks. The Prophet commanded them to do four things
and forbade them to do four things. He commanded them to believe in Allah
alone and asked them, 'Do you know what belief in Allah alone is?' They said,
'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, "To testify that there is no
god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish the
prayers, to pay the <I>zakat</I>, to fast Ramadan and to pay the <I>khums</I>
(fifth).' He forbade them four things: <I>hantam, dubba', naqir </I>and
<I>muzaffat</I> or <I>muqayyar</I>. [different kinds of wine vessels] He
said, 'Remember these and convey them to the people you left behind.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: On what has come about "Actions are by intentions" and "sincere
expectation of reward," and "every man has what he intends." </B>
<P>
This includes belief, <I>wudu'</I>, the prayer, <I>zakat</I>, <I>hajj</I>,
fasting and ordinances. Allah's words, <I>"Each man acts according to his
nature"</I> (17:84) , means "according to his intention". A man's spending
on his family for which he hopes to be rewarded [by Allah] is sadaqa. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ["There is no emigration
after the Conquest [of Makka], but jihad and the intention."
<P>
54. It is related from 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him,
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"Actions are but judged according to intentions. Every man has what he intends.
Whoever emigrates to Allah and His Messenger, his emigration is to Allah
and His Messenger. So whoever emigrates to gain something of this world or
to marry a woman, his emigration is for that to which he emigrated."
<P>
55. It is related from Abu Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "When a man spends on his family and sincerely hopes
to be rewarded for it, it is sadaqa." 
<P>
56. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "You will be rewarded for whatever you spend
on your family desiring by it for the sake of of Allah, even for the morsel
you put in your wife's mouth."
<P>
<P>
<B>XL. On the words of the Prophet, "The <I>deen </I>is sincere counsel for
Allah, His Messenger, the Imams of the Muslims and the common Muslims, and
Allah's words, "provided they are true to Allah and His Messenger ." (9:91)</B>
<P>
<B> </B>57. 'Abdullah ibn Jarir said, "I offered allegiance to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the condition that
I would perform the prayer, pay the zakat and offer sincere counsel to every
Muslim."
<P>
58. Jarir ibn 'Abdullah was heard speaking on the day when al-Mughira ibn
Shu'ba died. He stood up, praised and glorified Allah, and said, "You must
have fearful awareness of Allah alone who has no partner. You must demonstrate
self-possession and tranquillity until a new amir arrives and he will arrive
soon. Ask the forgiveness of Allah for your [previous] amir, for he used
to love to pardon." Then he said, "I went to the Prophet and said, 'I give
you my allegiance in Islam,' and he said I had to give sincere counsel to
every Muslim, and I gave him my allegiance with that undertaking. By the
Lord of this mosque, I have advised you sincerely." Then he asked for Allah's
forgiveness and stepped down.
