<B>I: The obligation of the <I>khumus</I></B>
<P>
2925. It is related that 'Ali said, "I received an old she-camel in my share
of the booty of the Battle of Badr and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, had also given me an old she-camel from the <I>khumus</I>.
When I wanted to marry Fatima, peace be upon her, the daughter of the Messenger
of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, I arranged with a goldsmith
of the Banu Qaynuqa' to travel with me. We brought some <I>idhkhir</I>
&nbsp;herb which I intended to sell to the goldsmiths and use the proceeds
for my wedding feast. While I was collecting gear for my camels in saddles,
sacks and ropes, my camels were kneeling beside the room of a man of the
Ansar. I returned when I had gathered what I gathered and there were my two
camels with their humps cut off and their sides split open and some of their
livers taken. I could not control my tears when I saw them in that state
and I asked, 'Who has done this?' They replied, 'Hamza ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib
did it. He is in this room with some of the Ansar who are drinking.'
<P>
"I went until I came in to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace. Zayd ibn Haritha was with him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, recognised my distress in my face and the Prophet. may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'What is wrong with you?' I answered,
'Messenger of Allah, I have never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked
my two camels and cut off their humps and slit open their sides. He is in
a house with some drinkers.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, called for his cloak and put it on and then went walking, and I and
Zayd ibn Haritha followed him until he reached the house where Hamza was.
He asked for permission to enter and they gave him permission. They were
drunk. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began
to rebuke Hamza for what he had done. Hamza was intoxicated and his eyes
were red. Hamza looked at the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and then he raised his eyes and looked at his knees, and
then he raised his eyes and looked at his navel and then he raised his eyes
and looked at his face. Then Hamza asked, 'Are you not my father's slaves?'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw that
he was drunk, and so the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, withdrew and we went out with him.'"
<P>
2926. It is related that 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin, reported that Fatima,
peace be upon her, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, asked Abu Bakr as-Siddiq after the death of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to allot her
her share of the inheritance from what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, left of the spoils which Allah had given him.
Abu Bakr said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'We do not bequeath inheritance. What we leave is <I>sadaqa</I>.'" Fatima,
the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, got angry and disassociated herself
from Abu Bakr. She remained disassociated from him until she died. She lived
for six months after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace."
<P>
She said, "Fatima used to ask Abu Bakr for her share of what the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left of Khaybar and Fadak
and his <I>sadaqa</I> in Madina. Abu Bakr refused to give her that and said,
'I will not abandon anything that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to do. I follow that. I fear that if I were
to abandon some of his business, I would swerve. ' As for the <I>sadaqa</I>
in Madina. 'Umar gave it to 'Ali and 'Abbas, and as for Khaybar and Fadak,
'Umar kept them and said, 'These two are the <I>sadaqa</I> of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which were for the rights
and events which arose. Their business passes to the one in authority."
<P>
Az-Zuhri observed, "They are still like that today."
<P>
2927. It is is related that Malik ibn Aws said, "I was sitting with my family
when the sun was up and the day was very hot when the messenger of 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab came to me and said, 'Respond to the Amir al-Mu'minin!' I
went with him and entered where 'Umar was. He was sitting on a bed of palm-leaves
and there was no mattress between him and it. He was leaning on a leather
cushion. I greeted him and then sat down. He said, 'O Malik! some of your
people with families came to me and I have ordered a gift for them. Take
it and distribute it among them.' I said, 'Amir al-Mu'minin! I wish that
you would command someone else to do it.' He said, 'Take it, O man!'
<P>
"While I was sitting there with him, his chamberlain Yarfa' came and asked,
'Will you admit 'Uthman, 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf, az-Zubayr, and Sa'd ibn
al-Waqqas who are asking permission to enter?' He said, 'Yes.' He gave them
permission and they entered and greeted him and sat down. Then Yarfa' sat
for a short time and then he said, 'Will you admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?' He said,
'Yes.' He gave them permission and they entered and greeted and sat down.
'Abbas said, 'Amir al-Mu'minin! Judge between me and this one!' They had
a disagreement about the spoils which Allah had given His Messenger from
the Banu'n-Nadir. The group, 'Uthman and his companions, said, 'O Amir
al-Mu'minin! Judge between them and give them relief from one another.' 'Umar
said, 'Be patient. I adjure you by Allah by whose permission the heaven and
earth subsist, do you know that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "We do not bequeath inheritance. What we leave
is <I>sadaqa</I>," and that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, meant himself?' The group agreed, 'He said that.' 'Umar
turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, 'I adjure you by Allah, did the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say that?' They replied,
'He said that.' 'Umar said, 'I will talk to you about this matter. Allah
singled out His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for these
spoils with something which he did not give anyone else. Then he recited<I>,
"Whatever booty from them Allah has given to His Messenger &#150; and you
spurred on neither horse nor camel in its acquisition, but Allah gives power
to His Messengers over anyone He wills, Allah has power over all things."</I>
(59:6) He said, "That was specially for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. By Allah, he did not appropriate it to your
exclusion, and he did not prefer himself with it against you. He gave it
to you and distributed it among you until this property remained of it. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to spend
on his family the maintenance of a year from this property. Then what remained
he made the property of Allah. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, did that during his lifetime. I adjure by Allah, do
you know that?' They answered, 'Yes.' Then he said to 'Ali and 'Abbas, 'I
adjure you by Allah, do you know that?'
<P>
"'Umar continued, 'Then Allah took His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and Abu Bakr said, "I am the successor of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.' So Abu Bakr took it and acted with it as
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had acted.
Allah knows best that in it he was truthful, good, rightly-guided, following
the truth. Then Allah took Abu Bakr and I am the successor of Abu Bakr. I
help it under my control for two years during which I acted in it as the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had acted and
as Abu Bakr had acted. Allah knows best that I was truthful, good, right-guided,
following the truth in it. Then you two came to talk to me, and you both
said the same thing and presented the same case. 'Abbas, you came to me to
ask me for your share from your nephew, and this one - meaning 'Ali - came
to me to seek his wife's share from her father. I said to you two that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "We do
not bequeath inheritance. What we leave is <I>sadaqa</I>," Then I thought
it best to hand it over to you and I said, "If you wish, I will hand it over
to you on the basis that you take the pledge and pact of Allah to act in
it as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, acted
in it and as Abu Bakr acted in it and as I acted in it since I took charge,"
and you both said, "Hand it over to us," and I handed it over to you on that
basis. I adjure you by Allah, did I give it to them on that basis?' The group
said, 'Yes.' Then he turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, 'I adjure you by
Allah, did I give it to you on that basis?' They answered, 'Yes.' He said,
'So are you now seeking from me a decision other than that? By Allah by whose
permission the heaven and earth susbsist, I would not give a decision in
it other than that! If you are incapable of it, then give it to me and I
will spare you of it.'"
<P>
<P>

Banu'l-Qays and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, We are from the tribe of Rabi'a.
The unbelievers of Mudar are situated between us and you. We can only come
to you in the sacred month Give us some instructions to which we can summon
those we left behind, He said, 'I command you to do four things and forbade
you to do four things: to believe in Allah, to testify that there is no god
but Allah,' and he pointed with his hand, 'to establish the prayers, to pay
the <I>zakat</I>, to fast Ramadan and to pay the <I>khums</I> (fifth) to
Allah from the booty you take. I forbide you:<I> dubba',</I> <I>naqir</I>,
<I>hantam</I>, and<I> muzaffat</I>.'"

<P>
2930. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah

men of the Ansar passed by and greeted the Prophet, may Allah bless him and

anything from me which you order me to do ?" He said to him, "No." He said
to him, "Will you give me the sword of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace? I am afraid that the people will take it from
you by force. By Allah, if you give it to me, it will never be taken from
me until I breathe my last!"
<P>
['Ali said,] "When 'Ali ibn Abi Talib proposed to the daughter of Abu Jahl
while he was married to Fatima, peace be upon her, I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, addressing the people
about that on this minbar of his and on that day I had reached puberty. He
said, 'Fatima is from me and I fear that she will be tested in her
<I>deen</I>.' Then he mentioned an in-law of his from the Banu 'Abdu Shams
and praised him as an in-law, and said, 'He spoke to me and told the truth.
He promised me and kept his promise. I do not make the lawful unlawful and
I do not make the unlawful lawful but, by Allah, the daughter of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the daughter of the
enemy of Allah will not be joined together.'"
<P>
[The in-law was Abu'l-'As, the husband of Zaynab.]
<P>
2944. It is related that [Muhammad] ibn al-Hanafiyya said, "If 'Ali had mentioned
anything not good about 'Uthman, he would have mentioned him regarding the
day when some people came to him and complained about the <I>zakat</I> collectors
of 'Uthman. 'Ali said to me, 'Go to 'Uthman and tell him: this [document]
contains [the rules of] the <I>zakat</I> of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, so command your agents to act according to
it.' I brought it to him and he stated, 'I have no need it.' I took it to
'Ali and informed him and he said, 'Put it back where you took it from.'"
<P>
It is related from Ibn al-Hanafiyya who said, "My father sent me: 'Take this
letter and take it to 'Uthman. It contains the command of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, regarding <I>zakat</I>.'"
<P>
[The hadith actually has <I>sadaqa</I> rather than <I>zakat</I>, as the terms
were used interchangeably at that time.

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the poor. The preference
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the People of
the Suffa and widows. When Fatima complained to him about grinding and milling
and asked him to give her a servant from the captives, he told her to trust
in Allah</B>
<P>
2945. It is related from 'Ali, "Fatima, peace be upon her, complained of
what she endured from the mill for grinding, and she heard that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had taken captives. She
went to him to ask for a servant and she did not find him. She mentioned
it to 'A'isha. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
came, 'A'isha mentioned that to him. He came to him when we had gone to bed
and we went to get up and he said, 'Stay where you are' until I felt the
coolness of his feet on my chest. He said, 'Shall I indicate to you two what
is better than what you asked for? When you go to bed, say "Allah is greater"
thirty-four times, "Praise be to Allah" thirty-three times, and "Glory be
to Allah" thirty-three times. That is better for you than what you asked
for.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"A fifth of it belongs is to Allah
and to the Messenger," </I>(8:41), </B>

bless him and grant him peace, said, "I am the distributor and the treasurer,
and it Allah who gives."
<P>
2946. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "A man of us among the
Ansar had a boy born to him, and he wanted to name him Muhammad." Shu'ba
said in the <I>hadith</I> of Mansur, "The Ansari said, 'I put him on my shoulder
and took him to the Prophet*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,."
In the <I>hadith</I> of Sulayman, "A boy was born to him and he wanted to
name him Muhammad. He said, 'Name yourselves with my name but do not use
my <I>kunya</I>. I have been made a distributor to divide things between
you.'" Husayn said, "I was sent as a distributor to divide between you."
Jabir said, "He meant that he wanted to call him al-Qasim and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Name yourselves with my name
but do not use my <I>kunya</I>.'"
<P>
2947. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari said, "A man among
us had a boy born to him and he named him al-Qasim. The Ansar said, 'We will
not give you the <I>kunya</I> of Abu'l-Qasim and we will not delight you
with that.' He went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and said, 'Messenger of Allah, a boy was born to me and I called him al-Qasim.
The Ansar said to me, "We will not give you the <I>kunya</I> of Abu'l-Qasim
and we will not delight you with that."' The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, ''Name yourselves with my name but do not use
my <I>kunya</I>. I am Qasim.'"
<P>
2948. It is related that Mu'awiya was heard to say that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When Allah desires
good for someone, He gives him correct understanding in the <I>deen</I>.
Allah gives, and I am a distributor. This community will continue to defeat
those who oppose them until the command of Allah comes, and they will be
victorious."
<P>
2949. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "I do not give to you nor deny you.
I am a distributor who puts it where I am commanded."

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Men who spend out the property
of Allah without due right will go to the Fire on the Day of Rising."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"Booty has been made lawful for you."</B>
<P>

take." </I>(48:20) It was general until the Messenger, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace,clarified it.
<P>
2951. It is related from 'Urwa al-Bariqi that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Good will remain tied to the forelocks of
horses until the Day of Rising."
<P>
2952. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Then Chosroes will be destroyed and
there will be no Chosroes after him. Then Caesar will be destroyed and there
will be no Caesar after him. By the One in whose hand my soul is, you will
spend their treasures in the way of Allah."
<P>
2953. It is related that Jabir ibn Samura said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Then Chosroes will be destroyed
and there will be no Chosroes after him. Then Caesar will be destroyed and
there will be no Caesar after him. By the One in whose hand my soul is, you
will spend their treasures in the way of Allah."
<P>

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Booty has been made lawful
to me."
<P>

bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah has guaranteed that one who does
<I>jihad</I> in His way and only goes forth for <I>jihad</I> in His Way with
belief in His words will enter the Garden or return to his home from which
he set out with what he obtained of reward or booty."
<P>
2956. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "One of the Prophets, may the blessings
and peace of Allah be upon them, went on an expedition and said to his people,
'A man who has contracted a marriage with a woman and wants to consummate
it but has not yet done so should not go with me, nor should anyone who has
built a house and not yet raised its roof, nor anyone who has bought some
sheep or pregnant she-camels and is waiting for them to give birth.' So he
went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the <I>'Asr
</I>prayer, or about that time. He said to the sun, 'You are under command
and I am under command. O Allah, hold it back for us!' And it was held back
until Allah gave him victory. He gathered the booty and it, i.e. the fire,
came to consume it, but it did not consume it. He said, 'Some of you have
stolen from the booty. A man from every tribe should come and give allegiance.'
One man's hand stuck to his hand and he said, 'The theft is among you. Your
tribe should give me allegiance.' The hands of two or three men stuck to
his hand, and he said, 'The theft is among you.' So they brought a head made
of gold looking like the head of a cow and put it down and the fire came
and consumed it. Booty was not lawful for anyone before us. Then Allah made
booty lawful for us. Allah saw our weakness and incapacity and so He made
it lawful for us."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Booty is for those who are present at the battle</B>
<P>
2957. It is related that 'Umar said, "If it were not for future Muslims,
I would have distributed every village I conquered among its people as the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, distributed Khaybar."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Does the one who fights for the sake of booty have his reward
decreased?</B>
<P>
2958. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "A desert Arab said to
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'One man fights for
booty, and one man fights for renown, and another fights so that his position
will be seen. Who is truly in the way of Allah?' He said, 'The one who fights
so that the word of Allah will be the uppermost is fighting in the way of
Allah.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The ruler distributes what is before him and sets aside the share
of those who are not present or are absent</B>

Allah bless him and grant him peace, was given some silk cloaks with gold
buttons and to divided them between some of his Companions and he put aside
one for Makhrama ibn Nawfal. He came with his son, al-Miswar ibn Makhrama,
and stood at the door and said, 'Call him for me.' The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, heard his voice and took a cloak and gave
it to him, saying, 'I kept this for you. I kept this for you.'"
<P>
It is related from al-Miswar, "Some cloaks came to the Allah." Al-Layth
corroborated it from Ibn Abi Mulayka.
<P>

(the goods) of Quraza and an-Nadir, and what he took of that for his needs</B>
<P>
2960. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "A man would appoint
for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, some of his palm-trees
until he conquered Qurayza and an-Nadir. After that, he returned that to
them."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: The blessing in the property of the one who fought with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and those in authority</B>
<P>
2961. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr said, "When az-Zubayr stood
awaiting the Battle of the Camel, he called me over and I went to his side.
He said, 'O my son, no one will be killed today except someone wronging or
someone wronged. I think that I will be killed today as one of the wronged.
One of my greatest concerns is my debts. Do you think that any of our property
will remain after out debts are settled?' He said, 'O my son! Sell our property
and pay my debts!. Then he willed a third, and a third of it was for his
sons, i.e. the sons of 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr. He said, 'A third of the
third. If anything is left over of our property after paying the debts, then
a third of it is for your children.' (Hisham said, "Some of the sons of 'Abdullah
were the same age as the sons of az-Zubayr: Khubayb and 'Abbad. At that time
he had nine sons and nine daughters.")" 'Abdullah said, "My father began
to order me concerning his debts and say, 'O my son, if you are unable to
settle any of it, then ask my Master for help in doing it." He said, "By
Allah, I did not know what he meant so I said, 'O my father, who is your
Master?' He said, 'Allah.'" He said, "Whenever I ran into a difficulty regarding
his debt I said, 'O Master of az-Zubayr! Pay his debt for him!' and He would
settle it. Az-Zubayr was killed without leaving a single dinar or a dirham,
but only two pieces of land, one of which was al-Ghaba, and eleven houses
in Madina, two in Basra, one in Kufa, and one in Egypt." He said, "The debt
that he owed resulted from people bringing him money to leave in his keeping.
Az-Zubayr would say, 'No, let it rather be a loan, for otherwise I fear that
it might get lost.' He was never appointed to a government post of any kind
nor to the collection of land-tax (<I>kharaj</I>) nor anything else. What
he had came only from expeditions with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, or with Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman."
<P>
'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr said, "When I worked out the debt he owed, I found
it to be two million and two hundred thousand." Hakim ibn Hizam met 'Abdullah
ibn az-Zubayr and said, "Nephew, how large a debt does my brother have?"
I concealed it and said, "A hundred thousand." Hakim said, "By Allah, I do
not think that your property will cover this amount." 'Abdullah said, "What
would you think if it were two million and two hundred thousand?" He said,
"I do not think you will be able to pay this. If you are unable to cover
any of it, then ask me for help."
<P>
He said, "Az-Zubayr had purchased al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand,
and 'Abdullah sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he stood
up and said, 'Anyone who is owed anything by az-Zubayr should come to us
at al-Ghaba.' 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far came to him, and az-Zubayr owed him four
hundred thousand. He said to 'Abdullah. 'If you like, I will forgo it.' 'Abdullah
said, 'No.' He said, 'If you like, you can delay payment if you want to.'
'Abdullah said, 'No.'" He said, "He said, 'So allocate me a piece of land.'
'Abdullah said, 'You can have from here to there.' 'Abdullah sold some of
it and paid his debts in full and there remained four and a half shares of
the land. He went to Mu'awiya while 'Amr ibn 'Uthman, al-Mundhir ibn az-Zubayr
and Ibn Zam'a were with him. Mu'awiya said, 'How much have you valued al-Ghaba
at?' He said, 'Each share at a hundred thousand.' He said, 'How much remains?'
He said, 'Four and half shares.' Al-Mundhir ibn az-Zubayr said, 'I will take
a share for a hundred thousand.' 'Amr ibn 'Uthman said, 'I will take a share
for a hundred thousand.' Ibn Zam'a said, 'I will take a share for a hundred
thousad.' Mu'awiya said, 'How much remains?' He said, 'A share and a half.'
He said, 'I will take them for one hundred and fifty thousand.'"
<P>
He said, "'Abdullah ibn Ja'far later sold his share to Mu'awiya for sixty
thousand. When Ibn az-Zubayr finishing settling his debts, the sons of az-Zubayr
said, 'Distribute our inheritance between us.' He said, 'No, by Allah, I
will not distribute it until I have made this announcement for four years
during the hajj festival: 'Anyone who has a debt owed him by az-Zubayr should
come to us and we will settle it.'" He said, "He announced that every year
at the festival and when the four years were up, he distributed it between
them. Az-Zubayr had four wives and after the prescribed third was removed,
each wife got a million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of
his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: If the ruler sends a messenger on an errand or orders him to remain
at home, does he receive a share (of the booty)?</B>
<P>
2962. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "'Uthman was absent from Badr. He
was married to the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace. She was ill and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to him, 'You have the reward and share of someone who
was present at Badr.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: The evidence that the <I>khumus</I> is for the needs of the Muslims</B>
<P>
When the Hawazin made their request of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, by virtue of his suckling relationship to them, he asked
the Muslims to forgo their shares. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to promise the people that he would give them
some of the spoils and booty from the <I>khumus</I>. He also gave to the
Ansar and gave Jabir ibn 'Abdullah some of the dates of Khaybar.
<P>
2963. It is related from Marwan ibn al-Hakam and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama that
when the delegation of Hawazin came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, as Muslims, he stood up. They asked him to
restore to them their property and their people who had been captured. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, told them, 'The
words I love the most are those which are the most truthful. Choose one of
the two - either the captives or the property. I have delayed distributing
them.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
waited for them for about ten days after returning from Ta'if. When it was
apparent to them that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, would only return one of the two to them, they said, 'We will
take the captives.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, got up among the Muslims and praised Allah as He deserves and
then said, 'Following on from that: these brothers of yours have come in
repentance and I think that the captives should be returned to them. Any
of you who are happy with this should do that. Any of you who want to keep
their share until we can pay him from the first spoils which Allah brings
us may do that. The people said, 'We are happy to do that in their case for
the sake of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,.'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'We
do not know which of you have allowed it and which have not. Go back so that
your leaders can inform us of your decision.' The people went back and their
leaders spoke to them and then they returned to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace,* and told him, 'They are happy with
that and give their permission.' This is what reached us regarding the captives
of Hawazin."
<P>
2964. It is related that Zahdam said, "We were with Abu Musa who brought
a meal with chicken. There was present with him a man from the Banu Taym
who was reddish as if he were one of the Greek clients. He was invited to
the food but he said, 'I saw them eating something filthy and I swore that
I would not eat them.' Abu Musa said, 'Come and I will inform you about that,
I came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, among the
group of the Ash'arites, asking him to give us mounts. He said, 'By Allah,
I will not give you mounts, and I do not have any mounts to give you.' Then
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought
some camels as booty. He asked about us and said, 'Where are the Ash'arite
group?' He commanded for us five camels with white humps. When we leave,
we said, 'What have we done? There will be no blessings for us.' So we returned
to him and said, 'We asked you to give us mounts and you swore that you would
not give us mounts. Did you forget?' He said, 'I am not the one who gave
you mounts, but Allah gave you mounts. By Allah, if Allah wills, I will never
make an oath and then see something better than it without doing expiation
for my oath and doing the thing that is better.'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw16.html#15">2965</A>. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent out a party which
contained 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar towards Najd. They took a lot of camels as
booty. Their shares were twelve camels, or eleven, and they were each given
an extra camel.
<P>
2966. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to give extra to some of those in parties
whom he sent out for themselves in addition to the general share of the army.
<P>
2967. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The fact that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had departed reached us while we were in the
Yemen. So we set out to emigrate to him - me and two of my brothers, and
I was the youngest of them. One of them was Abu Burda and the other was Abu
Ruhm. (He said either, "We were some," or "We were fifty-three or fifty-two)
men of our people. We embarked on a boat and out boat took us to the Negus
in Abyssinia. We found Ja'far ibn Abi Talib with his companions. Ja'far said,
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has sent
us here and ordered us to stay, so stay with us.' So we stayed with him until
we all went and found the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
when he had conquered Khaybar. He gave us a share. (or he said, "He gave
us some of it.") He did not allot anything to anyone who was absent from
the conquest of Khaybar other than those who were present with him, except
for the people of our ship as well as Ja'far and his companions. He also
gave them a share."
<P>
2968. It is related that Jabir was heard to say, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If the money of Bahrayn comes,
I will give you such-and-such.' The money of Bahrayn did not come until after
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had died. When the
money of Bahrayn arrived, Abu Bakr commanded that it be announced, 'Whoever
has a promise with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
or a debt should come to us.' I came to him and said, 'The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, promised me such-and-such.' He gave me a double
handful three times."
<P>
Sufyan began to scoop with both his hands. Then he said to us, "That is how
Ibn al-Munkadir said it."
<P>
Once he said, "I went to Abu Bakr and asked for the money, but he did not
give to me. Then I came to him and he did not give to me. Then I came to
him a third time and I said, 'I asked you and you did not give to me, and
then I asked you and you did not give to me, and then I asked you and you
did not give to me. Either you give to me or you are miserly towards you.'
He said, 'You say you have experienced miserliness from me? Every time I
denied you, I wanted to give to you.'"
<P>
It is related from Jabir, "He scopped up a handful for me and said, 'Count
it.' I found it to be five hundred. He said, 'Take its like twice.'" Ibn
al-Munkadir remarked, "What ailment is more severe than miserliness?"
<P>
2969. It is said that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "While the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was distributing the booty at al-Ji'rana
when a man said to him, 'Be just.' He replied to him, 'I would be wretched
if I were not just.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI. CHAPTER: The favour shown by the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, to captives without taking the <I>khumus</I></B>
<P>
2970. It is related that Jubayr said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said about the captives of Badr, "If al-Mut'im ibn 'Adi
had been alive and spoke to me about these foul ones, I would have left them
for his sake."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: Part of the evidence for the fact that the <I>khumus</I> is for
the ruler and he can give to some of his relatives rather others is what
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, distributed of the
khumus of Khaybar to the Banu'l-Muttalib and Banu Hashim</B>
<P>
'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz said, "He did not make that general to all of them
and he did not single out one relative other than the one who was more in
need. He gave&nbsp;to those who complained to him of need and because of
what they suffered from their people and their allies for his sake."
<P>
2971. It is related that Jubayr ibn Mut'im said, "I and 'Uthman ibn 'Affan
went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and said, 'Messenger of Allah, you have given to the Banu'l-Muttalib and
left us out although we have the same position with you.' He replied, 'The
Banu'l-Muttalib and the Banu Hashim are the same.'"
<P>
Furthermore Jubayr said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, did not distribute a share to the Banu 'Abdu Shams nor the Banu Nawfal."
<P>
Ibn Ishaq said, "'Abdu Shams, Hashim and al-Muttalib are maternal brothers.
Their mother was 'Atika bint Murra. Nawfal was their paternal brother."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: The one who did not take the <I>khumus</I> from the spoils of a
slain enemy. The one who kills the enemy is entitled to&nbsp;his spoils without
any <I>khumus</I>, and the judgement of the ruler about it</B>
<P>
2972. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf said, "While I was standing
in the ranks on the Day of Badr, I looked to my right and my left, and there
were two young boys of the Ansar, and I hoped that I was stronger than them.
One of them nudged me and asked, 'Uncle, do you recognise Abu Jahl?' I replied,
'Yes, what do you want of him, nephew?' He said, 'I have been informed that
he insulted the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and by the One in whose hand my soul is, if I see him, then my person will
not part from his person until one of us dies.' I was astonished at that.
Then the other nudged me and said the like of it to me. It was quite soon
that I saw Abu Jahl going aroung the people and I said, 'This is the one
you asked me about!' So they went for him with their swords and they struck
him until he was killed him. Then they went to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told him. He said, 'Which one of
you killed him?' Each of them said, 'I killed him.' He asked, 'Have you wiped
your swords?' They answered, 'No.' He looked at the swords and said, 'Both
of you killed him, and the spoils will given to Mu'adh ibn 'Amr ibn al-Jamuh.'
They were Mu'adh ibn 'Afra' and Mu'adh ibn 'Amr ibn al-Jamuh."
<P>
2973. It is related that Abu Qatada said, "We went out with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of Hunayn.
When we met the enemy, the Muslims were routed. I saw a man of the idolaters
over a man of the Muslims, and I turned around until I reached him from behind
and hit with the sword on the shoulder vein. He turned against me and seized
me so fiercely that I felt death approaching. Then death overcame him and
he released me. I caught up to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab and asked, 'What is wrong
with the people?' He answered, 'The command of Allah.' Then the people returned.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sat and said, 'Whoever
killed someone and has proof of it will have his spoils.' I stood up and
said, 'Who will testify for me?' Then I sat down. Then he said, 'Whoever
killed someone and has proof of it will have his spoils.' I stood up and
said, 'Who will testify for me?' Then I sat down. Then he said the like of
it a third time. I stood up and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'What is wrong, Abu Qatada?' I recounted the story
to him and a man said, 'He spoke the truth, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. I have his spoils with me, so give him compensation for me.' Abu
Bakr as-Siddiq said, 'No, by Allah, he will not go to one of the lions of
Allah who fought for Allah and His Mesenger to give you his spoils.' The
Prophet. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'He spoke the truth,'
and he gave them and I sold the armour and with it I bought a garden in the
Banu Salama, and it was the first property which I gained in Islam.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: What the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave to
reconcile people's hearts and to other people from the khumus and its like</B>
<P>
'Abdullah ibn Zayd related it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. (see 4075)
<P>
2974. It is related that Hakim ibn Hizam said, "I asked the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to give to me, and he gave
to me and then I asked him and he gave to me and then I asked him again and
he gave to me. Then he said, 'Hakim, wealth is verdant and sweet. Anyone
who takes it in a generous spirit will be blessed in it but anyone who takes
it in an avaricious way will not be blessed in it, like someone who eats
and is not satisfied. The upper hand is better than the lower hand.'" Hakim
said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, by the One who sent you with the Truth,
I will never again ask anyone for anything until I leave this world.'" Abu
Bakr called Hakim to take his share and he refused to take it from him. Then
'Umar called him to give to him and he refused to accept anything from him
either. 'Umar said, "I call on you to testify, company of Muslims, that I
offered Hakim his share of this booty and he refused to take it. Hakim did
not take anything from any person after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, until he died.
<P>
2975. It is related from Nafi' that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "O Messenger
of Allah, "I vowed during the time of <I>Jahiliyya</I> to do <I>i'tikaf </I>for
one day." He commanded him to fulfil the vow.
<P>
Nafi' said, "'Umar received two slave-girls from the captives of Hunayn and
put them in one of his houses in Makka." He said, "When the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, freely released the captives
of Hunayn, they began to walk about in the streets. 'Umar said, ''Abdullah!
Go and see what has happened!' He said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, has freely released the captives.' He said,
'Go and release the two girls.'"
<P>
Nafi' said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
did not make <I>'umra </I>from al-Ji'rana. If he had done so, that would
not have been concealed from 'Abdullah."
<P>
Nafi' added that Ibn 'Umar said, "They were part of the <I>khumus</I>."
<P>
Nafi' related it from Ibn 'Umar about vows, but did not say "a day".
<P>
2976. It is related that 'Amr ibn Taghlib said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave to some people and denied others
and it seemed that they were critical of him. So he said, 'I give to some
people fearing lest they should incline away and not be patient, while I
entrust other people to what Allah has placed in their hearts of good and
wealth. One of them is 'Amr ibn Taghlib.'" 'Amr ibn Taghlib said, "The words
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, are dearer
to me than to red camels."
<P>
'Amr ibn Taghlib related that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was brought some money or captives and shared them out.
<P>
2977. It is related that Anas said, "I give to Quraysh to reconcile them
because they are near to their pact with <I>Jahiliyya</I>."
<P>
2978. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that when Allah gave the booty which
He gave to His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Hawazin,
and he began to give a hundred camels to some men of Quraysh, some of the
Ansar said about the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, "May Allah forgive the Messenger of Allah! He gives to Quraysh and
leaves us out even though our swords are dripping with their blood." Anas
said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
informed about what they said and so he sent to the Ansar and gathered them
together in a hide tent. He did not invite anyone else with them. When they
were together, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, came to them and said, 'What is this talk which I have heard that
you said?' Those with understanding among them said to him, 'Those of us
whose opinion carries weight did not say anything, Messenger of Allah. However,
some of the young people among us said, "May Allah give the Messenger of
Allah! He gives to Quraysh and leaves us out even though our swords are dripping
with their blood."' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'I give to men who were recently unbelievers. Are you not
pleased to let people go with property while you return to your homes with
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace? By Allah,
You will return with better than what they are returning with.' They said,
'Yes,indeed, Messenger of Allah, we are pleased!' He said to them, 'You will
see great self-interest after me, so be steadfast until you meet Allah Almighty
and His Messenger at the Basin.'" Anas said, "But we were not steadfast."
<P>
2979. It is related from Jubayr ibn Mut'im that while he was travelling with
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with some
people while returning from Hunayn, some people began to cling to him asking
him until they forced him back against an acacia tree and his cloak was snatched
away. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stopped and said,
"Give me &nbsp;back my cloak. If I had had camels as many as these trees,
I would have divided them between you and then you will not find me to be
a miser, a liar nor a coward."
<P>
2980. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "I was walking with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who was wearing a Najrani cloak
with a thick hem when a desert Arab caught up to him and pulled it fiercely
so that I saw the side of the Prophet's neck, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was marked by the hem of the cloak due to the intensity of the
tugging. Then he said, 'Order for me some of the property of Allah which
you have with you!' He turned to him and laughed, and ordered that he be
given a gift."
<P>
2981. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "On the Day of Hunayn, the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, favoured some people over
others in his division of the spoils. He gave al-Aqra' ibn Habis a hundred
camels and gave 'Uyayna ibn Hisn the same. He also gave to some of the Arab
nobles and favoured them in the division that day. A man said, 'By Allah,
this a division which lacks justice and by which the face of Allah is not
desired.' I said, 'By Allah, I will inform the Messenger of Allah!' So I
went to him and informed him about what the man had said. His face changed
colour until it was red and then he said, 'Who will be just if Allah and
His Messenger are not just?' Then he said, 'May Allah have mercy on Musa!
He was abused more than this and he was patient.'"
<P>
2982. It is related that Asma' bint Abi Bakr said, "I used to carry date-stones
on my head from the land of az-Zubayr which had been granted to him by the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it was
two-thirds of a farsakh away."
<P>
It is related from Hisham's father that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, granted az-Zubayr a piece of land from the property
of the Banu an-Nadir.
<P>
2983. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab expelled the
Jews and Christians from the land of the Hijaz. When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, conquered Khaybar, he wanted to
remove the Jews from it. When he conquered it, the land was for Allah and
His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Muslims.
He wanted to remove the Jews from it and the Jews asked the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to let them remain there
and they would do the work on it and have half of the fruits. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to them, "We will
let you remain in that as long as we wish," and they remained there until
'Umar expelled them to Tayma' and Ariha'.
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: Food which is taken from the land of the enemy</B>
<P>
2984. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal said, "While we were laying
siege to the fortress of Khaybar, someone threw a leather bag contained ghee
and I rushed to get it. I turned and there was the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and I was embarrassed before him."
<P>
2985. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "In our expedition we used to get
honey and grapes which we would eat and not store up."
<P>
2986. It is related that Ibn Abi Awfa was heard to say, "In the days of Khaybar
we were afflicted with hunger. On the day of the Battle of Khaybar, we caught
and slaughtered domestic donkeys, and when the pots were boiling, the proclaimer
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, announced,
'Turn over the pots and do not eat any of the meat of the donkeys.'" 'Abdullah
said, "We said, 'The Prophet, forbade them because the <I>khumus</I> had
not been taken from them.'" He said, Others said, 'He has made them absolutely
unlawful.' I asked Sa'id ibn al-Jubayr who said, 'He has made them absolutely
unlawful.'"

of Jaz' ibn Mu'awiya, the uncle of al-Ahnaf. A letter reached us from 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab a year before he died: "Separate every marriage between forbidden
degrees of the Magians." 'Umar did not take <I>jizya</I> from the Magians
until 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf testified that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had taken it from the Magians of Hajar.'"
<P>
[Hajar is in Bahrayn]
<P>
2988. It is related from 'Amr ibn 'Awf al-Ansari, who was an ally of the
Banu 'Amir ibn Lu'ayy and who was present at Badr, that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah
to Bahrayn to collect their <I>jizya</I>. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had made a truce with the people of Bahrayn
and appointed al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami as their governor. Abu 'Ubayda brought
the money from Bahrayn and the Ansar heard of the arrival of Abu 'Ubadya
which was at the time of the <I>Subh</I> prayer with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. When he had prayed <I>Fajr</I> with them and
finished, they presented themselves before him and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smiled when he saw them. He said,
'I think you must have heard that Abu 'Ubayda has arrived with something?'
They said, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Rejoice, and hope for what
will gladden you. By Allah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, but I
fear that this world will be spread out in front of you as it was spread
out in front of those before you, and then you will vie for it as they vied
for it, and it will destroy you as it destroyed them.'"
<P>
2989. It is related that Jubayr ibn Hayya said, "'Umar sent people to the
regions of the great countries to fight the idolaters. Al-Hurmuzan became
Muslim and 'Umar said, 'I want to consult you about these expeditions.' He
said, 'Yes, the example of them and the enemies of the Muslims who are in
them is like a bird which has a head, two wings, and two legs. If one of
its wings is broken, it gets up on its legs with one wing and the head. If
the other wing is broken, it gets up on the two legs and the head. But if
the head is broken, then the legs, wings and head are gone. The head is Chosroes,
the wing is Caesar and the other wing is Faris. Therefore command the Muslims
to make for Chosroes.'"
<P>
Jubayr ibn Hayya said, "So 'Umar detailed us and appointed an-Nu'man ibn
Muqarran over us. When we reached enemy territory, the agent of Chosroes
came out to us with forty thousand men. An interpreter stood up and said,
'Let a man among you speak to me.' Al-Mughira said, 'Ask whatever you like.'
He said, 'Who are you?' He replied, 'We are people of the Arabs. We used
to be in terrible hardship and severe affliction. We would suck hides and
date-stones out of hunger and we wore camel hair and goat hair. We used to
worship trees and stones. While we were like that, the Lord of the heavens
and the Lord of the earths - may His mention be exalted and His immensity
magnified! - sent us a Prophet from among ourselves whose father and mother
we knew. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, has commanded us to fight you until you worship Allah alone
or pay the <I>jizya</I>. Out Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
has informed us from the message of our Lord: whoever of us is killed will
go to the Garden in bliss whose like he has never seen. Whoever of us remains
will be your masters.'
<P>
"An-Nu'man said, 'If Allah had made you be present at the like of it with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he would not have made
you regret waiting nor disgraced you. But I was present with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the fighting, and when
he did not fight at the beginning of the day, he would wait until the winds
blew and it was time for the prayer.' [meaning when the day was cooler]"
<P>
[Faris was a region of Persia.
<P>
An-Nu'man's comments are in answer to al-Mughira's objection to the decision
to delay the attack.]
<P>
<P>
<B>II: When the ruler concludes a truce with the King of a country, does
that hold for the rest of them?</B>
<P>
2990. It is related that Abu Humayd as-Sa'idi said, "We went on an expedition
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to Tabuk and the
king of Ayla gave the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a
while mule and a cloak, and the Prophet wrote for him that he had authority
over his land."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: Instructions in regard to the people who have a covenant
(<I>dhimma</I>) with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace</B>
<P>
<I>Dhimma</I> is the covenant and <I>ill</I> means kinship (9:8,10).
<P>
2991. It is related that Juwayriya ibn Qudama at-Tamimi said, "I heard 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab. We had said to him, 'Instruct us, Amir al-Mu'minin!' He said,
'I instruct you to fulfil the contract of the <I>dhimma</I> of Allah. It
is the <I>dhimma</I> of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and provision for your dependants.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: On the land grants that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, made in Bahrayn and what he promised people out of the money and
<I>jizya</I> of Bahrayn. Among whom should the spoils and jizya be
distributed?</B>
<P>
2992. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, summoned the Ansar to write out for them land in Bahrayn.
They said, 'No, by Allah, not unless you write out the like of it for our
brothers of Quraysh. He said, 'They will have that if Allah wills.' They
spoke to him and he said, "You will find self-seeking after I have gone,
so be steadfast until you meet me at the Basin."
<P>
2993. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'If the money from Bahrayn
comes to us, I will give you such-and-such.' The money from Bahrayn did not
come until after the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
died. When the money of Bahrayn arrived, Abu Bakr said, 'Whoever has a promise
from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, should come to
us.' I came to him and said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, told me "If the money from Bahrayn comes to us, I will give you
such-and-such."'. He said to me, 'Scoop up,' and I scooped up. He said, 'Count
it.' I counted them and there were five hundred. He gave me one thousand
five hundred."
<P>
2994. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was brought some goods from Bahrayn. He said, "Lay them
out in the mosque.' It was the largest amount that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had ever received. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to the prayer
and did not even glance at them. When he finished the prayer, he came and
sat down by them. He gave something to everyone he saw. When al-'Abbas came
to him, he said, 'Messenger of Allah, give some to me, for I ransomed myself
and 'Aqil.'' He said to him, 'Take some.' He filled up his garment and then
tried to lift it but could not. He said, 'Messenger of Allah, tell someone
to help me lift it.' He answered, 'No.' Then he asked, 'Then you help me
lift it?' He said, 'No.' So he discarded some of it and then tried to lift
it again and said, 'Messenger of Allah, tell one of them to help me lift
it.' He replied, 'No.' He said, 'Then you help me lift it?' He said, 'No.'
So he discarded some more and hoisted it up onto his shoulders and left.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, continued
to follow him with his eye until he disappeared from view out of astonishment
at his greed. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
did not get up until there was not a dirham of it left."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The sin of someone who kills a person with a treaty without him having
commmitted a crime</B>
<P>
2995. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever kills someone with a treaty
will not experience the fragrance of the Garden although its fragrance can
be experienced at a distance of forty years."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Expelling the Jews from the Arabian peninsula</B>
<P>
'Umar said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"We will let you remain in that as long as Allah lets you remain there."
<P>
2996. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "While we were in the mosque,
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out
and said, 'Go to the Jews.' We went out until we came to the house of al-Midras.
He said, 'Become Muslim and you will be safe. Know that the earth belongs
to Allah and His Messenger. I want to expel you from this land. Whoever of
you has some property should sell it. However, the earth belongs to Allah
and His Messenger.'"
<P>
2997. It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr that he heard Ibn 'Abbas saying,
"'Thursday! What is Thursday!'" and then he wept until his tears made the
pebbles wet. I said, 'Abu 'Abbas! What is it about Thursday!' He said, 'The
Prophet's pain became intense and he said, "Bring me a shoulder so that I
may write a document for you after which you will never go astray." They
quarrelled, although it is not proper to quarrel in the presence of a Prophet.
They said, "What is wrong with him? Is he delirious? Ask him." He said, "Leave
me. That which I am in is better than that to which you call me." He gave
them three commands and said, "Expel the idolaters from the Arabian peninsula,
give gifts to the delegations as I used to give them gifts."'" "The third
was something good which either he was silent about or which he said and
I forgot." Sufyan said that this is part of what Sulayman said.
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: When the idolaters act with treachery towards the Muslims, can they
be forgiven?</B>
<P>
2998. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When Khaybar was conquered, a
poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Gather
for me all the Jews who are here.' They were gathered for him and he said,
'I am going to ask you about something. Will you tell me the truth about
it?' They said, 'Yes.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said to them, 'Who is your father?' They replied, 'So-and-so.' He said, 'You
have lied. Your father is so-and-so.' They said, 'You spoke the truth.' He
said, 'So now will you tell me the truth about something if I ask you about
it?' They answered, 'Yes, Abu'l-Qasim. If we lie, you will recognise our
lie as you recognised it regarding our father.' He asked them, 'Who are the
people of the Fire?' They said, 'We will be in it for a short time and then
you will follow us in it.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'May you be basely driven into it! By Allah, we will never follow
you in it!' Then he said, 'Will you tell me the truth about something if
I ask you about it?' They said, 'Yes, Abu'l-Qasim.' He asked, 'Did you put
poison in this sheep?' They said, 'Yes.' He said, 'What made you do that?'
They said, 'If you were a liar, then we would be relieved of you. If you
are a Prophet, then it would not harm you.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: The ruler cursing those who have broken a treaty</B>
<P>
2999. It is related that 'Asim said, "I asked Anas ibn Malik about the
<I>qunut</I> and he said, 'It is done before <I>ruku'</I>.'" He said, "Someone
claims that you said it was done after <I>ruku'</I>. He said, 'He lied.'
Then he related from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, that he only did the <I>qunut</I> after <I>ruku' </I>for a month,
in which he made supplication against the tribes from the Banu Sulaym. He
said, "He sent out forty - or seventy (he was unsure about it) - reciters"
to some people of the idolaters. Those people attacked them and killed them,
although there they had a treaty with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. I have never seen him as grieved for anyone as he
was for them.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Offering of security and sanctuary by women</B>
<P>
3000. It is related that Abu Murra, the mawla of Umm Hani' bint Abi Talib,
heard Umm Hani' bint Abi Talib say, "I went to the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of the Conquest of Makka
and found him doing <I>ghusl</I>, with his daughter Fatima screening him.
I greeted him and he said, 'Who is this?' I said, 'It is Umm Hani' bint Abi
Talib.' He said, 'Welcome, Umm Hani'.' When he finished his <I>ghusl</I>,
he stood up and prayed eight <I>rak'ats </I>wrapped in a single cloth. When
he finished, I said, 'Messenger of Allah, my brother claims that he is going
to kill a man to whom I have given sanctuary. It is so-and-so, the son of
Hubayra.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'We
give sanctuary to the one to whom you have given sanctuary, Umm Hani'.'"
Umm Hani' said that that happened in the morning. 
<P>
<P>
<B>X: The <I>dhimma</I> and sanctuary of the Muslims is the same, and it
is effected by the lowest of them</B>
<P>
3001. It is related that the father of Ibrahim at-Tamimi said, "'Ali addressed
us, saying, 'We have no book that we read but the Book of Allah and this
paper which contains [judgements about] wounds and the ages of camels: "Madina
is a sanctuary between 'A'ir to such-and-such a place. Whoever commits an
improper action in it or gives refuge to someone who commits improper actions,
on him is the curse of Allah, the angels and all people. Neither repentance
nor ransom will be accepted from him. Whoever accepts the proctectorship
of other than his masters will have the like of that curse. The <I>dhimma</I>
[covenant] of the Muslims is the same. Whoever breaks a Muslim's covenant,
on him is the like of that curse."'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: When they say, <I>"Saba'na</I>" and do not say "We have become Muslim"
(<I>aslamna</I>) properly</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Umar said, "Khalid began killing (them) and the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'O Allah, I declare myself innocent to You
of what Khalid has done.'"
<P>
'Umar said, "If someone says, '<I>Matras</I>' [Persian for 'Do not fear'],
he is granting security. Allah knows all the tongues." He said, "Speak, there
is no harm." [Said to al-Hurmurzan and is said to grant security]
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Making peace and truces with the idolaters for money and other things.
The wrong action of someone who does not abide by the treaty.</B>
<P>
The words of Allah, <I>"If they incline to peace, incline to it as well."
</I>(8:61)
<P>
3002. It is related that Sahl ibn Hathma al-Ansari said, "'Abdullah ibn Sahl
and Muhayyisa ibn Mas'ud ibn Zayd went to Khaybar at a time when there was
a truce. They parted and then Muhayyisa came upon 'Abdullah ibn Sahl, murdered
and covered in blood. He buried him and then went to Madina. Then 'Abdu'r-Rahman
ibn Sahl, and Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa, the sons of Mas'ud, went to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and 'Abdu'r-Rahman began to speak.
He said, 'The eldest, the eldest.' for he was the youngest of the people
there. So he was silent, and the two of them spoke. He said, 'Do you swear
(to this) and demand your right from the murderer - or your companion?' They
asked, 'How can we swear when we did not witness it or see it?' He said,
'Then the Jews can clear themselves by fifty men taking an oath.' They said,
'How can you accept the oaths of a people of unbelievers!' So the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, himself paid the blood money.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: The excellence of fulfilling the terms of a treaty</B>
<P>
3003. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said that Abu Sufyan ibn Harb
informed him that Heraclius had sent a message to him while he was with a
Qurayshi caravan composed of merchants who were trading in Syria during the
period when the the Messenger of Allah , may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, had a truce with Abu Sufyan and the unbelievers of Quraysh.
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Is a <I>dhimmi</I> pardoned when he practises magic?</B>
<P>
Ibn Shihab was asked, "Is one of the people with a treaty killed if he practises
magic?" He answered, "It has reached us that that was done to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, but he did not kill the
one who had done it, and he was one of the People of the Book."
<P>
3004. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was bewitched so that he imagined that he had done something
when he had not done it.
<P>
[That was Labid ibn al-A'sam.]
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Being on guard against treachery</B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"If they intend to deceive you, Allah is
enough for you..." </I>(8:62)
<P>
3005. It is related that 'Awf ibn Malik said, "I went to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, during the Tabuk expedition while he
was in a hide tent. He said, 'Count six signs before the Hour: my death,
then the conquest of Jerusalem, then a plague which will carry you off like
the sheep disease, then the increase of wealth so that a man will be given
a hundred dinars and remain displeased, then a civil war (<I>fitna</I>) which
will not fail to enter every house of the Arabs, and then a truce between
you and the Greeks who will act treacherously and come at you under eighty
flags with twelve thousand men under every flag.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: How to revoke a treaty</B>
<P>
The words of Allah, <I>"If you fear treachery on a people's part, revoke
your treaty with them mutually...." </I>(8:58)
<P>
3006. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Abu Bakr sent me with the callers
who announced at Mina on the Day of Sacrifice, 'No pagan is to make the hajj
after this year and no one is to do <I>tawaf</I> of the House naked.' The
day of the Greater Hajj is the Day of Sacrifice. It is called 'the greater"
because people say, 'the lesser Hajj.' So Abu Bakr revoked the treaty with
people that year, and so no pagan made hajj in the year of the Farewell Hajj
in which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made hajj."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: The wrong action of someone who makes a treaty and then acts
treacherously</B>
<P>
His words, <I>"Those with whom you make a treaty and who then break it every
time. They are not godfearing." </I>(8:56)
<P>
3007. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone has four
characteristics, he is [like] a pure hypocrite: whenever he speaks, he lies;
whenever he is trusted, he betrays his trust; when he makes an agreement,
he breaks it; and when he quarrels, he deviates from the truth and speaks
falsely. Iif anyone has one of them, he has an aspect of hypocrisy until
he gives it up."
<P>
3008. It is related that 'Ali said, "We have nothing written down from the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,but the Qur'an and this
paper. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: "Madina
is a sanctuary between 'A'ir to such-and-such a place. Whoever commits an
improper action in it or gives refuge to someone who commits improper actions,
on him is the curse of Allah, the angels and all people. Neither repentance
nor ransom will be accepted from him. The <I>dhimma</I> [covenant] of the
Muslims is the same, and it is effective by the lowest of them. Whoever breaks
a Muslim's covenant, on him is the curse of Allah, the angels and all people.
Neither repentance nor ransom will be accepted from him. Whoever accepts
the protectorship of a people without his masters's permission on him is
the curse of Allah, the angels and all people. Neither repentance nor ransom
will be accepted from him.'"
<P>
3009. It is related that Abu Hurayra remarked, "How will you be when you
do not collect either dinar or dirham?" He was asked, "How do you know that
will come about, Abu Hurayra?" He said, "By the One in Whose hand is the
soul of Abu Hurayra, from the words of the truth confirmed one." They asked,
"What is that?" He answered, "The <I>dhimma</I> of Allah and His Messenger
will be violated and so Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, will strengthen the
hearts of the people of the <I>dhimma</I> so that they refuse to pay what
they owe."
<P>
3010. It is related that al-A'mash said, "I asked Abu Wa'il, 'Were you present
at Siffin?' He answered, 'Yes, and I heard Sahl ibn Hunayf say, "Have doubts
about your opinions! You should have seen me on the day of Abu Jandal! If
I had been able to defy the order of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, I would have defied it. We did not remove our swords from
our shoulders for something which outraged us, and it was easier for us to
recognise (the good in it) which is not the case in this business of ours."'"
<P>
[Siffin was the battle between 'Ali and Mu'awiya. Sahl was criticised for
his lack of enthusiasm for the fight. Abu Jandal came to the Muslims in chains
after the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyya had been concluded, and was handed back
to Quraysh according to the terms of the treaty.]
<P>
3011. It is related that Abu Wa'il said, "We were at Siffin and Sahl ibn
Hunayf stood up and said, 'O people! Doubt yourselves! We were with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of al-Hudaybiyya,
and if we had thought it proper to fight, we would have fought. 'Umar ibn
al-Khattab came and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, do we not have the truth
while our enemy have the false?' He said, 'Yes indeed.' He said, "Are not
our dead in the Garden while their dead are in the Fire?' He said, 'Yes indeed.'
He said, Then why do we concede humbleness in our <I>deen</I>? Will we go
back without Allah having judged between us and them?' He said, 'O Ibn
al-Khattab, I am the Messenger of Allah and He will never neglect me.' Then
'Umar went to Abu Bakr and said to him the like of what he had said to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr said, 'He
is the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and He
will never neglect him.' Then <I>Surat al-Fath </I>(48) was sent down and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, read it
to 'Umar to the end of it and 'Umar said, 'Messenger of Allah, was that the
victory?' He said, 'Yes.'"
<P>
3012. It is related that Asma' bint Abi Bakr said, "My mother came to visit
me with her father during the period when Quraysh had a treaty with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while she was still an
idolater and I asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, 'My mother has come to me, wanting something. Shall I give it
to her?' He replied, 'Yes. Give to your mother.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: A truce for three day or a specified period</B>
<P>
3013. It is related that al-Bara' said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, wanted to go on <I>'umra</I>, he sent to the people
of Makka to ask their permission to enter Makka. They made a stipulation
that he would only remain there for three days and that no one would enter
it except with weapons sheathed, and that he would not invite any of them
[to Islam]." He said, "So 'Ali ibn Abi Talib began to write the stipulations
between them, and he wrote, 'This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, agrees to.' They said, 'If we knew
that you were the Messenger of Allah, we would not have prevented you and
we would have offered allegiance to you. Rather write, "This is Muhammad
ibn 'Abdullah decides."' He said, 'By Allah, I am Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah,
and, by Allah, I am the Messenger of Allah.' He did not write." He said,
"So he said to 'Ali, 'Rub out "Messenger of Allah".' 'Ali said, 'By Allah,
I will never rub it out!' He said, 'Show it to me.'" He said, "He showed
it to him and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, rubbed
it out with his hand. When he had entered Makka and the days had passed,
they went to 'Ali and said, 'Tell your companion to depart.' He mentioned
that to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said, 'Yes,' and then departed." 
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: A truce without a specific time</B>
<P>
The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "We will
let you remain in that as long as Allah lets you remain there." (see 2213)
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: Throwing the corpses of idolaters into a well and not taking any price
for them</B>
<P>
3014. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "While the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in prostration, surrounded by some
of the idolaters of Quraysh, 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt brought the foetal membrance
of a young camel and threw it on the back of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace. He did not raise his head until Fatima came and
removed it from his back. Then he pronounced an invocation against those
who had done that. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'O Allah! Destroy the council of Quraysh! O Allah, destroy Abu Jahl
ibn Hisham, 'Utba ibn Rabi'a, Shayba ibn Rabi'a, 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt, and
Umayya ibn Khalaf! (or and Ubayy ibn Khalaf)' I saw them killed on the day
of Badr and they were thrown into the well, except for Umayya or Ubayy. He
was a fat man and when they dragged him, his joints separated before he was
thrown into the well."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: The wrong action someone treacherous, whether he does that to a pious
or a corrupt person</B>
<P>
3015. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Every traitor will have a banner on the Day of Rising."
One of them said, "It will be fixed," and the other said, "It will be shown
on the Day of Rising so that he is recognised by it."
<P>
3016. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Every traitor will have a banner fixed
because of his treachery.'"
<P>
3017. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "On the day of the Conquest of
Makka, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'There is no more <I>hijra</I>, but there is <I>jihad</I> and intention.
When you are called to it then go.' He said on the day of the Conquest of
Makka, 'Allah made this city inviolable on the day when he created the heavens
and the earth and it will be inviolable by Allah's sanctity until the Day
of Rising. Fighting was not lawful in it for anyone before me and it was
only lawful for me for one hour of one day. It will remain inviolable by
Allah's sanctity until the Day of Rising. Its thorns should not be cut, its
game should not be chased and something dropped should not be picked up except
by someone who announces it and its plants are not to be pulled up.' Al-'Abbas
said, 'Messenger of Allah, apart from the <I>idhkhir</I> herb for our goldsmiths
and houses!' He said, 'Apart from the <I>idhkhir</I> herb.'"
