</b></p>
<p> </p>

<p>	6937. Abu Ma'bad related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent Mu'adh to Yemen. </p>
<p>	Abu Ma'bad, the client of Ibn 'Abbas, was heard to say, "I heard Ibn 'Abbas say, 'When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent Mu'adh ibn Jabal to the people of Yemen, he said, "You are going to a people who are among the People of the Book. The first thing you call them to should be to say that Allah Almighty is one. When they acknowledge that, then tell them that Allah has made the five prayers obligatory for them in a twenty-four day. When they do the prayer, inform them that Allah has made it obligatory for <i>zakat</i> to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they affirm that, take it from them but avoid people's most prized property."'"</p>
<p>	6938. Al-Aswad ibn Hilal related from Mu'adh ibn Jabal that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Mu'adh, do you know what is Allah's right on His slaves?" "Allah and His Messenger know best," he answered. He said, "Allah's right on His slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. Do you know what is the right of the slaves on Allah?" "Allah and His Messenger know best," he replied. He said, "That He will not punish them."</p>
<p>	6939. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that a man heard another man reciting, <i>"Say: He is Allah, Absolute Oneness"</i> (112:1) and he repeated it. In the morning he went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned that to him. It seemed as if the man thought that it was insufficient. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "By the One who has my soul in His hand, It is equal to a third of the Qur'an."</p>
<p>	Isma'il ibn Ja'far added in an <i>isnad</i> from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, "My brother, Qatada ibn an-Nu'man, informed me from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace..."
</p>
<p>	6940. Abu'r-Rijal Muhammad ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related from his mother, 'Amra bint 'Abdu'r-Rahman, who was in the care of 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent a man in charge of an expedition. This man used to recite for his companions in the prayer and conclude with [the <i>sura</i>]<i> "Say: He is Allah, Absolute Oneness".</i> When they returned, they mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who said, "Ask him why he does that." They asked him and he answered. "Because it is the description of the All-Merciful and I love to recite it." The Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Tell him that Allah loves him."</p>

<p><b>II. The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Say: 'Call on Allah or call on the All-Merciful, whichever you call upon, the Most Beautiful Names are His.''" </i>(17:110)</b></p>
<p>	6941. Zayd ibn Wahb and Abu Zhubtan related from Jarir ibn 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah will not show mercy to someone who does not show mercy to people."</p>
<p>	6942. Abu 'Uthman an-Nahdi related that Usama ibn Zayd said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a messenger came to him from one his daughters asking him to come to her son who was dying. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Go back and tell her that what Allah takes is his and what He gives is His. Everything has a fixed term with Him, so she should show fortitude and expect a reward.' She sent back to the Messenger adjuring him to come to her. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up with Sa'd ibn 'Ubada and Mu'adh ibn Jabal. The child was handed to him while it was shuddering like an old waterskin. The Prophet's eyes were flowing with tears and Sa'd asked him, 'Messenger of Allah, what is this?' He answered, 'This is an aspect of mercy which Allah has put in the hearts of His slaves. Allah is merciful to His slaves who are merciful.'"

<p>	Yahya [ibn Ziyad al-Farra'] said [in <i>The Meanings of the Qur'an</i>], "<i>Az-Zahir</i>, (the Outward)  who has knowledge of everything outwardly and <i>al-Batin</i>,  (the Inward) who has knowledge of everything inwardly."</p>
<p>[al-Qastallani: "Others say that <i>az-Zahir</i> is the One whose existence is manifest by His radiant signs in His earth and heaven, and <i>al-Batin</i> is the One whose being is veiled from the investigation of the intellect by the veils of His greatness. It is said that He is Outwardly Manifest by His power and Inwardly Hidden from thought. It is said that He is Manifest without drawing near and Inward without being veiled. Shaykh Abu Hamid said, "Know that He is hidden in spite of His manifestation because of the intensity of His manifestation, and His manifestation is the reason for His hiddenness. His light is the veil of His light." It is said that He is manifest bu His blessings and Inward by His mercy. It is said that He is Manifest by the gifts and blessings He bestows on you and Inward by the trials He averts from you. I is said that He is Manifest to some people and that is by they proclaim Him one, and Hidden from some people, which is why they deny Him."]

You have power and I do not. You know and I do not. You are the Knower of the Unseen worlds. O Allah, if You know that this matter (and you name your business) is good for me sooner and later (or he said, "in my <i>deen</i> and my livelihood and the end of my affair"), then ordain it for me and make it easy for me and then bless me in it.

Intercede on our behalf with your Lord to relieve us from this place where we are!' He will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mention his error and say, 'Go to Nuh. He is the first Messenger that Allah sent to the people of the earth.'

When I see my Lord, I will fall down in prostration and He will leave me as long as Allah wills to leave me. Then I will be told, 'Raise your head, Muhammad. Speak and it will be heard. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and intercession will be granted.' I will lift my head and praise Him with praises which my Lord will teach me. Then I will intercede and He will fix an amount for me and I will let them into the Garden. Then I will return and when I see my Lord, I will fall down in prostration and He will leave me as long as Allah wills to leave me. Then I will be told, 'Raise your head, Muhammad. Speak and it will be heard. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and intercession will be granted.' I will lift my head and praise Him with praises which my Lord will teach me. Then I will intercede and He will fix an amount for me and I will let them into the Garden. Then I will return and say, "O Lord, only those remain in the Fire whom the Qur'an has held and for whom being in it for ever is obliged."' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Anyone who said, "There is no god but Allah" and has the weight of a grain of barley of good in his heart will come out of the Fire. Then anyone who said "There is no god but Allah" and has the weight of a grain of what of good in his heart will come out of the Fire.

'Abida related from 'Abdullah that a Jew went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Muhammad, Allah will hold the heavens on a finger, the earths on a finger, the mountains on a finger, the trees on a finger and creatures on a finger and then He will say, 'I am the King,' The Messenger of Allah  * laughed until his molars showed and then recited, <i>'They do not measure Allah with His true measure. '</i> (39:67)"</p>
<p>	'Abida related from 'Abdullah, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughed out of amazement and affirmation of him."</p>
<p>	6979. 'Alqama was heard to say that 'Abdullah said, "A man of the People of the Book came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Abu'l-Qasim, Allah will hold the heavens on a finger, earths on one finger, trees and earth on one finger, and creatures on one finger and then He will say, 'I am the King. I am the King,' I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smiled until his molars showed. Then he recited, <i>'They do not measure Allah with His true measure. '</i> (39:67)"</p>

<p><b>XX. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "There is no person more jealous than Allah"</b></p>
<p>	6980. Al-Mughira said that Asa'd ibn 'Ubada said, "If I were to see a man with my wife, I would strike him with the sharp edge of a sword!" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, heard about that and said, "Are you amazed at the jealousy of Sa'd? By Allah, I am more jealous than him, and Allah is more jealous than me. It is because of Allah's jealousy that He has forbidden lewd actions, public and secret. There is none who loves the apology more than Allah and it is for this that He sent those who give good news and warning. There is no one who likes to be praised more than Allah. Allah has promised the Garden because of that."
</p>

<p><b>XXI. <i>"Say: 'What thing is greatest as a witness?' Say: 'Allah. '" </i>(6:19)</b></p>
<p>	Allah Almighty called Himself a thing, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called the Qur'an a thing, and it is one of the attributes of Allah. He says, <i>"All things are passing except His Face."</i> (28:88)</p>
<p>	6981. Abu Hazim related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked a man, "Do you have any of the Qur'an?" "Yes," he replied, "such-and-such a <i>sura</i> and such-and-such a <i>sura</i>," and he named some <i>sura</i>s.</p>


<p><b>XXII.  <i>"When His Throne was on the water." </i>(11:7) <i>"And He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne"</i> (27:26)</b></p>
<p>	Abu'l-'Aliyya said that <i>"established Himself "(istawa) on the Throne" </i>means "is high" and <i>"made them (sawwahunna) into seven heavens"</i> (2:29) means "created them".</p>
<p>	Mujahid said that <i>istawa</i> means "to be high over the Throne".</p>
<p>	Ibn 'Abbas said that <i>Majid</i> (85:15) means "Noble" and <i>Wadud</i> (85:14) means "Loved." One says <i>"ham”dun maj”dun"</i> as if it was the <i>fa'”l</i> form of <i>míjid</i> and praised (<i>mahmud</i>) comes from <i>hamida</i>.</p>
<p>	6982. Safwan ibn Muhriz related that 'Imran ibn Husayn said, "I was with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when some people from the Banu Tamim came to him. He said, 'Banu Tamim, accept the good news!' they said, 'You have given us good news, so give us something.' Some of the people of Yemen entered and he said, 'Accept the good news, people of Yemen since Banu Tamim have not accepted it!' They said, 'We accept. We have come to you to learn about the deen and to ask you about how this business [the creation of the world] began.' He said, 'There was Allah and nothing was before Him. His Throne was on the water. Then He created the heavens and the earth and wrote everything in the Remembrance [the Preserved Tablet].' Then a man came and said, ''Imran! Catch your camel. It has gone.' I went to look for it and could not see her because of the mirage. By Allah, I wish that it had gone and I had stayed!"</p>
<p>	6983. Hammam related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophett, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The right hand of Allah is full and is not decreased by His unceasing spending night and day. Do you see what He has spent since He created the heavens and the earth? It has not decreased what is in His hand. His Throne is over the water and  favour or contraction is in His other hand. He raises some and lowers others."</p>
<p>	6984. Thabit related that Anas said, "Zayd ibn Haritha came to complain [about his wife, Zaynab bin Jahsh] and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to say, 'Fear Allah and keep your wife.'" Anas said, "If the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had concealed anything, he would have concealed this."</p>
<p>	He said, "Zaynab used to boast about herself in relation to the other wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying, "You were given in marriage by your families and Allah Almighty from above the seven heavens gave me in marriage."</p>
<p>	Thabit said, <i>"'...while concealing something in yourself which Allah wished to bring to light, you were fearing people... ' </i>(33:37) was revealed about Zaynab and Zayd ibn Haritha."</p>
<p>	6985. Isa ibn Tahman said, "I heard Anas ibn Malik say, 'The <i>Ayat</i> of the Veil was revealed about Zaynab bint Jahsh. On that day we fed people with bread and meat [for the wedding feast].

'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone believes in Allah and His Messenger and establishes the prayer and fasts Ramadan, it is mandatory for Allah to admit him to the Garden, whether he emigrates in the way of Allah or sits in the land where he was born." They asked, "Messenger of Allah, shall we inform the people about that?" He said, "In the Garden there are a hundred degrees which Allah has prepared for those who do jihad in the way of Allah. Between each two degrees is the space between heaven and earth. When you ask Allah, ask Him for Firdaws which is in the middle of the Garden and the top of the Garden above the Throne of the Merciful and from it spring the rivers of the Garden."</p>
<p>	6988. Ibrahim at-Tami related from his father that Abu Dharr said, "I entered the mosque while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was seated, When the sun set, he said, 'Abu Dharr, do you know where this goes?' I answered, 'Allah and his mother knows best.' He said, 'It goes to ask permission for prostration, and it is given permission. It will be as if it is told, 'Go back from whence you came,' and it will rise from the west.' Then he recited <i>'That is a period determined for it' </i>(36:38)" in the reading of 'Abdullah [ibn Mas'ud].*</p>
<p>[<span style="color: #990099;">* instead of "runs its course for a period determined for it".]</span></p>

Ibn as-Sabaq related that Zayd ibn Thabit related to him, "Abu Bakr sent for me and I looked out the Qur'an until I found the end of <i>Surat at-Tawba </i>with Abu Khuzayma al-Ansari and I did not find it with anyone else:<i> 'A Messenger has come to you from among yourselves. ...'</i> to the end of <i>Bara'a</i> (<i>at-Tawba</i>)."</p>
<p>	Al-Layth related this from Yunus, and he said, "With Abu Khuzayma al-Ansari."</p>
<p>	6990. Abu'l-'Aliyya related that Ibn 'Abbas  said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say in times of distress, 'There is no god but Allah, the All-Knowing, Ever-Forbearing. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Immense Throne. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the Noble throne."</p>
<p>	6991. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "People will faint on the Day of Rising. Then I will see Musa holding to one of the legs of the Throne."</p>
<p>	Abu Salama related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I will be the first to be resurrected and Musa will be holding on to the Throne."</p>

<p><b>XXIII.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him"</i> (70:4) and His words, <i>"All good words rise to Him."</i> (35:10)</b></p>
<p>	Abu Jamra related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When news of the mission of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reached Abu Dharr, he said to his brother, 'Learn for me knowledge about this man who claims that information comes to him from the heaven."</p>
<p>	Mujahid said that<i> "virtuous actions" </i>(35:10) exalt good words. It is said that the meaning of<i> "the Lord of the Ascending Steps"</i> (70:3) are the angels who ascend to Allah.</p>
<p>	6992. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The angels of the night and the angels of the day alternate with you and they meet during the <i>'Asr</i> prayer and the <i>Fajr</i> prayer. Then those who have spent the night with you ascend and He asks them, while He has better knowledge of you, 'How did you leave My slaves?' They answer, 'We left them praying and came to them when they were praying.'"</p>
<p>	6993. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone gives in <i>sadaqa</i> as much as a date from honest earnings - and only good ascends to Allah - Allah will accept it in His right hand and will then increase it in size for the giver, just like one of you might rear a foal, until it is the size of a mountain."</p>
<p>	Ibn Yasar related it from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Only ascends to Allah."</p>
<p>6994. Abu'l-'Aliyya related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to use these words at times of difficulty: "There is no god but Allah, the Immense, Ever-Forgiving. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Immense throne. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the Noble Throne."</p>
<p>	6995. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "Some gold was sent to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he divided it between four people."</p>
<p>	Ibn Abi Nu'm related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "While 'Ali was in Yemen, he sent some gold ore to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he divided it between al-Aqra' ibn Habis al-Hanzali (who was then one of the Banu Mujashi'), 'Uyayna ibn Badr al-Fazari, 'Alqama ibn 'Ulatha al-'Amiri (who was then one of the Banu Kilab) and Zayd al-Khayl at-Ta'i (who was then one of the Banu Nabhan). Quraysh and the Ansar became angry and said, 'He gives to the chiefs of the people of Najd and leaves us!' The Prophet said, 'I attract their hearts.'" He said, "A man with sunken eyes, bulging forehead, thick beard, prominent cheeks, and shaved head came and said, 'Muhammad, be fearful of Allah!' The Prophet * replied, 'Who  would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? He entrusts me over the people of the earth and you do not trust me?' A man of the people asked if he could kill him Ç I think it was Khalid ibn al-Walid Ç and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade him. When the man turned away, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'From the offspring of this one will emerge a people who recite the Book of Allah, but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass through Islam like the arrow passes through game and they will kill the people of Islam and leave those who worship idols. If I were to meet them, I would kill them as 'Ad was killed.'"
</p>
<p>6996. Ibrahim at-Taymi related from his father that Abu Dharr said, "I asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about His words, <i>'And the sun runs to its resting place. '</i> (36:28) and he said, 'Its fixed course is under the throne.'"</p>


<p><b>XXIV.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Faces that Day will be radiant, gazing at their Lord."</i> (75:22-23)</b></p>

<p>	6997. Qays related that Jarir said, "We were sitting with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he looked at the moon on the night of the full moon and said, 'You will see your Lord as you see this moon. You will not be harmed by seeing Him. If you can manage not to be overwhelmed to the point of missing the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets, don't be.'"</p>
<p>	6998. Qays ibn Abi Hazim related that Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'You will see your Lord with your eyes.'"</p>
<p>	6999. Qays ibn Abi Hazim related that Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out to us on the night of the full moon and said, 'On the day of rising you will see your Lord as you see this (moon). You will not be harmed by seeing Him.'"</p>
<p>	7000. 'Ata' ibn Yazid al-Laythi related from Abu Hurayra: "Some people asked, 'Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Rising?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do you dispute with one another about seeing the moon on the night of the full moon?' 'No, Messenger of Allah,' they answered. He asked, 'Do you dispute with one another about seeing the sun when there are no clouds?' 'No, Messenger of Allah,' they answered. He said, 'You will see Him like that. On the Day of Rising He will gather people and say: "Whoever worshipped something should follow it." Those who worshipped the sun will follow the sun, those who worshipped the moon will follow the moon, and those who worshipped idols will follow the idols. Then there will remain this community along with its intercessors? Ç or hypocrites (Ibrahim was unsure). Allah will come to them and say, "I am your Lord." They will say, "This where we stay until our Lord comes to us. When our Lord comes to us, we will recognise him." Then Allah will come to them in His form which they recognise and say, "I am your Lord." They will say, "You are our Lord," and follow Him. Then the Sirat will be set up over Jahannam, and I and my community will be the first to cross it. No one will speak that day except for the Messengers and their prayer on that day will be, "O Allah, preserve us! Preserve us!"'</p>
<p>	"'In Jahannam there will be hooks like the thorns of the prickly-plant. Have you seen the prickly-plant?' They answered, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'They are like the thorns of the prickly-plant except that only Allah knows how huge they are. They will hook onto people according to their actions. Some will be destroyed by their actions and some will be lacerated or cut and then saved until the time when Allah has finished judging between the slaves and wishes to bring out of the Fire whomever He wishes by His mercy. He will command the angels to take out of the fire those who did not associate anything with Allah from among those to whom Allah wishes to show mercy from among those who testified that there was no god but Allah. They will recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration. The Fire consumes all of the child of Adam except for the mark of prostration. Those people will emerge from the Fire burned and blackened and the water of life will be poured over them and they will grow as a seed grows on the bank of a stream.</p>
<p>	"'Then Allah will finish judging between His slaves and only one man will be left, whose face will be turned towards the Fire. He will be the last of the people of the Fire to enter the Garden. He will say, "O Lord! Turn my face away from the Fire! Its wind has harmed me and its blaze has burned me." He will make whatever supplication Allah wishes for him to make. Then Allah will say, "If that is done for you, will you not ask for something else?" He will say, "No, by Your might, I will not ask for anything else!" and he will give Allah whatever pledges and promises He wishes and so Allah will turn his face away from the Fire. </p>
<p>	"'When Allah turns him to face the Garden and he sees it, he will be silent as long as Allah wills that he be silent. Then he will say, "O Lord, bring me to the door of the Garden!" Allah will say, "Did you not give me pledges and promises that you would not ever ask for anything other than what you were given? Woe to you, son of Adam! How treacherous you are!" He will say, "O Lord," and will pray to Allah until He says, "If that is granted to you, will you not ask for something else?" He will say, "No, by Your might, I will not ask for anything except it!" So he will give his Lord whatever pledge and promise he wishes. He will bring him right up to the door of the Garden.</p>
<p>	"'When he reaches the door of the Garden and the Garden is opened to him and he sees what it contains of joy and happiness, he will be silent for as long as Allah wishes him to be silent. Then he will say, "O Lord, let me enter the Garden!" Allah will say, "Did you not give pledges and promises that you would not ask for other than what you were given?" He will say, "will say, "Woe to you, son of Adam! How treacherous you are!" The man will say, "O Lord, do not make me the most wretched of Your creation!" He will continue to pray until Allah laughs at him. When He laughs at him, he will say, "Enter the Garden." When he enters it, Allah will say to him, "Wish." He will ask His lord and wish until Allah reminds to say, "Such-and-such and such-and-such," until his wishes are finished. Allah will say, "You can have that and the same again.'"</p>
<p>	'Ata' ibn Yazid said, "Abu Sa'id al-Khudri was with Abu Hurayra and did not reject any of his <i>hadith</i> until Abu Hurayra related that Allah Almighty said, 'You can have that and the same again' where upon Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, '"and ten times like it," Abu Hurayra.' Abu Hurayra said, 'I only recall him saying, "You can have that and the same again."' Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, 'I testify that I memorised the words of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  "You can have that and ten times like it.""</p>
<p>	Abu Hurayra said, "That man will be the last of the people of the Garden to enter the Garden."</p>
<p>	7001. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "We asked, 'Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Rising?' He said, 'Do you dispute with one another about seeing the sun or moon when there are no clouds.' 'No,' we answered. He said, 'You will not dispute with one another about seeing you Lord on that Day except as you disagree about seeing either of them.' Then he said, 'An announcer will make a proclamation: "Let every community follow what they used to worship." The people of the cross will go with their cross. Those with idols will go with their idols. The people of every deity will go with their deity until there only remains those who worshipped Allah, pious or impious, and the remnants of the People of the Book. Then Jahannam will be brought and presented to them as if it was a mirage. The Jews will be asked, "What were you worshipping?" They will say, "We used to worship 'Uzayr the son of God." They will be told, "You lied. Allah has not taken consort or son. What are you seeking?" They will say, "We want for You to let us drink." It will be said, "Drink." They will fall [into Hell]. Then the Christians will be asked, "What were you worshipping?" They will answer, "We used to worship the Messiah son of God." They will be told, "You lied. Allah has not taken consort or son. What are you seeking?" They will say, "We want for You to let us drink." It will be said, "Drink." They will fall [into Hell]. There will remain those who worshipped Allah, pious or impious. They will be asked, "What keeps you when all of the people have gone?' They will answer, "We parted from them (in the world) in spite of having greater need of them then. We heard an announcer proclaiming, 'Let every nation join what they used to worship.' We are waiting for our Lord." Then the Compeller will come to them in a form other than His form which they saw the first time and will say, "I am your Lord." they will answer, "You are not our Lord." None will speak to Him except for the Prophets. He will say, "Is there a sign between you and Him by which you can recognise Him?" "The shin," they will answer. He will uncover his shin* and every believer will prostrate to Him. There will remain those who used to prostrate to Allah in order to show off and for the sake of reputation. They will go to prostrate and their backs will become like a single surface. Then the bridge will be brought and placed over the Fire.'</p>
<p>[<span style="color: #990099;">*. <i>as-Saq</i>: cf. (68:42). "It is said that it means the self, and so His pure Essence will manifest itself to them." Ibn 'Abbas said that the 'shin" designates hardship in the business, as they say. 'The war stood on the shin.' when it was fierce. Or it means immense light, as is related from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari."</span>]</p>
<p>	"We asked, 'Messenger of Allah, what is the bridge?' He answered, 'A slippery surface on which there are snares and hooks, and  hard thorns, which are wide, curved thorns which are found in the Najd and are called <i>sa'dan</i>. Some of the believers will cross it like the blink of an eye, some like a flash of lightning, some like the wind, some like a fast horse or camel. Some will be saved unhurt, some will be saved with scratches, and some will fall into the fire of Hell until the last of them crosses it by being dragged. You are not stronger in entreating with me for a right which is clearly yours than the believer will be on that day in entreating with the Compeller for their brothers when they see that they are saved. They will say, "Our Lord, our brothers! They used to pray with us, fast with us and act with us." Allah Almighty will say, "Go and bring out whoever you find who has the weight of a dinar of faith in his heart." Allah will forbid the Fire to burn their faces. They will go to them and some of them will be in the Fire up to their feet and some up to the middle of their legs. They will bring out those they recognise and then return and Allah will say, "Go and bring out whoever you find who has the weight of a half a dinar of faith in his heart." They will bring out those they recognise and then return and Allah will say, "Go and bring out whoever you find who has the weight of an atom of faith in his heart." They will bring out those they recognise.'"</p>
<p>	Abu Sa'id said, "If you do not believe me, then recite, <i>'Allah does not wrong anyone by so much as the smallest speck. And if there is a good deed Allah will multiply it .'</i> (4:40)"</p>
<p>	[He continued,] "'The Prophets, angels and believers will intercede, and the Compeller will say, "My intercession remains." He will take a handful from the Fire and bring out people who have been burnt and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of the Garden which is called the Water of Life. They will grow on its banks as a seed grows on the scum of the torrent. You have seen them beside a rock or beside a tree, and the side which faces the sun is green and that which faces the shade is white. They will come out of it like pearls and there will be rings? on their necks. They will enter the Garden and the people of the Garden will say, "These are those set free by the All-Merciful, He admitted them to the Garden without them having done any good actions or sending forward any good. It will be said to them, "You will have what you have seen and the same again."'"
</p>
<p>	7002. Qatada related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The believers will be kept on the Day of Rising until they become worried about that. They will say, 'If only we could ask someone to intercede for us to give us relief from our position!' They will go to Adam and say, 'You are the father of mankind. Allah created you with His hand. Let you dwell in His garden, made His angels prostate to you and taught you the names of all things. Will you intercede on our behalf with your Lord so that He will relieve us from this place of ours?' He will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mention his error which he committed: eating from the tree when he was forbidden it. 'Rather go to Nuh, the first Messenger that Allah sent to the people of the earth.' They will go to Nuh and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mention his error which he committed in asking his Lord for that of which he had no knowledge. 'Rather go to Ibrahim, the Close Friend of the all-Merciful.' They will go to Ibrahim and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mention the three statements in which he lied. 'Go to Musa, a slave to whom He gave the Torah, to whom Allah spoke directly and brought near for conversation' They will go to Musa and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mention his error which he committed when he killed a person. 'Rather go to 'Isa, the slave of Allah and His Messenger, the Spirit of Allah and His Word. They will go to 'Isa and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task. Rather go to Muhammad, a slave whose past and future wrong actions Allah has forgiven.' They will come to me and I will ask for my Lord's permission to enter His House and He will give me permission. When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration and He will leave me as long as Allah wills. Then He will say, 'Muhammad, rise. Speak and it will be heard. Intercede and the intercession will be granted. Ask and you will be given.'"</p>
<p>	He said, "I will lift my head and praise Him with praises which He will teach me. He will fix an amount for me and I will bring them out and let them into the Garden."</p>
<p>	Qatada said, "I also heard him say that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I will go out and bring them out of the Fire and admit them into the Garden. Then I will ask my Lord for permission to enter His house and I will be given permission. When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration and He will leave me as long as Allah wills. Then He will say, "Muhammad, rise. Speak and it will be heard. Intercede and the intercession will be granted. Ask and you will be given." I will lift my head and praise Him with praises which He will teach me. He will fix an amount for me and I will bring them out and let them into the Garden.'"</p>
<p>	Qatada said, "I also heard him say that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I will go out and bring them out of the Fire and admit them into the Garden. Then I will return a third time and I will ask my Lord for permission to enter His house and I will be given permission. When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration and He will leave me as long as Allah wills. Then He will say, "Muhammad, rise. Speak and it will be heard. Intercede and the intercession will be granted. Ask and you will be given." I will lift my head and praise Him with praises which He will teach me. He will fix an amount for me and I will bring them out and let them into the Garden.'"</p>
<p>	Qatada said, "I also heard him say that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I will go out and bring them out of the Fire and admit them into the Garden until only those remain in the Fire whom the Qur'an has held," i.e. for whom eternity is obliged. He said, "Then he recited this <i>ayat</i>, <i>'It may well be that your Lord will raise you to a Praiseworthy Station.'</i> (17:79)." He said, "This is the Praiseworthy Station which He promised your Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
</p>
<p>	7003. Ibn Shihab said that Anas ibn Malik related to him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent for the Ansar and gathered them in a tent and then said to them, "Be steadfast until you meet Allah and His Messenger. I will be at the Basin."
</p>
<p>	7004. Sulayman al-Ahwal reported that Tawus related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did <i>tahajjud</i> at night, he would say, 'O Allah, praise is Yours. You are the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and everyone in them. Praise is Yours. You are the light of the heavens and the earth and everyone in them. You are the Truth. Your promise is true. The meeting with You is true. The Garden is true and the Fire is true. The Hour is true. O Allah, I have submitted to You, I have believed in You, and I have put my trust in You. I argue by You and take You as arbitrator. Forgive me my past and future wrong actions and what I keep secret and what I make known, and what You know better than I. There is no god but You.'"</p>
<p>	Abu 'Abdullah [al-Bukhari] said that Qays ibn Sa'd and Abu'z-Zubayr relate "<i>qayyím</i>" (Sustainer) rather than<i> "qayyim"</i> from Tawus. Mujahid said that <i>Qayyum</i> is the one who sustains all things. 'Umar recited recited qayyím, and both words are praise.</p>

Abu Wa'il related from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "if anyone swears a false oath in order to take the property of a man by it, he will meet Allah with anger covering him."

<p>7008. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are three people that Allah will not speak to nor look at on the Day of Rising: a man who swears that he has been offered more for his goods than he has been offered and is lying, a man who swears a false oath after  <i>'Asr</i> in order to get the property of another Muslim man and a man who withholds excess water. Allah will say, 'Today I will withhold My bounty as you withheld the bounty of something that was not the work of your hands.'"</p>
<p>	7009. The son of Abu Bakra related from Abu Bakra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Time has continued cyclically in the same way since the day Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred. Three are consecutive: Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l-Hijja and al-Muharram, and there is Rajab of Mudar which is between Jumada and Sha'ban. What month is this?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He was silent so that we thought that he might call it something different. He said, "Is this not Dhu'l-Hijja?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "What town is this?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He was silent so that we thought that he might call it something different. He said, "Is this not the town?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "What day is this?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He was silent so that we thought that he might call it something different. He said, "Is this not the Day of Sacrifice?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "Your blood and your property [Muhammad said, "And I think that he also said, 'your honour"] are sacred to you, like the sacredness of this day in this month in this place. You will meet your Lord and He will ask you about your actions. So do not revert to misguidance after I have gone, cutting each other's throats. Let those who are present convey to those who are absent. Perhaps the one to whom it is conveyed will retain it better than those who heard it." [When Muhammad mentioned it, he used to say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, spoke the truth."] Then he said, "Have I not conveyed it? Have I not conveyed it?"

Everything has a fixed term with Him, so she should show fortitude and expect a reward.' She sent to him adjuring him to come to her. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up and I got up with him, as did Mu'adh ibn Jabal. Ubayy ibn 'Ubada and 'Ubada ibn as-Samit. When he entered, they handed the child to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was shuddering. (I think he said, "Like an old waterskin.")

Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Garden and the Fire argued before their Lord, and the Garden said, 'O Lord, what does it have?

'You are My mercy' and He said to the Fire. 'You are My punishment by which I punish whomever I wish. Each of you will have its fill.'" He said, "As for the garden, Allah will not wrong any of His creatures. He creates for the Fire whomever He wishes, and they will be thrown into it. It will say, 'Are there any more?' three times until He places His foot in it and it is filled and its parts come together and it says, 'Enough! Enough! Enough!'"</p>

Qatada related that Anas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Some people will be burned by the Fire as a punishment for sins which they committed and then Allah will admit them to the Garden by the grace of His mercy.

Then He will say with His hand, "I am the King." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughed and said,<i> 'They do not measure Allah with His true measure.'</i>(39:67)"
</p>

<p><b>XXVII. What has come about the creation of the heavens and the earth and other creatures</b></p>
<p>	That is the action of the Lord - Blessed is He and exalted - and His command [by saying "Be!"]. He is the Lord with His attributes, action and command, and He is the Creator and Fashioner who is not created.

The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, spoke to his wife awhile and then lay down. In the last third Ç or part Ç of the night, he sat up, looked at the sky and recited,<i> 'In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, there are Signs for people with intelligence.'</i> (3:190) Then he got up, did <i>wudu' </i>and cleaned his teeth and then prayed eleven <i>rak'ats</i>.

Then an angel is sent to it and told to write four things: he writes down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy. Then the spirit is breathed into him. So one of you can do the actions of someone destined for the Garden until there is only an armspan between him and it, and then what is written will overtake him and he will do the actions of someone destined for the Fire and will enter the Fire. A man among you can do the actions of someone destined for the Fire until there is only an armspan between him and it, and then what is written will overtake him and he will do the actions of someone destined for the Garden and when enter it.'"</p>

He passed by a group of Jews. One of them said to another, 'Ask him about the Spirit.' Another said, 'Do not ask him about the Spirit.' They asked him and he stood, leaning on the staff while I was with him. I thought that he was receiving revelation. He then said, <i>'They will ask you about the Ruh.

<p><i>	"Your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then settled Himself firmly on the Throne.

Salim ibn 'Abdullah related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say while he was standing on the minbar, "What is left for you in relation to the nations before you is like what is between the <i>'Asr</i> prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah were given the Torah and acted by it until midday and then were unable to work further and were given a qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and acted by it until the <i>'Asr </i>prayer and then were unable to work further and were given a qirat each. Then you were given the Qur'an and you acted by it until sunset and you were given two qirats each. The people of the Torah said, 'Our Lord, those people did less work than us but received a greater wage!' He said, 'Have I wronged you at all regarding your wage?"

Any among you who fulfil this will be rewarded by Allah. Any who does any of these things and are punished in this world, that will be an expiation and purification for him. If Allah conceals it, then it will be up to Allah. If He wishes, He will punish him, and if He wishes, He will forgive him.'"</p>

At that, the Muslim raised his hand and slapped the Jew. The Jew went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told him about what had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not prefer me over Musa. On the Day of Rising, people will faint, and I will be the first to regain consciousness, and there will be Musa grasping the Throne.

Then Ibn Abi Quhafa [Abu Bakr] took I and drew one or two buckets, and there was some weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him! Then 'Umar took it and it turned into a large bucket. I have not seen a leader among the people work so well as he did until the people watered their camels."</p>
<p>	7038. Abu Burda related that Abu Musa said, "When a begger came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, (and perhaps he said, "An asker or someone with an need came"), he would say, 'Intercede and you will be rewarded.

Did you hear the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mention his business?" Ubayy said, "Yes, I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'While Musa was in a gathering of the tribe of Israel, a man came to him and said, "Do you know of anyone who has more knowledge than you?" Musa replied, "No." Then Allah revealed to Musa, "Indeed, Our slave Khidr has." Musa asked the way to find him and Allah gave him the fish as a sign and told Musa, "Wherever you lose the fish, you should return to that place and you will find Khidr there." Musa followed the track of the fish into the sea. Then Musa's servant said to him, (("What do you think? When we took refuge in the rock, then I forgot the fish - and it was Shaytan that made me forget it so that I should not remember it." [Musa said,] "This is what we were seeking!" So they doubled back on their tracks, retracing them.)) Then they found Khidr. [What happened further] Allah relates their affair in His Book.'"</p>

Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said [in the Farewell <i>Hajj</i>], "Allah willing, tomorrow we will camp at Khayf Bani Kinana where they [Quraysh] took oaths from one another in unbelief,"* meaning al-Muhassab.</p>

	He, exalted is He, says, <i>"Who can intercede with Him except by His permission?"</i> (2:255)
<p>	Masruq said that Ibn Mas'ud said, "When Allah speaks the revelation, the people of the heavens hear something and when the fear leaves their hearts and the voice is still, they recognise that it is the truth and call on one another saying,<i> 'What did your Lord say?'

Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When Allah loves a slave, He calls out to Jibril, 'Allah loves so-and-so, so love him!' and Jibril loves him. Then Jibril calls out in heaven, 'Allah loves so-and-so, so love him!' and the people of heaven love him. Then acceptance is placed in the people of the earth for him."</p>

<p>	7050. Abu Ishaq al-Hamdani related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "So-and-so, when you go to your bed, say, 'O Allah, I have surrendered myself to You, turned my face to You, entrusted my affair to You and relied on You in hope and fear of You. There is no refuge nor rescue from You except in You. I have believed in Your Book which You sent down and in Your Prophet whom You sent.' If you die that night, then you will be in a state of pure human nature. If you awake in the morning, You will receive a reward.'"</p>

When he led his Companions in prayer, he would raise his voice when reciting the Qur'an. When the idolaters heard him, they would abuse the Qur'an, the One who revealed it and the one who brought it. So Allah Almighty said to His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, <i>'Do not be too loud in your  prayer,'</i> meaning 'in your recitation,' so that the idolaters will hear and abuse the Qur'an, <i>'or too quiet in it,'</i> so that your companions do not hear. <i>'But try to find a way between the two'</i> (17:110) so that they hear it but do not be loud so that they take the Qur'an from you."

You are the Light of the heavens and the earth. Yours is the praise. You are the upholder of the heavens and the earth. Yours is the praise. You are the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everyone in them. Yours is the praise. You are the Truth. Your promise is true. Your word is true. The meeting with You is true. The Garden is true and the Fire is true. The Prophets are true and the Hour is true. O Allah, I have submitted to You and I have believed in You. In You I have put my trust and to You I turn. I argue by You and take You as arbitrator. Forgive me my past and future wrong actions and what I keep secret and what I make known. You are my God. There is no god but You.'"</p>

Each related to me part of the <i>hadith</i> which they related to me. 'A'isha said, "However, by Allah, I did not think that any revelation would be sent down regarding me. I thought too little of myself that something would be said in the Qur'an regarding me, however I hoped that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would have a dream in which Allah would exonerate me. Then Allah Almighty revealed the ten verses which begin<i> 'There is a group of you who propagated the lie. . . .'</i> (24:11)"</p>
<p>	7062. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah says, 'When My slave intends to perform a bad action, do not write it against him until he actually does it. If he does it, then write its like. If he does not do it for My sake, then write it as a good action for him. If he wants to perform a good action and does not actally do it, then write it for him as a good action. If he does it, then write it for him from ten like it to seven hundred times more.</p>
<p>	7063. Sa'id ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty created creation and when he finished creating, kinship stood up.

Allah then said, 'Are you not content that I maintain connection with those who maintain your ties and I cut off those who cut you off?' It said, 'Yes indeed, my Lord!' Then He said, 'You have that.'" Then Abu Hurayra recited, <i>"Is it not likely that, if you did turn away, you would cause corruption in the earth and sever your ties of kinship?"</i> (47:22)</p>

[He said,] 'By Allah, if Allah were to have power over him, He would inflict on him a punishment which He would not inflict on anyone in the world.' Allah ordered the sea to collect what it contained of him and ordered the land to collect what was in it of him. Then He asked, 'Why did you do it?' He answered, 'Out of fear of You, and You know best." So He forgave him."</p>
<p>	7068. 'Abdullah ibn Abi 'Amra was heard to say that he heard Abu Hurayra say that he heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Someone did (or committed) a wrong action and said, 'O Lord, I have sinned (or committed), so forgive me!' His Lord said, 'Does My slave acknowledge that he has a Lord who forgives wrong action and punishes for it? I have forgiven My slave.' Then he remained for as long as Allah wished and then again committed (or did) a wrong action and said, 'O Lord, I have sinned (or committed) again, forgive it.' He said, 'Does My slave acknowledge that he has a Lord who forgives wrong action and punishes for it? I have forgiven My slave.' Then he remained for as long as Allah wished and then committed a wrong action and said, 'O Lord, I have committed (or done) another wrong action, so forgive me.' Allah said, 'Does My slave acknowledge that he has a Lord who forgives wrong action and punishes for it? I have forgiven My slave,' three times, 'so let him do what he likes.'"</p>
<p>	7069. 'Uqba ibn 'Abdu'l-Ghafir related from Abu Sa'id that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned a man from those in the past or about those before you and he said some words which mean: Allah gave him wealth and children and when he was close to death, he asked his sons, 'What sort of a father have I been to you?" "The best father," they replied. He said that he had not done any good deed (or not done any good) with Allah and if Allah were to have power over him, He would punish him. [He said,] "Wait until I die and then burn me until I become coals and then crush me (or pulverise me). When there is a windy day, scatter me in it.'" The Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "He made them firmly promise to do that. By My Lord, they did it and then scattered him on a stormy day. Allah - Exalted and Majestic is He, said, Be!' and he was a man standing there. Allah said, 'O My slave, what made you do what you did?'" He answered, 'Fear of You," (or "being afraid of You.") He said, Nothing saved other than the fact that He showed mercy to him at that." He said another time, "Nothing but that saved him." [Sulayman at-Taymi said,] "I related it to Abu 'Uthman and he said, 'I heard this from Salman [al-Farisi], although he added, 'Scatter me over the sea,' or words to that effect.'"</p>
<p>	7070. Musa said that Mu'tamir related <i>"lam yabta'ir"</i>. Khalifa said that Mu'tamir related, <i>"lam yabta'iz."</i> Qatada explained that it means, "did not store up".</p>

<p><b>XXXVI.  The words of Allah Almighty on the Day of Rising with the Prophets and others</b></p>
<p>	7071. Humayd said, "I heard Anas say, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "On the Day of Rising I will be granted intercession and I will say, 'O Lord, admit to the Garden whoever has the weight of a grain of mustard-seed of belief in his heart!' and they will enter it. Then I will say, 'Admit to the Garden whoever has the least amount of faith in his heart!'"' Anas said, 'It is as if I could see the fingers of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"</p>
<p>	7072. Ma'bad ibn Hilal al-'Anzi related, "We, some of the people of Basra, met and went to Anas ibn Malik, and we took with us Thabit al-Bunani so that he could ask him about the hadith of intercession on our behalf. Anas was in his castle and we found him praying Duha. We asked for permission to enter and were given permission. He was sitting on his carpet. We said to Thabit, 'Do not ask him about anything first except the hadith of intercession." So he said, 'Abu Hamza! These are your brothers from the people of Basra. They have come to you to ask you about the hadith of intercession.' Anas said, 'Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, related to us, "On the Day of Rising, people will surge into one another. They will go to Adam and say, 'Intercede with your Lord for us.' He will answer, 'I am not worthy of this. You should go to Ibrahim. He is the Close Friend of the all-Merciful.' They will go to Ibrahim and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this. You should go to Musa. He is the one to whom Allah spoke.' They will go to Musa and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this. You should go to 'Isa. he is the Spirit of Allah and His word.' they will go to 'Isa and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this. You should to Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." They will come to me and I will say, 'I will do it.' I will ask permission from my Lord and permission will be given to me. He will inspire me with praises with which I will praise Him which I do not know now. I will praise Him with that praise and fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, 'Muhammad, raise your head and speak and you will be heard. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and intercession will be granted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my community! My community!' It will be said, 'Go and remove from it all of those who have the weight of a grain of barley of belief in their hearts.' I will go and do that and then I will return and praise Him with that praise and then fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, 'Muhammad, raise your head and speak and you will be heard. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and intercession will be granted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my community! My community!' It will be said, 'Go and remove from it all of those who have the weight of a small ant or grain of mustard-seed of belief in their hearts.' I will go and do that and then I will return and praise Him with that praise and then fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, 'Muhammad, raise your head and speak and you will be heard. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and intercession will be granted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my community! My community!' It will be said, 'Go and remove from the Fire all of those who have the weight of faith of the slightest slightest mustard seed.'"'</p>
<p>	"When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions, 'We should go by al-Hasan who is hiding in the house of Abu Khalifa and he can relate to us what Anas ibn Malik related to us.' We went to him and greeted him and he gave us permission to enter. We told him, "Abu Sa'id, we have come from your brother, Anas ibn Malik, and we have not seen the like of what he related to us abut intercession.' He said, 'What is it?' We related the <i>hadith</i> to him. He stopped at this point and he said, 'Go on!' We said, 'He did not give us more than this.' He said, 'He related all of it to me twenty years ago. I do not know whether he has forgotten or disliked for you to rely on it.' We said, 'Abu Sa'id, relate it to us!' He laughed and said, 'Man was created in haste. I only mentioned it because I want to relate to you. He related to me the same as what he related to you and he said, "Then I will go back a fourth time and I praise Him with that praise and then fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, 'Muhammad, raise your head and speak and you will be heard. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and intercession will be granted.' I will say, 'O Lord give me permission for those who said, "There is no god but Allah." He will say, 'By My might, majesty, pride and immensity, I will bring out of it those who said, 'There is no god but Allah."'"</p>
<p>	7073. 'Abida related from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The last of the people to enter the Garden and the last of the people to leave the Fire will be a man who will emerge crawling and his Lord will tell him, 'Enter the Garden.' He will say, 'Lord, the garden is full!' He will say that to him several times and each time he will reply, 'The Garden is full.' He will say, 'You will have the like of this world ten times over.'"</p>
<p>	7074. Khaythama related from 'Adi ibn Hatim that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is none among you but that his Lord will speak to him without any interpreter between Him and him. He will look to his right and see nothing but the actions he advanced and will look to his left and see nothing but the actions he advanced. He will look in front of him and see nothing but the Fire facing him. Protect yourselves from the Fire, even if only with half a date."</p>
<p>	Al-A'mash said that 'Amr ibn Murra related the like of it from Khaythama and added, "even if only with a good word."</p>
<p>	7075. 'Abida related that 'Abdullah said, "One of the rabbis came and said, 'On the Day of Rising, Allah will put the heavens on one finger, the earths on one finger, the water and dust on one finger, and the rest of creation on one finger, and shake them. Then He will say, "I am the King. I am the King."' I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laugh until his molars showed out of wonder and to affirm what he said. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited, <i>'They do not measure Allah with His true measure. The whole earth will be a mere handful for Him on the Day of Rising, the heavens folded up in His right hand. Glory be to Him! He is exalted above the partners they ascribe!'</i> (39:67)"</p>
<p>	7076. Qatada related from Safwan ibn Muhriz that a man asked Ibn 'Umar, "What did you hear the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say about secret conversation (<i>najwa</i>)?" He answered, "One of you will draw near to his Lord until He puts His cover over him and He will ask, 'Did you do such-and-such?' He will answer, 'Yes.'  He will ask 'Did you do such-and-such?' He will answer, 'Yes.' He will admit all that and then He will say, 'I veiled you in this world and today I forgive you for it.'" </p>
<p>	Safwan related from Ibn 'Umar, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."</p>


<p><b>XXXVII.  His words, <i>"And Allah spoke directly to Musa." </i>(4:164)</b></p>

<p>	7077. Humayd ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Adam and Musa argued, and Musa said to him, 'You are Adam whom expelled your descendants from the Garden.'  Adam said, 'You are Musa whom Allah chose for His messages and direct words and then you blame me for something which was decreed for me before I was created? So Adam overcame Musa in the argument."</p>
<p>	7078. Qatada related from Anas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The believers will be gathered on the Day of Rising and will say,' We should look for someone to intercede with our Lord to relieve us from this place where we are!' They will go to Adam and say, "You are the Adam, the father of mankind. Allah created you with His won hand, the angels prostrated to you and He taught you the names of all things. Intercede on our behalf with your Lord to relieve us from this place where we are!" He will say, " 'I am not worthy of this task," and he will mention his error he committed.'"</p>
<p>	7079. Sharik ibn 'Abdullah related that he heard Anas ibn Malik say, "On the night when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, travelled from the Mosque of the Ka'ba, three people came to him while he was sleeping in the Masjid al-Haram before he received the revelation. The first of them asked, 'Which of them is he?' The middle one said, 'He is the best of them.' The last of them said, 'Take the best of them.' On that night he did not see them until they came to him on another night in which his heart saw while his eyes were asleep. His heart does not sleep. That is how it is with the Prophets: their eyes sleep but their hearts do not sleep.</p>
<p>	"They did not speak to him until they carried him and placed him at the well of Zamzam and then from among them Jibril took charge of him. Jibril split him open between his throat and the middle of his chest and emptied out his breast and abdomen and then washed it with Zamzam water so that he cleansed his abdomen. Then a tray was brought which contained a gold vessel filled with faith and wisdom. He stuffed it into his breast and blood vessels, i.e. the veins of his throat, and then he closed it and ascended with him to the lowest heaven. He knocked on one of its doors and the people of the heaven called out, 'Who is this?' 'Jibril.' he answered. They said, 'Who is with you?' He replied. 'Muhammad is with me.' He said, 'Has he been sent for?' 'Yes,' he answered. They said, 'Welcome!' The people of the heaven rejoice at him. The people of heaven do not know what Allah wants of him on the earth until He informs them.</p>
<p>	"He will find Adam in the lowest heaven. Jibril will tell him, 'This is your father Adam, so greet him.' He greeted him and Adam returned the greeting and said, 'Welcome to my son! And an excellent son you are!' There in the lowest heaven are two flowing rivers and he asked, 'What are these two rivers, Jibril?' He replied, 'This is the sources of the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then he took him around the heaven and there was another river on which was a castle of pearls and emeralds. He put his hand into it and it was very fine musk. He asked, 'What is this, Jibril?' He replied, 'This is Kawthar which your Lord has stored up for you.'</p>
<p>	"Then he took him up to the second heaven and the angels said to him the like of what those in the first had said, 'Who is this?' He answered, 'Jibril.' They asked, 'Who is with you?' He replied. 'Muhammad is with me.' They said, 'Has he been sent for?' 'Yes,' he answered. They said, 'Welcome!' Then he took him to the third heaven and they said to him the like of what those in the first and second had said. Then he took him to the fourth and they said the like of that. Then he took him to the fifth heaven and they said the like of that. Then he took him to the sixth heaven and they said the like of that and then he took him to the seventh heaven and they said the like of that.</p>
<p>	"Each heaven contained Prophets which he named. I recall of them that Idris was in the second, Harun in the fourth, another whose name I do not recall in the fifth, Ibrahim in the sixth, and Musa in the seventh because of the virtue of speaking directly to Allah. Musa said, "Lord, I did not think that You would elevate anyone above me!' Then Jibril ascended with him above that as only Allah knows until he reached the Lote-Tree of the Boundary and the Compeller, the Lord of Might approached and descended until he was the distance of two bow spans from him or nearer. </p>
<p>	"Part of what Allah revealed to him was 'Fifty prayers for your community every day and night.' Then he descended until he met Musa who stopped him and said, 'Muhammad, what did your Lord contract with you?' He answered, 'He contracted with me fifty prayers every day and night.' He said, 'Your community will not be able to do that. Go back and ask your Lord to lighten it for you and for them.' The Prophet * turned to Jibril as if he wished to consult him about that and Jibril indicated to him, "Yes, if you wish.' So he ascended to the Compeller and said while he was in his place, 'O Lord, lighten it for us. My community will not be able to do this!' He reduced it by ten prayers. Then he returned to Musa who stopped him, and Musa continued to send him back to his Lord until it was five prayers. Then Musa stopped him the fifth time and said, 'Muhammad, I tried as hard as I could with the tribe of Israel, my people, with less than this and they were weak and abandoned it.  Your community has weaker bodies, hearts, physique, seeing and hearing. Go back and ask your Lord to lighten it for you.' Every time the Prophet turned to Jibril so that he could advise him and Jibril did not dislike that. So he took him up for the fifth time and he said, 'O Lord, my community are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and physique, so lighten that for us.' The Compeller said, 'Muhammad!' 'At Your service!' he replied. He said, 'The Word with Me does not change and it is as I obliged on you in the Mother of the Book.' He said, 'Every good action is worth ten like it and so it is fifty in the Mother of the Book while it is five for you.' He returned to Musa who asked, 'How did you do?' He said, 'He lightened it for us and gave us ten for every good action.' Musa said, 'By Allah, I tried as hard as I could with the tribe of Israel with less than this and they abandoned it. Return to your Lord and ask him to lighten it for you more.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Musa, by Allah, I am embarrassed by the number of times I was returned to my Lord.' He said, 'descend in the Name of Allah.'" He said, "He woke up and he was in the Masjid al-Haram."</p>


<p><b>XXXVIII.  The words of the Lord with the people of the Garden</b></p>

<p>	7080. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah will say to the people of the Garden, 'People of the Garden!' and they will answer, 'At Your service, and good is in Your hand.' He will ask, 'Are you pleased?' They will answer, 'How could we not be pleased, Lord? You have given us what You have not given any of Your creation.' He will say, 'Shall I not give you better than that?' They will say, 'O Lord, what is better than that?' He will say, 'I will allow you My pleasure and I will never be angry with You after it.'"</p>
<p>	7081. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was speaking one day whole a man of the desert bedouins was with him. The Prophet said, "A man of the people of the Garden will ask for Allah's permission to cultivate. He will say to him, 'Are you not in that which you wish?' He will reply, 'Yes, indeed, but I want to cultivate.' He will hurry and sow, and its plants will appear immediately and be upright and harvested and piled in heaps like mountains. Allah Almighty will say, 'Here you are, son of Adam. Nothing satisfies you." The bedouin said, "Allah, this one must only be from Quraysh or the Ansar. They are the people of crops. As for us, we are not people of crops." The Messenger of Allah  laughed.</p>


<p><b>XXXIX.  Allah remembers by the command and His slaves remember of supplication, humble entreaty, the Message, and conveying</b></p>
<p>	This is based on His words, <i>"Remember Me and I will remember you."</i> (2:152)<i> "Recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his people, 'My people, if my standing here and reminding you of Allah's Signs has become too much for you to bear, know that I have put my trust in Allah. So decide, you and your gods, on what you want to do and be open about it. Do with me whatever you decide and do not keep me waiting. If you turn your backs, I have not asked you for any wage. My wage is the responsibility of Allah alone. I am commanded to be one of the Muslims.'</i>" (10:71-72)</p>
<p>	<i>Ghumma</i> (hard on you) means "worry and constriction".</p>
<p>	Mujahid said about<i> "If any of the idolaters ask you for protection, give them protection until they have heard the words of Allah"</i> (9:6) that when someone comes to him to hear what he says and what was revealed to him, he is safe when he comes to listen to the words of Allah and until he reaches his place of safety from which he came. <i>"The momentous  news"</i> (78:2) is the Qur'an. "<i>Sawab</i>" (right) (78:38) is true in this world and acted upon.</p>


<p><b>XL.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Do not, then, knowingly make others equal to Allah."</i> (2:22)</b></p>
<p>	And His words, <i>"Do you make others equal to Him? That is the Lord of all the worlds."</i> (41:9)</p>
<p>	And His words, <i>"Those who do not call on any other god together with Allah ." </i>(25:68)</p>
<p>	And He said, <i>"It has been revealed to you and those before you:  'If you associate others with Allah, your actions will come to nothing and you will be among the losers.' No! Worship Allah and be among the thankful.</i>" (39:65-66)</p>
<p>	'Ikrima said, <i>"Most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others with Him."</i> (12:106) <i>"If you asked them who created them"</i> (43:87) and <i>"If you ask them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' they will say, 'Allah.'"</i> (39:38) That is their faith, yet they worship other than Him."</p>
<p><b>What is mentioned about the creation of the actions of people and their earnings by the words of the Almighty, <i>"He created everything and determined it most exactly."</i> (25:2)</b></p>
<p>	Mujahid said that <i>"The angels only descend with the truth "</i> (15:8)* means with the Message and the punishment, and <i>"So that He would be able to question the truly sincere about their sincerity"</i> (33:8) means the Messengers who convey and perform. <i>"And We will preserve it"</i> (15:9) means "with Us." <i>"And he who brings the Truth,"</i> which is the Qur'an, <i>"those who confirm it "</i> (39:33) means the believers.

<p>	7082. 'Amr ibn Shurahbil related that 'Abdullah said, "I asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Which is the greatest sin in the eyes of Allah?' He said, 'That you set up a rival with Allah when He created you.' I said, 'That is indeed terrible.' I said, 'Then what?' He said, 'That you kill your child fearing that he will eat with you.' I said, 'Then what?' He said, 'That you fornicate with your neighbour's wife.'"</p>

<p><b>XLI. The words of Allah Almighty,<i> "You did not think to shield yourselves from your hearing, sight and skin testifying against you and you thought that Allah would never know much of what you did."</i> (41:22)</b></p>

<p>	7083. Abu Ma'mar related that 'Abdullah said, "Two men of Thaqif and a Qurayshi, or two Qurayshis and a Thaqifi, with fat bellies and little understanding in their heats, met at the House. One of them said, 'Do you think that Allah hears what we say?' The other said, 'He hears us if we speak aloud and does not hear us if we speak secretly.' The third said, 'If He hears us when we speak aloud, then He hears us when we conceal,' So Allah Almighty revealed, "You did not think to shield yourselves from your hearing, sight and skin testifying against you.' (41:22)"</p>


<p><b>XLII. The words of Allah Almighty, <i>" Every day He is engaged in some affair."</i> (55:29)</b></p>
<p>	<i>"No fresh reminder comes to them from their Lord without their listening to it as if it was a game"</i> (21:2) and the Almighty says, <i>"It may well be that after that Allah will cause a new situation to develop."</i> (65:1)</p>
<p><b>His bringing it about does not resemble the bringing about done by creatures by His words, <i>"Nothing is like Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing."</i> (42:11)</b></p>
<p>	Ibn Mas'ud said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah introduces from His command whatever He wishes. Part of what He introduced is that you would not speak in the prayer."</p>
<p>	7084. 'Ikrima related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "How can you ask the people of the Book about their Books when you have the Book of Allah, the most recent of Books from Allah, which you recite pure and unsullied?"</p>
<p>	7085. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said, "Company of Muslims, how can you ask the People of the Book about anything when your book which was sent down on His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is the most recent of the reports by Allah, pure and unsullied. Allah has reported to you that the People of the Book have altered and changed the Books of Allah and they wrote it with their own hands and then said, 'It is from Allah' in order to sell it for a small price. Does not the knowledge that has come to you prevent you from asking them? No, by Allah, we have not seen a man among them asking you about what was revealed to you!'"
</p>
<p><b>XLIII.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Do not move your tongue trying to hasten it. "</i> (75:16) and what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did when the revelation was sent down on him.</b></p>

<p>	Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty said, 'I am with My slave whenever he remembers Me and whenever his lips move with My remembrance."</p>
<p>	7086. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related from Ibn 'Abbas about His words, <i>"Do not move your tongue trying to hasten it" </i>(75:16), "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to experience hardship while receiving the revelation and he used to move his lips [for committing it into memory instantly]." Ibn 'Abbas said to me, "I am moving my lips for you as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, moved his." Sa'id said, "I am moving my lips as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his," and he moved his lips. So Allah the Almighty sent down, <i>'Do not move your tongue trying to hasten it Its collection and recitation are Our affair.'</i> He said that 'collecting it' is in your heart and then your reciting it [as it was revealed]. <i>'So when We recite it, follow its recitation,'</i> means listen to it and be silent. Then it is up to Us to make you recite it. After that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would listen when Jibril came to him. When Jibril left, then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would recite it as Jibril had recited it."</p>

<p><b>XLIV. The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Whether you keep your words secret or say them out loud He knows what the heart contains. Does He who created not then know? He is the All-Pervading, the All-Aware."</i> (67:13-14)</b></p>
<p>	<i>Yatakhatafuna</i> (20:103) and (68:23) is to converse secretly.</p>
<p>	7087. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related from Ibn 'Abbas  about the words of the Almighty, <i>"Do not be too loud in your prayer or too quiet in it"</i> (17:110): "This was revealed while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in hiding in Makka. When he led his Companions in prayer, he would raise his voice when reciting the Qur'an. When the idolaters heard him, they would abuse the Qur'an, the One who revealed it and the one who brought it. So Allah Almighty said to His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, <i>'Do not be too loud in your prayer,'</i> meaning 'your recitation,' so that the idolaters will hear and abuse the Qur'an,<i> 'or too quiet in it,'</i> so that your companions do not hear. '<i>But try to find a way between the two.' </i>(17:110)"</p>
<p>	7088. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "This <i>ayat</i>,<i> 'Do not be too loud in your prayer or too quiet in it'</i> (17:110), was revealed about supplication."</p>
<p>	7089. Abu Salama related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The one who does not intone the Qur'an aloud is not one of us." Someone else added, "Recite it aloud."</p>

<p><b>XLV.  The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "There is a man whom Allah has given the knowledge of the Qur'an and he stands to prayer with it throughout the night and the day. Another man says, "If I had been given what this man has been given, I would do the same as he is doing."</b></p>
<p>	Allah explained that his 'standing' with the Book means his action.</p>
<p>	Allah says,<i> "Among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and the variety of your languages and colours" </i>(30:22), and Allah says, <i>"Do good, so that hopefully you will be successful."</i> (22:77)</p>
<p>	7090. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, You can only have envy for two things: a man whom Allah has taught the Qur'an and he recites it throughout the night and throughout the day. One says, 'Would that I had been given the like of what so-and-so has been given so that I could do the like of what he does!' And there is a man to whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it properly and so one says, 'Would that I had been given the like of what so-and-so has been given so that I could do the like of what he does!'"</p>
<p>	7091. Salim related from his father that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, '"There is only envy for two things: for a man to whom Allah has given the Book of Allah and he recites it throughout the night and throughout the day, and for a man to whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it throughout the night and the day."</p>
<p>	I heard Sufyan say several times, "I did not hear him mention the report, but it is part of his sound <i>hadith</i>."</p>

<p><b>XLVI.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Messenger! transmit what has been sent down to you from your Lord. If you do not do it you will not have transmitted His Message."</i> (5:67)</b></p>
<p>	Az-Zuhri said, "The Message is from Allah and it is for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to convey and for us to submit."</p>
<p>	Allah Almighty says,<i> "So that He may know that they have indeed transmitted the Messages of their Lord."</i> (72:28) and the Almighty says, <i>"I am transmitting my Lord's Message to you ."</i> (7:62, 68)</p>
<p>	When Ka'b ibn Malik he stayed behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, [in the Tabuk expedition], Allah said,<i> "Allah will see your actions, and so will His Messenger."</i> (9:105)</p>
<p>	'A'isha said, "When you admire the good deeds of a person, say, <i>'Act, for Allah will see your actions, and so will His Messenger , and the believers'</i> (9:105), and you should not be deluded by anyone."</p>
<p>	Ma'mar said [in <i>Kitab Majaz al-Qur'an</i>], <i>"'That is the Book'" </i>means this Qur'an.<i> "It contains guidance for the godfearing" </i>(2:2) is clarification and direction like His words, <i>'That is Allah's judgement'</i> (60:10): this is the ruling of Allah. <i>'Without any doubt'</i> (2:2) means with no uncertainty. <i>'Those are the signs/verses'</i> (31:2) means these <i>ayats</i> of the Qur'an. It is like, <i>'so that when some of you are on a boat, running before a fair wind'</i> (19:22), i.e. 'with you'."</p>
<p>	Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent his uncle [or my uncle] Haram to his people [the Banu 'Amir] and he said, 'Do you believe that I am conveying the Message of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' He began to relate to them."</p>
<p>	7092. Jubayr ibn Hayya related that al-Mughira said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reported to us from the Message of our Lord that whoever among us is killed [in jihad] will go to the Garden."
</p>
<p>	7093. Masruq related that 'A'isha said, "If anyone tells you that Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, concealed anything‰"</p>
<p>	Another <i>isnad</i> in which Masruq reported that 'A'isha said, "Do not believe anyone who tells you that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, concealed any of the Revelation. Allah Almighty says,<i> 'O Messenger! transmit what has been sent down to you from your Lord. If you do not do it you will not have transmitted His Message. '</i> (5:67)"</p>
<p>	7094. 'Amr ibn Shurahbil said that 'Abdullah said, "A man said, 'Messenger of Allah, which wrong action is the worst in the sight of Allah?' He answered, 'That you appoint an equal to Allah when He created you.' 'Then what?' he asked. He replied, 'That you kill your child less he eat with you.' he asked, 'Then what?' He said, 'That you commit adultery with your neighbour's wife.' Then Allah revealed its confirmation:<i> 'Those who do not call on any other god together with Allah and do not kill anyone Allah has made inviolate, except with the right to do so, and do not fornicate; anyone who does that will receive an evil punishment.'</i> (25:68)"
</p>
<p><b>XLVII.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Say: 'Bring the Torah and recite it."</i> (3:93)</b></p>
<p>	The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "The people of the Torah were given the Torah and acted by it... and the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted on it ... and you will give the Qur'an and acted by it..."</p>
<p>	Abu Razin said that <i>"recite it"</i> (2:121) means "to follow it and act properly by what is in it". It is said that <i>yutla</i> (4:127) is "recite". "Good recitation" is the good recitation of the Qur'an. <i>"la yamassuhu (none shall touch it)"</i> (56:79) means: only someone who believes in the Qur'an experiences its taste and benefit, and only those with certainty bear it properly by His words, <i>"The metaphor of those who were charged with the Torah but then have not upheld it, is that of a donkey loaded with weighty tomes. How evil is the metaphor of those who deny Allah's Signs! Allah does not guide wrongdoing people."</i> (62:5)
</p>
<p>	The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called Islam, faith and prayer action. Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Bilal, "Tell me the most hopeful deed you have done in Islam," and he replied, "I have not done any action more hopeful in my view than the fact that I pray whenever I purify myself."</p>
<p>	The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked, "Which action is best?" He replied, "Belief in Allah and His Messenger, then <i>jihad</i>, then an accepted <i>hajj</i>."</p>
<p>	7095. Salim relateed from Ibn 'Umar  that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Your time as compared to the communities before you is like the time between the<i> 'Asr</i> prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah were given the Torah and acted by it until the middle of the day and then gave up. They were given a qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and acted by it until the <i>'Asr</i> prayer and then gave up. They were given a qirat each. Then we were given the Qur'an and acted (by it) until sunset and we were given two qirats each. The people of both the Books said, 'Our Lord! You have them two qirats each and you only gave us one even though we did more.' Allah said, 'Have I been unjust to you in any way with regard to your reward?' They said, 'No.' He said, 'It is my favour which I give to whomever I wish.'"</p>

<p><b>XLVIII.  The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called the prayer action and said, "The one who does not recite the <i>Fatiha</i> of the Book has no prayer."</b></p>

<p>	7096. Abu 'Amr ash-Shaybani related from Ibn Mas'ud that that a man asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Which is the best action?" He replied, "The prayer at its time, dutifulness to parents, and then jihad in the way of Allah."</p>

<p><b>XLIX.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"Truly man was created headstrong Ç desperate when bad things happen, begrudging when good things come ." </i>(70:19-21)</b></p>
<p>	"<i>Halu'</i> (headstrong)" means discontented.</p>
<p>	7097. Al-Hasan said that 'Amr ibn Taghlib said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought some wealth and he gave to some men and left others out. He heard that they had been critical about it. He said, 'I give to one man and leave out another and yet I love the one whom I leave out more than the one I give to. I give to some people because of the anxiety and unease I see in their hearts. I entrust some people to the wealth and good which Allah has placed in their hearts. One of those is 'Amr ibn Taghlib.'" 'Amr said, "What the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said is dearer to me than red camels."</p>

<p><b>L.  What the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned and transmitted from his Lord</b></p>

<p>	7098. Qatada related from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who related from his Lord: "When the slave comes near Me by a handspan, I come near him a cubit. If he comes near Me by a cubit, I come near him by a fathom. When he comes to Me walking, I come to him running."</p>
<p>	7099. Anas ibn Malik related he may have heard Abu Hurayra say that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the slave comes near Me by a handspan, I come near him a cubit. If he comes near Me by a cubit, I come near him by a fathom."</p>
<p>	Mu'tamir said, I heard my father who heard Anas relate it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who related from his Lord, Mighty and Exalted."</p>
<p>	7100. Muhammad ibn Ziyad related that he heard Abu Hurayra relate from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who related from your Lord, "Every action has reparation, Fasting is mine and I repay it. The changed breath in the mouth of the faster is more fragrant to Allah than the scent of musk."</p>
<p>	7101. Abu'l-'Aliyya related from Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in what he related from his Lord, "It is not proper for someone to sat that he is better than Yunus, son of Matta," ascribing him to his father.</p>
<p>	7102. Mu'awiya ibn Qurra related that 'Abdullah ibn al-Mughaffal al-Muzani said, "On the day of the conquest of Malka, I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a she-camel of his, receiting <i>Surat al-Fath</i> (48) or part of <i>Surat al-Fath</i>." He said, "He was chanting it," and he said, "Then Mu'awiya ibn Qurra recited as Ibn Mughaffal recited and said,  Were I not afraid that the people would gather to you, I would chant it as Ibn Mughaffal chanted it, relating from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' I asked Mu'awiya, "How did he chant? He answered, 'A A A,' three times."
</p>

<p><b>LI.  What is permitted of <i>tafsir</i> of the Torah and other books of Allah in Arabic and other languages as Allah Almighty says, <i>"Bring the Torah and read it out if you are telling the truth."</i> (3:93)</b></p>
<p>	Ibn 'Abbas said, "Sufyan ibn Harb reported to me that Heraclius called for his interpreter and then asked for the letter of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he read it, 'In the Name of Allah, the All-Merciful, Most Merciful, From Muhammad, the slave of Allah and His Messenger to Heraclius,' and<i> 'People of the Book! come to a proposition which is the same for us and you Ç that we should worship none but Allah .'</i> (3:64)"</p>

<p>	7103. Abu Salama related that Abu Hurayra said, "The People of the Book used to recite the Torah in Hebrew and comment on it in Arabic to the people of Islam. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said<i>, 'Do not either confirm nor deny the People of the Book. Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us...</i>" (2:137)'"</p>
<p>	7104. Nafi' related that Ibn 'Umar said, "A Jew and Jewess who had committed fornication were brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He asked the Jews, 'What do you do to them?' They replied, 'We blacken their faces and disgrace them.' He said, 'Bring the Torah and recite it if you are speaking the truth.' they came (with it) and asked an one-eyed man ['Abdullah ibn Suriya] with whom they were pleased to recite. He recited until he reached a place in it and then he placed his hand over it. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Lift your hand.' He removed his hand and there appeared the <i>ayat</i> of stoning.' He said, 'Muhammad, they should be stoned, but we conceal this among ouselves.' So he commanded that they be stoned. I saw the man leaning over her to protect her from the stones."</p>

<p><b>LII.  The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "The one who is skilful in the Qur'an is with the noble just scribes" and  "Adorn the Qur'an with your voices."</b></p>

<p>	7106. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, 'Alqama ibn Waqqas and 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah relate from the hadith of 'A'isha when the people of the Lie said about they said about her, each of them relating some of the <i>hadith</i> that she said, "Then I went to my bed, knowing that I was innocent and that Allah would proclaim me innocent. However, by Allah, I did not think that any revelation would be sent down regarding me. I thought too little of myself for Allah to speak about me in something which was recited. Allah revealed all of the ten verses which begin,<i> 'Those of you who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves...'</i> (24:11)."</p>
<p>	7107. 'Adi ibn Thabit related that al-Bara' said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recite in <i>'Isha'</i>,<i> 'By the Fig and the Olive.'</i> (95) I have never heard anyone with a better voice or recitation than him."</p>

<p>	7109. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Sa'sa'a reported that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said to him, "I see that you love sheep and the desert. When you are among your sheep or in the desert, give the call to prayer and raise your voice when doing it.

<p>	7111. Al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn  Abdu'l-Qari related that they heard 'Umar ibn al-Khattab say, "I heard Hisham ibn Hakim reciting <i>Surat al-Furqan</i> while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was alive. I listened to his recitation and he was reciting it in several modes which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had not recited. I almost grabbed him in the prayer, but I waited until he said the <i>salam</i>. Then I grabbed by his cloak and demanded, 'Who recited to you this <i>sura</i> which I heard you reciting?' He answered, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited it to me.' I said, 'You lied! The Messenger of Allah,  recited it to me differently to how you recited it!' So I led him off to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I heard this one reciting <i>Surat al-Furqan</i> in a different way to how you recited it to me!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Release him. Recite, Hisham.' So he recited it to him in the way which I had heard him reciting.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'That is how it was revealed.' Then he said, 'Recite, Umar,' and I recited it in the recitation he had taught me. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'That is how it was revealed. This Qur'an was revealed in seven modes, so recite whatever you find easy of it.'"
</p>
<p><b>LIV.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"We have made the Qur'an easy to remember. "</i> (54:17,22,32,40)</b></p>
<p>	The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  said, "Each is eased to what he was created for." It is said that "eased" means "prepared".</p>
<p>	Matar al-Warraq said about <i>"We have made the Qur'an easy to remember. But is there any rememberer there?"</i> (54:17) that it means "Is there anyone who seeks knowledge so that he can benefit from it?"</p>
<p>	7112. Mutarrif ibn 'Abdullah related that 'Imran said, "I asked, 'Messenger of Allah for what do those who act act?' He replied, 'Each is eased to what he was created for.'"
</p>
<p>	7113. Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman related from 'Ali that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  was in a funeral and he picked up a stick and began to mark the earth with it. He said, 'There is none of you but that his place in the Garden or his place in the Fire is written for him.' They asked, 'Should we not then rely (on what is written)?' He replied, 'Act. Each is eased. <i>"As for him who gives out and has taqwa "</i> (92:5)'"</p>

<p><b>LV.  The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"It is indeed a Glorious Qur'an preserved on a Tablet."</i> (85:21-22)</b></p>
<p>	<i>"By the Mount and an Inscribed Book" </i>(52:1-2): Qatada said that "<i>mastur</i>" means "written". "<i>Yasturun</i>" (68:1) means "they inscribe", and the <i>Umm al-Kitab</i> (43:4) is the whole of the Qur'an and its source. [He said that] "<i>ma talfizu</i>" (50:18) means: "He does not say anything but that it is written against him." Ibn 'Abbas said, "Both good and evil are recorded," and "<i>yuharrufuna</i>" (4:46) means "they remove". No one removes the works of one of the Books of Allah Almighty, but they twist them, interpreting them improperly. "<i>Dirasatihim</i>: (6:156) means "their recitation" "<i>Wa'iyya</i>" (69:12) is preserving, "<i>ta'iha</i>" (69:12) means to "preserve it". <i>"This Qur'an has been revealed to me by inspiration that I may warn you,"</i> meaning the people of Makka, <i>"and all whom it reaches"</i>(6:19) meaning this Qur'an, so he is its warner.
</p>
<p>	7114. Abu Rafi' related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When Allah finished creation, He wrote a book with Him (which said), 'My mercy overpowered (or preceded) My anger.' It is with Him above the Throne."</p>
<p>	7115. Abu Rafi' related that he heard Abu Hurayra say that he heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Allah wrote a book before He created creation: 'My mercy preceded My anger.' It is written with Him above the Throne,"</p>

<p><b>LVI. The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"When Allah created both you and what you do"</i> (37:96)</b></p>
<p>	<i>"We have created all things in due measure."</i> (54:49)</p>
<p>		It will be said to those who make images, "Bring what you have created to life."</p>
<p><i>	"Your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then settled Himself firmly on the Throne. He covers the day with the night, each pursuing the other urgently; and the sun and moon and stars are subservient to His command. Both creation and command belong to Him. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all the worlds."</i> (7:54)</p>
<p>	Ibn 'Uyayna said, "Allah distinguishes creation from the command when He says, '<i>Both creation and command belong to Him.'</i>" (7:54)</p>
<p>	The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called faith action. Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked, 'Which actions are best?' and he replied, 'Faith in Allah and jihad in His Way.'"</p>
<p>	Allah says, <i>"As recompense for what they did."</i> (56:24)</p>
<p>The delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Enjoin on us instructions which will enable us to enter the Garden if we do them." He commanded them to believe and to testify [to Allah's oneness], perform the prayer and pay <i>zakat</i>. He made all of that action.</p>
<p>	7116. It is related that Zahdam said, "There was friendship and mutual favours between this tribe of Jurm and the Ash'arites. While we were with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, he was brought some food which contained chicken meat. With him was a man from the Banu Taymu'llah who looked like one of the clients.  Abu Musa incited him to eat, but the man said, 'I saw them eating something filthy and I swore that I would never eat that.' Abu Musa said, 'Come and I will inform you about that. I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the group of the Ash'arites, asking him to give us mounts. He said, 'By Allah, I will not give you mounts, and I do not have any mounts to give you.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought some camels as booty and he asked about us, saying, 'Where are those Ash'arites?' He commanded for us five camels with white humps. When we left, we said, 'What have we done? The Messenger of Allat, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, swore that he would not give us any mounts and that he did not have any mounts to give us. Then he gave us mounts. The Messenger of Allaht, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has forgotten his oath. By Allah, we will never proser!' So we returned to him and spoke to him. He said, 'I have not give you mounts, but Allah has given you mounts. By Allah, I will never make an oath and then see something better than it without doing the thing that is better and then doing expiation for it.'"</p>
<p>	7117. Abu Jamra ad-Duba'i said, "I spoke to Ibn 'Abbas and he said, 'The delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'The unbelievers of Mudar are between us and you and we can only come to you in the sacred months. Give us some clear instructions by which we may enter the Garden and to which we can summon those we left behind." He said, 'I instruct you to do four things and forbid them to do four things. I command you to believe in Allah, to testify that there is no god but Allah, to establish the prayers, to pay the <i>zakat</i>, and to pay the <i>khums</i> (fifth) from booty you take. I forbide you four things: do not drink from the <i>dubba', naqir, zuruf muzaffata</i> or <i>hantam</i> [different kinds of wine vessels]."'"</p>
<p>	7118. Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad related from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The people who make these images will be punished on the Day of Rising and will be told, 'Bring what you created to life.'"</p>
<p>	7119. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "The people who make these images will be punished on the Day of Rising and will be told, 'Bring what you created to life.'"</p>
<p>	7120. Abu Zur'a related from Abu Hurayra that he heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Allah, Mighty and Exalted is He, said, 'Who does greater wrong that those who intend to create as I create? Let them create the smallest ant (or let them create a grain or a barley grain.)."</p>

<p><b>LVII. The recitation of someone impious or a hypocrite. Their voices and recitation do not go beyond their throats</b></p>
<p>	7120. Anas related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, The metaphor of a believer who recites the Qur'an is that of a citron - its taste is fragrant and its scent is good. That of someone who does not recite the Qur'an is that of a date Ç its taste is sweet, but it has no scent. The metaphor of someone impious who recites the Qur'an is that of basil - its scent is fragrant but its taste is bitter. The metaphor of someone impious who does not recite the Qur'an is that of colocynth - its taste is bitter and it has no scent."</p>
<p>	7121. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr was heard to relate that 'A'isha said, Some people asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about soothsayers and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to them,  'They have nothing.' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, sometimes they tell us something and then it turns out to be true.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'That is a true word which a jinn caught hold of and poured into the ear of his friend, but they mix a hundred lies with it.'"</p>
<p>	7122. Ma'bad ibn Sirin related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Some people will emerge from the east. They will recite the Qur'an but it does not pass beyond their throats. They will leave the <i>deen</i> like the arrow passes through game. They will not return to it unless the arrow returns to middle of the bow." He was asked, "What will their sign be?" He answered, "Their sign is shaving," (or removing hair)."</p>

<p><b>LVIII. The words of Allah Almighty, <i>"We will set up the Just Balance on the Day of Rising,"</i> (21:47) and the deeds and words of the children of Adam will be weighed</b></p>
<p>	Mujahid said that "<i>qistas</i>" (17:35, 26:182) means "balance" in Greek. It is said that qist is the verb noun of <i>miqsat</i>, which is the just. <i>Qísit</i> is the tyrant.</p>
<p>	7123. Abu Zur'a related from Abu Hurayra  that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are two words which are beloved to the All-Merciful, which are light on the tongue and heavy in the balance: Glory be to Allah and by His praise. Glory be to Allah the Immense (<i>Subhana'llahi wa bihamdihi Subhana'llahi'l-'adhim</i>)."</p>
