Prayer</A></BIG></B></FONT>
<P>
<P>
<B>I: The Rain Prayer and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, going out for the Rain Prayer</B>
<P>
960. It is related that the uncle of 'Abbad ibn Tamim said, "The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to ask for rain and turned
his cloak inside out."
<P>
<P>
<B>II: The supplication of the Prophet, "Give them years of drought like
the drought years of Yusuf!"</B>
<P>
961. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the when the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, raised his head from the last<I> rak'at</I>,
he would say, "O Allah, rescue 'Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'a! O Allah, rescue Salama
ibn Hisham! O Allah, rescue al-Walid ibn al-Walid! O Allah, rescue all oppressed
believers! O Allah, be hard on Mudar! O Allah, give them years of drought
like the drought years of Yusuf!" And the Prophet. may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, added, "May Allah forgive (<I>ghafara</I>) Ghifar and keep
(<I>salama</I>) Aslam safe."
<P>
Ibn Abi'z-Zinad said about his father, "All of this was in the <I>Subh</I>
prayer."
<P>
962. It is related that Masruq said, "We were with 'Abdullah and he said,
'When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,saw people turning
their backs on Islam, he said, "O Allah, seven years like the years of Yusuf!"
They suffered a drought which destroyed everything so that they were eating
skins, carrion and rotting carcases. If any of them looked up into the sky
they would see smoke because of their hunger. Abu Sufyan went to him and
said, "Muhammad! You command people to obey Allah and maintain ties of kinship.
Your people are dying, so pray to Allah for them." Then Allah Almighty said<I>,
"So be on the watch for a day when heaven brings forth a distinctive smoke
which enshrouds mankind </I>...to... <I>you revert ! On the day We launch
the Great Assault." </I>(44:10-16)' The 'assault' refers to the battle of
Badr. And the 'smoke', the assault, <I>al-lizam</I> [i.e. killing] and the
verse about the Greeks have all taken place."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: People asking the Imam to ask for rain when there is a drought</B>
<P>
963. It is related that the father of 'Abdullah ibn Dinar said, "I heard
Ibn 'Umar reciting the poem of Abu Talib:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Faultless, he is asked, by his noble face, to pray for rain,
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; A support for the orphans, a defence for the widows."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
It is related that Salim said that his father (Ibn 'Umar) said, "Sometimes
I remembered the words of the poet while looking at the face of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,when he was praying for rain. He
did not get down until the rain was flowing in every gutter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Faultless, he is asked, by his noble face, to pray for rain,
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;A support for the orphans, a defence for the widows.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
Those were the words of Abu Talib."
<P>
964. It is related from Anas, "If there was a drought, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
would ask al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib to do the rain prayer. He would
say, 'O Allah, we seek intercession with You by Your Prophet and we ask You
for rain. We seek intercession with You by the uncle of our Prophet, so give
us rain!'" He added, "And they were given rain."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: Turning the cloak inside out during the Rain Prayer</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#r1">965</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Zayd that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed for rain and
turned his cloak inside out.
<P>
967. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Zayd, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went out to the place of prayer and prayed for rain.
He faced the <I>qibla</I> and turned his cloak inside out and prayed two
<I>rak'ats</I>."
<P>
Ibn 'Uyayna used to say, "He was the one of the <I>adhan</I>," but it is
weak because this 'Abdullah ibn Zayd is 'Abdullah ibn Zayd ibn 'Asim al-Mazini
from the Mazin of the Ansar."
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Doing the Rain Prayer in the Communal Mosque</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#r3">968</A>. It is related from Sharik ibn 'Abdullah ibn
Abi Namir that he heard Anas ibn Malik mention that on the day of <I>Jumu'a
</I>a man entered the door opposite the minbar while the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing giving the
<I>khutba</I>. He stood in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger of Allah, our livestock are
dying and the roads are blocked, so make supplication to Allah to give us
rain." He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, raised his hands and said, 'O Allah, give us rain! O Allah, give us
rain! O Allah, give us rain.'"
<P>
Anas said, "By Allah, we could not see a cloud or even a speck of cloud or
anything else in the sky and there was no house or building between us and
Sila'." He went on, "Then a cloud looking like a shield rose up behind him
and when it reached the middle of the sky it spread out and then it rained."
He said, "By Allah, we did not see the sun for a week. Then a man entered
by the same door the next <I>Jumu'a</I> while the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, was giving the <I>khutba</I>, stood
in front of him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, our property is being destroyed
and the roads are blocked, so make supplication to Allah to stop it.'" He
said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, raised
his hands and then said, 'O Allah, around us and not on us! O Allah, on the
hill-tops and mountains, hills, valleys and the places where trees grow.'"
He said, "It stopped and we left walking in the sunshine."
<P>
Sharik said, "I asked Anas, 'Was it the same man?' He replied, 'I do not
know.'"
<P>

He stood in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and said, "Messenger of Allah, our property is being destroyed
and the roads are blocked, so make supplication to Allah to give us rain."

hands and said, 'O Allah, rescue us! O Allah, rescue us! O Allah, rescue
us.'"
<P>
Anas said, "By Allah, we could not see a cloud or even a speck of cloud or
anything else in the sky and there was no house or bulding between us and
Sal'." He said, "Then a cloud looking like a shield rose up behind him and
when it reached the middle of the sky, it spread out and then it rained."
He went on, "By Allah, we did not see the sun for six days. Then a man entered
by the same door on<I> Jumu'a</I> while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was giving the <I>khutba</I>. He stood in
front of him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, property is being destroyed and
the roads are blocked, so make supplication to Allah to stop it.'" He said,
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, raised
his hands and then said, 'O Allah, around us and not on us! O Allah, on the
hill-tops, hills, in the valleys and the places where trees grow.'" He said,
"It ceased and we left walking in the sunshine."
<P>
Sharik said, "I asked Anas, 'Was it the same man?' He replied, 'I do not
know.'"

bless him and grant him peace, was giving the <I>khutba</I> on the day of
<I>Jumu'a</I>, a man came and said, 'Messenger of Allah, there is a lack
of rain, so pray to Allah to give us rain.' He made supplication and it rained
so much that we could hardly reach our homes. It continued raining until
the next Jumu'a." He continued, "That man or someone else got up and said,
'Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to avert it from us.' The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'O Allah, around us and not
on us.'" He said, "I saw the clouds breaking up to the right and the left
and it continued to rain, but it did not rain over Madina."
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Thinking it enough to ask for rain during the<I> Jumu'a</I> prayer</B>
<P>
970. It is related that Anas said, "A man came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Our livestock are dying and the
roads are blocked.' He made supplication and it rained from one<I> Jumu'a</I>
to the next. Then he came and said, 'Our houses are destroyed and the roads
are blocked and livestock is perishing, so ask Allah to stop it. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up and said, 'O
Allah, on the hilltops, hills, valleys and the places where trees grow.'
The clouds peeled away from Madina like clothes that had been taken off."
<P>

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of
Allah, our livestock is dying and the roads are blocked, so pray to Allah.'
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made
supplication and it rained from on<I>e Jumu'a</I> to another. A man came
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,
'Messenger of Allah, our houses are being destroyed, the roads are blocked
and livestock is dying.' So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'O Allah, on the tops of the mountains, the hill tops,
in the valleys and the places where trees grow.' The clouds peeled away from
Madina like clothes that had been taken off."
<P>

for rain on the day of<I> Jumu'a</I></B>

supplication and it rained from one<I> Jumu'a </I>to another. A man came
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,
'Messenger of Allah, our houses are being destroyed, the roads are blocked
and livestock is dying.' So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'O Allah, on the tops of the mountains, the hill tops,
in the valleys and the places where trees grow.' The clouds peeled away from
Madina like clothes that had been taken off."
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: When the idolaters ask the Muslims to intercede for them in a time
of drought</B>
<P>
974. It is related that Masruq said, "I went to Ibn Mas'ud and he said, 'Quraysh
were slow to beome Muslim and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, invoked Allah against them and they suffered a drought during
which some of them died and they were forced to eat carrion and bones. Abu
Sufyan came to him and said, 'O Muhammad, you came to command that ties of
kinship be maintained. Your people are dying, so make supplication to Allah.'
He recited, '<I>So be on the watch for a day when heaven brings forth a
distinctive smoke</I>.' Then after that they reverted to disbelief. And that
brought about the words of Allah Almighty, '<I>On the day We launch the Great
Assault</I>.' Referring to the Battle of Badr."
<P>
Asbat added from Mansur, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, made supplication and they received rain which continued
for for seven days. The people complained about there being too much rain
and he said, 'O Allah, around us and not on us,' and the clouds streamed
away from over his head, and the people around them had rain.'"

is too much rain </B>
<P>
975. It is related that Anas said, "Once while the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was giving the <I>khutba</I> on the day o<I>f
Jumu'a</I>, people got up and shouted, saying, 'Messenger of Allah! There
is no rain and the trees have turned red from the drought and the animals
are dying, so pray to Allah to give us rain.' He said twice, 'O Allah, give
us rain!' By Allah, we could not see even a speck of cloud in the sky but
then a cloud formed and it rained. He came down from the minbar and did the
prayer. When he had finished, it was raining and continued to do so until
the followin<I>g Jumu'a.</I> When the Prophet. may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, stood up to give the <I>khutba</I> they shouted out to him, 'Our
houses are collapsing and the roads are blocked, so pray to Allah to hold
it back from us.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smiled
and said, 'O Allah, around us and not on us.' It cleared away from Madina
and began to rain all round it but not a drop fell on Madina. I looked at
Madina and it was as if it was in a crown."
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: Supplication while standing in the Rain Prayer</B>
<P>
976. It is related from Abu Ishaq, "'Abdullah ibn Yazid al-Ansari went out

up in front of them, without there being any minbar, and asked for forgiveness
and then prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> in which he recited aloud. There was neither
<I>adhan</I> nor <I>iqama</I>." Abu Ishaq said, "'Abdullah ibn Yazid had
seen the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."

bless him and grant him peace, raised his hands to make supplication and
the people raised their hands with him." He went on, "We had not left the
mosque before it started raining. It continued to rain until the next

Jumu'a</I>, a Bedouin stood up and said, 'Messenger of Allah, our property
is being destroyed and our children are hungry, so pray to Allah for us to
give us rain." He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, raised his hands when there was not a speck in the sky."
He went on, "Then clouds piled up like mountains and before he had got down
from his minbar I saw the rain trickling down his beard. It rained on us
that day and the next and the following and the ones after until the next
<I>Jumu'a </I>when that Bedouin or another man stood up and said, "Allah,
buildings are being destroyed and animals are drowning so pray to Allah for
us.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, raised
his hands and said, 'O Allah, around us and not on us.'" He added, "Whenever
he pointed with his hand at part of the sky, it opened up so that Madina

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished, he faced the
people and said, 'Do you know what your Lord has said?' They said, 'Allah
and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'Some of My slaves have got up this
morning believing in Me, and others have got up disbelieving in Me. As for
those who say, "We had rain by the bounty and mercy of Allah," they are the
ones who believe in Me and disbelieve in the stars. But those who say, "We
had rain by the rising of such-and-such a star," have disbelieved in Me and
believed in the stars.'"

and went dragging his cloak into the mosque. We entered and he led us, praying
two <I>rak'ats</I>, until the sun had become clear again. The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The sun and the moon do not eclipse
because of anyone's death. When you see them, pray and make supplication
until they are over.'"
<P>
994. It is related that Abu Mas'ud was heard to say that the Prophet, may

<P>
995. It is related that Ibn 'Umar reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless

996. It is related that al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said, "There was a solar eclipse
in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, on the day that Ibrahim died and the people said, 'The sun is eclipsed
because of the death of Ibrahim.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'The sun and the moon do not eclipse because
of anyone's life or death. Rather they are two of the signs of Allah. When
you see them, pray and make supplication to Allah.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: <I>Sadaqa</I> during eclipses </B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw4.html#e1">997</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "There was
an eclipse of the sun in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, led the people in prayer. He stood, and did so for a
long time. Then he went into <I>ruku'</I> and made the<I> ruku' </I>long.
Then he stood again, and did so for a long time, though not as long as the
first time. Then he went into <I>ruku' </I>and made the <I>ruku' </I>long,
though not as long as the first time. Then he prostrated and made the prostration
long. Then he did the same in the second rak'at as he had done the first<I>
rak'at</I>. Then he finished when the sun had appeared. He addressed the
people and praised and glorified Allah. Then he said, 'The sun and moon are
two of Allah's signs. They do not eclipse for the life or death of anyone.
When you see an eclipse, call on Allah and say "Allah is greater" and pray
and give <I>sadaqa</I>.' He then said, 'O community of Muhammad! By Allah,
there is no one more jealous than Allah with regard to a male or female slave
of his committing adultery. O community of Muhammad! By Allah, if you knew
what I knew, you would laugh little and weep much.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>III The call that the prayer for the eclipse is to be a group prayer</B>

Then he said, 'Allah hears whoever praises him. Our Lord, praise is Yours.'
Then he prostrated and then said in the second <I>rak'at </I>the like of

eclipse in Madina, your brother did not pray any more than two <I>rak'ats

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took refuge in Allah from that.
Then one morning the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, went out on a journey and there was an eclipse of the sun, and he
returned in the late morning and passed through behind his rooms. Then he
stood and prayed, and the people stood behind him. He stood for a long time,

not eclipse for the life or death of anyone. When you see them, then remember
Allah.'
<P>
"They said, 'Messenger of Allah, we saw you reach out for something while
you were standing here and then we saw you withdraw.' He said, 'I saw the
Garden and I reached out for a bunch of grapes from it, and if I had taken
it, you would have been able to eat from it for as long as this world lasted.
Then I saw the Fire - and I have never seen anything more hideous than what
I saw today - and I saw that most of its people were women.' They said, 'Why,
Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'Because of their ingratitude.' It was asked,
'Are they ungrateful to Allah?' He said, 'They are ungrateful to their husbands,
and they are ungrateful for good behaviour (towards them). Even if you were
to behave well to one of them for a whole lifetime and she were to see you
do something (that she did not like) she would say that she had never seen
anything good from you.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: Women praying with the men in the eclipse</B>
<P>
1005. It is related from Asma' bint Abi Bakr that she said, "I went to 'A'isha,
the wife of the Prophet, when there was a solar eclipse. The people were
standing in prayer and she was also standing in prayer. I said, 'What are
the people doing?' She pointed towards the sky and said, 'Glory be to Allah!'
I said, 'A sign?' She indicated that it was so. I also stood to pray until
I was overcome and fainted. I began to pour water over my head. When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished the
prayer, he praised Allah and lauded Him and then said, 'Anything which I
did not see before I saw just now while standing here, including the Garden
and the Fire. It was revealed to me that you will be tested in the graves
with a like trial - or nearly like - [I do not know exactly which Asma' said]
to that of the False Messiah. Each of you will be approached and asked, "What
do you know of this man? The believer - or the one who is certain - [I do
not know which exactly Asma' said] will say, "He is Muhammad, the Messenger
of Allah who brought us the clear signs and guidance. So we responded to
him, believed and followed him." He will be told, "Sleep, O virtuous one!"
We know that you believed in him.' As for the hypocrite or the doubter -
[I do not know which Asma' said] he will say, "I do not know. I heard people
saying something and so I said it too."'"

he raised his head and did a long recitation which was shorter than his first
one. Then he did a lo<I>ng ruku'</I> which was shorter than his first<I>
ruku'</I>. Then he raised his head and then did two <I>sajdas</I>. Then he
stood up again and did the same in the second<I> rak'at.</I> Then he stood

anyone, but they are two of the signs of Allah which he shows His slaves.
When you see such a thing, go to the prayer.'"

<P>
1010. It is related that Abu Musa said, "There was an eclipse of the sun
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up in alarm,
fearing that the Last Hour had come. He went to the mosque and prayed with
the longest standing, <I>ruku' </I>and <I>sajda</I> I ever saw him do. He
said, "These are signs which Allah sends, not because of the life or death
of anyone but rather to make His slaves feel fear so if you see something
like that, hurry to remember Him, make supplication and ask His forgiveness.'"

in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, on the day that Ibrahim died and the people said, 'The sun is eclipsed
because of the death of Ibrahim.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'The sun and the moon do not eclipse because
of anyone's life or death. When you see them, pray and make supplication
to Allah.'"

of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he
went out dragging his cloak until he reached the mosque. The people gathered
to him and he led them in praying two <I>rak'ats</I>. He said, 'The sun and
moon are two of Allah's signs. They do not eclipse for the death of anyone.
When that happens, pray and make supplication until it clears.' That was
when a son of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called
Ibrahim had died. People were saying that it happened because of that."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: The first <I>rak'at</I> is longer in the eclipse</B>

<B>XIX: Reciting aloud in the eclipse</B>
<P>
1016. It is related from 'A'isha, "In the eclipse prayer, the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited aloud. When he finished his
recitation, he said the <I>takbir</I> and did <I>ruku'</I>. When he came
up from <I>ruku'</I>, he said, 'Allah hears the one who praises him. Our
Lord, and praise is Yours." Then he again recited. The eclipse prayer has
four <I>ruk'us </I>and four <I>sajdas</I> in two rak'ats.
<P>
It is related from 'A'isha, "The sun was eclipsed in the time of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he sent out someone
to announce that the prayer was to be held in a group. He went forward and
prayed four <I>ruk'us </I>and four <I>sajdas</I> in two <I>rak'ats</I>."
<P>
'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Namir heard the same from Ibn Shihab.
<P>
Az-Zuhri said, "I said, 'What did your brother, 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr,
do then? He only prayed two<I> rak'ats </I>like <I>Subh</I> when he prayed
in Madina.' He said, 'Indeed! He was mistaken as to the <I>sunna</I>."
<P>
Sufyan ibn Husayn and Sulayman ibn Kathir corroborated from az-Zuhri that
it is done aloud.

'Uthman said, "The <I>sajda</I> is obligatory for all who hear it." Az-Zuhri

<P>
1035. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and his Companions arrived on the fourth morning of
the month of hajj saying the <I>talbiya</I>. He commanded them to make it
an <I>'umra</I> except for those with sacrificial animals with them."
<P>
Jabir corroborated it.
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: How long must a journey be to shorten the prayer</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called travelling a
day and a night a journey. Ibn 'Abbas used to shorten the prayer and break
the fast for a distance of four <I>burud</I> (postal stages) which is sixteen
farsakhs.
<P>
1036. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "A woman should not travel for three days without
a <I>dhu mahram</I> [close male relative]."

1037. See 1036.
<P>
Ibn al-Mubarak corroborated it from 'Ubaydullah.
<P>
1038. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "It is not lawful for a woman
who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel the distance of a day and
a night without having a <I>mahram</I> with her."

<P>
<P>
<B>V: You can shorten the prayer when you have left the place you live</B>

may Allah bless him and grant him peace, doing four <I>rak'ats</I> in Madina
and we prayed two <I>rak'ats </I>at Dhu'l-Hulayfa."
<P>
1040. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the prayers were first made
obligatory, they were all two <I>rak'ats</I>. Then the travelling prayer
stayed the same but the prayer of the resident was made complete."
<P>
Az-Zuhri said, "I asked 'Urwa, 'Why did 'A'isha do the full prayers?' He
said, 'She followed the same interpretation as 'Uthman.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Praying three <I>rak'ats </I>for <I>Maghrib</I> while travelling</B>
<P>
1041. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I saw the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he was in a hurry on
a journey, delay <I>Maghrib</I> and join it with<I> 'Isha'</I>." Salim said,
"'Abdullah used to do that when he was in a hurry on a journey."
<P>
Salim added, "Ibn 'Umar used to join <I>Maghrib</I> and <I>'Isha</I> at
Muzdalifa."
<P>
Salim said, "Ibn 'Umar delayed <I>Maghrib</I> when he heard that his wife,
Safiyya bint Abi 'Ubayd, was dying [or had died]. I said to him, 'The prayer!'
He said, 'Carry on.' I said, 'The prayer!' He said, 'Carry on,' until he
had gone two or three miles. Then he got down and prayed and said, 'This
is how I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray when
he was travelling in a hurry.' 'Abdullah said, "When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was travelling in a hurry, I saw
him delay <I>Maghrib</I> and then pray it doing thre<I>e rak'ats.</I> Then
he would say the <I>taslim</I> and then after a short time the <I>iqama</I>
was said for<I> 'Isha' </I>and he prayed it doing two <I>rak'ats</I>. Then
he said the <I>taslim</I>. He did not do any supererogatory prayers after
<I>'Isha' </I>until he got up in the middle of the night."

'I saw you praying facing other than the <I>qibla</I>.' He said, 'If I had
not seen the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
doing it, I would not have done it.'"

may His mention be exalted, says, <I>'You have a good model in the Messenger
of Allah.'</I> (33:21)"
<P>
1051. It is related that Ibn 'Umar was heard to say, "I accompanied the Messenger

conquered, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did
<I>ghusl</I> in her house and prayed eight <I>rak'ats</I>. 'I never saw him
do a more rudimentary prayer than it, but he did a complete<I> ruku'</I>
and <I>sujud</I>.'"

Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was hurrying during a journey,
I saw him delay the <I>Maghrib</I> prayer and join it with <I>'Isha'</I>."
Salim said, "'Abdullah used to do that when he was in a hurry on a journey.
He would say the iqama for <I>Maghrib</I> and pray it doing three
<I>rak'ats</I>, then say the <I>taslim</I>. After a short time, he would
say the <I>iqama</I> for<I> 'Isha'</I> and pray it doing two<I> rak'at</I>s,
then say the <I>taslim</I> and not do a single supererogatory <I>rak'at</I>

to be followed. When he goes into <I>ruku</I>', go into<I> ruku'</I>, and
when he rises, rise'"
<P>
1063. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, fell from his horse while riding and his right side
was grazed. We went to visit him and the time for the prayer arrived. He

Imam is appointed to be followed. Say the <I>takbir</I> when he says the
<I>takbir</I>. Go into <I>ruku' </I>when he goes int<I>o ruku'</I>, and get
up when he gets up. When he says, "Allah hears whoever praises Him," say,

1064. It is related from 'Imran ibn Husyan, who had piles, "I asked the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about the prayer of a

sitting down."

half the reward of someone standing. And anyone who prays lying down has
only half the reward of someone who prays sitting down."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "I think that <I>na'im</I> here means lying down."

standing. Then he did<I> ruku'</I> and <I>sajda</I>. He did the same thing
in the second<I> rak'at</I>. When his prayer ended he would look over and
if I was awake he would talk to me and if I was asleep he would lie down."

<P>
1069. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas was heard to say, "When the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up in the night to pray
<I>tahajjud</I>, he would say, 'O Allah, Yours is the praise. You are the
upholder of the heavens and the earth and everyone in them. Yours is the
praise. Yours is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everyone in
them. Yours is the praise - Light of the heavens and the earth - Yours is
the praise. You are the Truth. Your promise is true. The meeting with You
is true. Your word is true. The Garden is true and the Fire is true. The
Prophets are true and Muhammad is true. The Hour is true. O Allah, I have
submitted to You and I have believed in You. In You I have put my trust and
to You I turn. I argue by You and take You as arbitrator. Forgive me my past
and future wrong actions and what I keep secret and what I make known. You
are the One who puts forward and defers. There is no god but You - or there
is no god other than You.'"

Allah."

<P>
1070. It is related from Salim that his father said, "In the lifetime of
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, if someone had a dream,
he would recount it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace. I wanted to have a dream so that I could recount it to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. I was a youth and used
to sleep in the mosque during the time of the Messenger of Allah. I dreamt
that two angels took me and brought me to the Fire which was enclosed like
a well. It had two sides and there were people in it whom I recognised. I
began to say, 'I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire.' Then I met another
man who said to me, 'Do not be alarmed.' I told the dream to Hafsa who told
it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He
said, ''Abdullah is an excellent man. If only he would pray during the night.'"
After that he spent very little of the night asleep.
<P>
<P>

<P>
1071. It is related from 'A'isha, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to pray eleven <I>rak'ats</I>. Such was his
prayer. In them he would stay in <I>sajda</I> long enough for one of you
to recite fifty <I>ayats</I> before lifting his head. He would pray two
<I>rak'ats </I>before the <I>Fajr</I> prayer and then lie down on his right
side until someone came to him to call him to the prayer."
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: A sick person not doing the night prayer</B>
<P>

him and grant him peace, was ill and did not get up for one or two nights."
<P>
1073. It is related that Jundub ibn 'Abdullah said, "Jibril did not come
to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for a time and a
Qurayshi woman remarked, 'His shaytan has kept him waiting.' Then the revelation
came, <I>'By the brightness of the morning and the night when it is still,
your Lord has not abandoned you nor does He hate you.'</I> (93:1-3)"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: The Prophet encouraging people to do the night prayer and supererogatory
prayers without making them obligatory</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, knocked at the door
of Fatima and 'Ali, peace be upon them, during the night to get them up for
the prayer.
<P>
1074. Umm Salama said, "One night the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, woke up and said, 'Glory be to Allah! How many afflictions have
been revealed tonight and how many treasures disclosed! Go and wake up the
women of the rooms Many a person who is dressed in this world will be naked
in the Next!'"
<P>
1075. It is related from 'Ali ibn Abi Talib that one night the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to him and Fatima daughter of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and knocked at their door.
"He said, 'Do you not pray?' I said, 'Messenger of Allah, our souls are in
the hand of Allah. If He wishes to wake us up, we wake up.' When I said that
he left without another word. But then I heard him turning and striking his
thigh, saying, <I>"But of all things man is the most
argumentative!"(</I>18:54)'"
<P>
<A HREF="muw3.html#t32">1076</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to sometimes stop
doing an action, in spite of it being something he loved to do, out of the
fear that other people might do it and it would become obligatory for them.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, never prayed
the <I>Duha</I> prayer, but I pray it."
<P>
1077. It is related from 'A'isha, the Umm al-Mu'minin, "One night the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed in the mosque and
some people prayed together with him. Then he prayed the next night and there
were more people. Then they gathered on the third or fourth night, but the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not go out
to them. In the morning, he said, 'I saw what you were doing and the only
thing that kept me from coming out to you was that I was afraid that it would
be made obligatory for you.' That was in Ramadan."
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: The Prophet standing in prayer until his feet were swollen</B>
<P>
'A'isha said, "until his feet were cracked." <I>Futur</I> means cracking
and <I>infatarat</I> means to be cracked.
<P>
1078. It is related that al-Mughira said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to stand in prayer until his feet - or legs - were
swollen. He was asked about it and said, 'Should I not be a grateful slave?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Someone sleeping in the time before dawn</B>
<P>
1079. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As, "The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The prayer Allah loves most is
the prayer of Da'ud, peace be upon him, and the fast which Allah loves most
is the fast of Da'ud, peace be upon him. He used to sleep half the night,
pray for for a third and then go to sleep again for a sixth, and he used
to fast every other day."
<P>
1080. It is related that Masruq said, "I asked 'A'isha, 'What action did
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, love most?' She said,
'That which is done with constancy.' I said, 'When would he get up?' She
said, 'He used to get up when he heard the cock crow.'"
<P>
1081. It is related that al-Ash'ath said, "When he heard the cock crow, he
got up and prayed."

<I>Subh</I></B>
<P>
1083. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Zayd ibn Thabit would eat
<I>sahur</I> and when they had finished it, the Prophet of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, would get up to pray and then perform the
prayer." Qatada said, "We asked Anas, 'How long was there between their finishing
<I>sahur</I> and beginning the prayer?' He answered, 'As long as it takes
a man to recite fifty <I>ayats</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: Standing for a long time in the night prayer</B>
<P>
1084. It is related from Abu Wa'il that 'Abdullah said, "I prayed one night
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he kept on
standing so long that I thought of doing something bad." Abu Wa'il said,
"We said, 'What did you think of doing?' He said, 'I thought of sitting down
and leaving the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"
<P>
1085. It is related from Hudhayfa, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, got up for <I>tahajjud</I> in the night, he would clean
out his mouth with the <I>siwak</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>X: How the Prophet prayed and how many <I>rak'ats</I> the Prophet prayed
at night</B>
<P>
1086. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "A man asked, 'Messenger
of Allah, what form does the night prayer take?' He said, 'It is two by two,
and when you fear the coming of <I>Subh</I>, perform one for the
<I>witr</I>.'"
<P>
1087. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, " The prayer of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to be thirteen<I> rak'ats</I>,"

the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at night.
She said, 'It was seven, nine or eleven <I>rak'ats </I>not counting the two
<I>rak'ats</I> of <I>Fajr</I>."
<P>
1089. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to pray thirteen <I>rak'ats</I> during the night,
including the <I>witr</I> and the two <I>rak'ats</I> of <I>Fajr</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: The Prophet waking up at night for night prayers and the amount of
the night prayer that was abrogated</B>
<P>
This is in&nbsp;reference to the words of Allah Almighty,<I> "O you enwrapped
in your clothing, stay up at night, except a little, half of it, or a little
less, or a little more, and recite the Qur'an distinctly. We will impose
a weighty Word upon you. Certainly rising at night has a stronger effect
and is more conducive to concentration. In the daytime much of your time
is taken up by business matters," </I>(73:1-7)
<P>
And His words,<I> "He knows you will not keep count of it, so He has turned
towards you. Recite as much of the Qur'an as is easy for you. He knows that
some of you are ill and that others are travelling in the land seeking Allah's
bounty, and that others are fighting in the Way of Allah. So recite as much
of it as is easy for you. And establish the prayer and pay zakat and lend
a good loan to Allah. Whatever good you forward for yourselves you will find
it with Allah as something better and as a greater reward."</I> (73:20)

Ibn 'Abbas said, "<I>Nasha'</I> is to get up in Abyssinian. <I>Wata'</I>
refers to the weight of the Qur'an meaning its being intensely approved of
by his ears, eyes and heart. <I>Wata'a</I> means to be in agreement."

him and grant him peace, used sometimes not to fast for so much of a month
that we thought that he would not fast for any of it, and other times he
would fast so much that we thought that he would not break his fast at all.
If you wanted to see him doing nothing but praying all night, you could see
him doing that, or doing nothing but sleeping, you could see him doing that
as well."

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Shaytan ties three
knots at the back of your heads when you are asleep. He hits every knot with
the words, 'You have a long night ahead of you so sleep tight.' When you
wake up and remember Allah, one knot is undone. When you do <I>wudu'</I>,
one knot is undone. When you pray, one knot is undone. So morning finds you
cheerful and energetic. Otherwise, morning finds you lazy and foul-tempered.'"
<P>

anything of Me that I may give it to him? Is there anyone asking forgiveness
of Me that I may forgive him?'"

</I>during Ramadan or at any other time. He would pray fou<I>r rak'ats</I>
- do not ask about their beauty or length - and then he would pray four more
- and do not ask about their beauty or length - and then he would pray three."

<P>
1097. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I did not see the Prophet, may Allah

Your body has a right on you and your family has a right on you, so fast
and break your fast and pray and then sleep.'"

His is the praise. He has power over everything. Praise belongs to Allah.
Glory be to Allah. There is no god but Allah. Allah is greater. There is
no strength nor power except by Allah,' and then says, 'O Allah, forgive
me' or makes supplication to Allah,' it will be answered. If he does
<I>wudu'</I>, then his prayer will be accepted."
<P>
1104. It is related from Abu Hurayra in one of his stories when he was mentioning
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Your brother,
meaning 'Abdullah ibn Rawaha, does not come out with lewdness:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'Among us is the Messenger of Allah who recites His Book
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; as the sun appears shining at daybreak.
  <P>
  He brought guidance after our blindness, and so our hearts
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; are certain that what he says will take place.
  <P>
  He spends the night, his side shunning his bed, while
  <P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; the idolaters beds hold them in deepest sleep.'"

I saw two people who came to me and wanted to take me to the Fire. An angel
met us and said, 'Do not be alarmed. Leave him.' Hafsa related one of my
dreams to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ''Abdullah is an excellent
man. If only he would pray at night!'" Nafi' said, "So 'Abdullah then used
to pray at night. They used to tell the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, their dreams that (the Night of Power) was on the

say, 'O Allah, I ask You for the best by Your knowledge and I ask You for
strength by Your power and I ask You for some of Your immense bounty. You
have power and I do not. You know and I do not. You are the Knower of the
Unseen worlds. O Allah, if You know that this matter is good for me in my
deen and my livelihood and the end of my affair (or he said, 'my affair sooner
and later'), then ordain it for me and make it easy for me and then bless
me in it. If You know that this matter is bad for me in my deen and my livelihood
and the end of my affair (or he said, 'my affair sooner and later'), then

say, 'I used to lead my people in prayer at Banu Salim and there was a river-bed
between me and them. When the rains came, it was difficult for me to cross
it to get to their mosque. So I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said to him, "Messenger of Allah, my eyesight
is weak and when it rains, the water floods the river-bed between me and
them so that I am unable to get to their mosque and lead them in the prayer.
Messenger of Allah, I would very much like you to come and pray in my house
so that I could take it as a prayer-place." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "I will do that." The following day
when the sun was well up, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and Abu Bakr came and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, asked for permission to enter and I gave him
permission. He did not sit down when he entered the house but said, "Where
in your house would you like me to pray." I pointed out to him the place
where I wanted to pray. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, stood and said the <I>takbir</I>, and we formed rows behind him.
He prayed two<I> rak'ats</I> and then said the <I>taslim</I> and we said
the taslim when he did. I persuaded him stay with us to eat a dish of
<I>khazira</I> [meat soup] which had been prepared for him. The people of
the area heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was in our house and quite a number of their men gathered in the
house and one of them said, "What has happened to Malik? I do not see him."
Another of them said, "That man is a hypocrite who does not love Allah and
His Messenger." The Messenger of Allah* said, "Do not say that. Do you not
see that he has said, 'There is no god but Allah,' desiring by that nothing
but the face of Allah?" The man said, "Allah and His Messenger know best,
but, by Allah, we have only seen him loving and advising the hypocrites."
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Allah
has forbidden the Fire for anyone who says 'There is no god but Allah' desiring
by that the face of Allah." ' "
<P>
Mahmud said, "I related this to some people, one of whom was Abu Ayyub, the
Companion of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
in the expedition in which he died, and over which Yazid ibn Mu'awiya had
command, in Byzantine territory. Abu Ayyub objected to me saying it and said,
'By Allah, I do not think that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, ever said what you said.' That was hard for me to endure
and I vowed to Allah that if I was spared, I would return from that expedition
to ask 'Itban ibn Malik about it if I found him still alive in the mosque
of his people. So I returned and put on ihram for hajj or 'umra and then
travelled until I reached Madina. I went to the Banu Salim and 'Itban was
an old blind man who still led his people in the prayer. When he said the
<I>taslim</I> for the prayer, I greeted him and told him who I was and then
asked him about that <I>hadith</I>. He related it to me as he had related
it the first time."

on two occasions: the day he arrived in Makka - and he used to arrive in
Makka in the morning and do tawaf of the House and then pray tw<I>o rak'ats
</I>behind the <I>Maqam</I> - and when he visited the mosque of Quba' which
he used to do every Saturday. When he entered the mosque he disliked leaving
it without having prayed in it. He related that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to visit it both riding and on
foot. He used to say, "I do as I saw my companions doing and I do not forbid
anyone to pray at any hour he wishes in the day or night, although one should
not intend to pray at the rising or setting of the sun."

on a two day journey except with her husband or a <I>mahram</I>. There is
no fasting on two days: the Day of <I>Fitr</I> and that of <I>al-Adha</I>.
There is no prayer after two prayers: after <I>Subh</I> until the sun rises
and afte<I>r 'Asr </I>until the sun sets. And there should be no special
journey except to three mosques: the Masjid al-Haram, the Masjid al-Aqsa
and my mosque."
