Book of <I>Riqaq</I> (<I>Hadiths</I> which produce mercyin the heart)</BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><P><B>I. What has come about health and leisure and that there is no life exceptthat of the Next World</B><P>6049. Ibn Abi Hind related from his father from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There are two blessings inwhich many people suffer loss: health and leisure."<P>Another <I>isnad</I> in which he said, "I heard Ibn 'Abbas say from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,..."<P>6050. Mu'awiya ibn Qurra related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "O Allah, there is no life except the lifeof the Next World, so make peace between the Ansar and Muhajirun."<P>6051. Abu Hazim related that Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi said, "We were withthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the Battleof the Ditch. He was dfgging while we were carrying the earth. He lookedat us and said, 'O Allah, there is no life except the life of the Next World,so forgive the Ansar and Muhajirun.'"<P>Sahl ibn Sa'd corroborated the like of it from the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace.<P><P><B>II. The example of this world in relation to the Next World.</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"Know that the life of this world is merelya game and a diversion and ostentation and a cause of boasting among yourselvesand trying to outdo one another in wealth and children: like the plant-growthafter rain which delights the cultivators, but then it withers and you seeit turning yellow, and then it becomes broken stubble. In the Next Worldthere is terrible punishment but also forgiveness from Allah and His goodpleasure. The life of this world is nothing but the enjoyment of delusion."</I>(57:20)<P>6052. Abu Hazim related that Sahl said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'The place of a whip in theGarden us better than this world and what it contains. A morning in the Wayof Allah or an evening is better than this world and what it contains."<P><P><B>III. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"Be in this world as you were a stranger or someone passing through"</B><P>6053. Mujahid related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took hold of me and said, 'Be inthis world as if you were a stranger or a someone passing through.'" Ibn'Umar used to say, "In the evening, do not anticipate the morning, and inthe morning do not anticipate the evening. Take from your health for yourillness and from your life for your death."<P><P><B>IV. On hope and too much of it</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Anyone who is distanced from the Fire andadmitted to the Garden has triumphed. The life of this world is just theenjoyment of delusion." </I>(3:185)<P>He says, <I>"Leave them to eat and enjoy themselves. Let false hope divertthem. They will soon know." </I>(15:3)<P>'Ali ibn Abi Talib said, "This world is retreating and the Next World isadvancing. Each of the two has sons. Be among the sons of the Next Worldand do not be among the sons of this world. Today there is action withoutreckoning and tomorrow there will be reckoning and no action."<P><I>"Bi-muzahzihihi" </I>(save him) (2:96) means "far from it."<P>6054. Rabi' ibn Khuthaym related that 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, drew a square and then drew a linein the middle of it which extended beyond it. He drew some small lines upto this middle line from the side within the square and said, 'This is man,and this is end of his lifespan which encircles him - or by which he is encircled- and this which goes beyond it is his hope and these small lines are thingsthat happen. If this one misses him, that one gets him, and if that one misseshim, this one gets him.'"<P>6055. Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, drewsome lines and said, 'This is man and this is end of his lifespan. That ishow he is when this nearest line comes upon him.'"<P><P><B>V. If someone reaches the age of sixty, Allah has left him no excuse [forwrong actions] in life </B><P>Allah says, <I>"Did We not let you live long enough for anyone who was goingto pay heed to pay heed? And did the warner not come to you?"</I> (35:37)meaning white hair.<P>6056. Sa'id ibn Abi Sa'id al-Maqburi related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah has left no excusefor a man whose time of death is deferred until he reaches the age of sixty."<P>Abu Hazim and Ibn 'Ajlan corroborated it from al-Maqburi.<P>6057. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'The heart of anold man remains young in two things: love of this world and excessive hope.'"<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Ibn Shihab from Sa'id and Abu Salama.<P>6058. Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The son of Adam grows old andtwo grow old with him: love of this world and long life." Shu'ba relatedit from Qatada.<P><P><B>VI. The action which is done for the sake of Allah</B><P>Sa'd is in it.<P>6059. Az-Zuhri related from Mahmud ibn ar-Rabi', and Mahmud claimed thathe had received from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, a mouthful from a bucket in their house. He said, "I heard 'Itbanibn Malik al-Ansari who was then one of the Banu Salim, say, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to me and said, 'Ifa person comes on the Day of Rising who says, 'There is no god but Allah.'desiring the face of Allah by it, Allah will forbid him to the Fire."<P>6060. Sa'id al-Maqburi related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty says, 'Mybelieving slave has no repayment but the Garden when his dear one among thepeople of this world is taken and he remains steadfast."<P><P><B>VII. Warning about the beauty of this world and vying for it</B><P>6061. Al-Miswar ibn Makhrama related that 'Amr ibn 'Awf, the ally of theBanu 'Amir ibn Lu'ayy and one of those who had been present at Badr withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reported that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah toBahrayn to bring their <I>jizya</I>. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, had made a truce with the people of Bahrayn andappointed al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami as their governor. Abu 'Ubayda broughtthe money from Bahrayn and the Ansar heard of the arrival of Abu 'Ubaydawhich was at the time of the Subh prayer with the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. When he finished, they presented themselves beforehim and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,smiled when he saw them. He said, 'I think you must have heard that Abu 'Ubaydahas arrived with something?' They said, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He said,'Rejoice, and hope for what will gladden you. By Allah, it is not povertythat I fear for you, but I fear that this world will be spread out in frontof you as it was spread out in front of those before you, and then you willvie for it as they vied for it, and it will destroy you as it destroyed them.'"<P>6062. Abu'l-Khayr related from 'Uqba ibn 'Amir, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, went out one day and prayed over the people of Uhudwith the prayer for the dead. Then he went to the minbar and said, 'I willprepare things for you and will be a witness for you. By Allah, I see myBasin now and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth (orthe keys of the earth). By Allah, I do not fear for you that you will associateanything with Allah after me, but I fear for you that you will fight oneanother for them.'"<P>6063. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "What I fear foryou is that the blessings of the earth will become abundant for you." Itwas asked, "What are the blessings of the earth?" He said, "The attractionsof this world." A man asked him, "Can good bring evil?" The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was silent until I thought that he wasbeing given revelation. Then he wiped the sweat from his brow and said, "Whereis the one asked the question?" "Me," he said. Abu Sa'id said, "We praisedhim when he raised that." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "Good only brings good. This property is sweet and green. Itis like that which grows on the water course and nearly kills or nearly killsby bloating. The animal eats the plants until its sides are full and thenit faces the sun and defecates and urinates and then grazes. This wealthis sweet. If someone takes it properly and spends it properly, it is an excellenthelper. If someone takes it improperly, he is like the one who eats and doesnot become full."<P>6064. Zahdam ibn Mudarrib said, "I heard 'Imran ibn Husayn report that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The best of youare my generation and then those who follow them and then those who followthem.' 'Imran said, 'I do not know whether the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said it twice or three times.' 'Then after them willcome a people who betray and are not trustworthy, who testify when they arenot asked to testify, and who make a vow and do not fulfil it. Fleshinesswill appear among them."<P>6065. 'Abida related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "The best of people are those of my generation,then those who follow them and then those who follow them. After them willcome a people whose testimony precedes their oaths and whose oaths precedetheir testimony."<P>6066. Qays said, "I heard Khabbab when he had been cauterised seven timeson his abdomen. He said, 'If it had not been that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade us to pray for death, Iwould have prayed for it. The Companions of Muhammad, have gone and thisworld did not cause them any decrease. We have acquired so much that theonly way to spend it is in constructing buildings [lit. on earth].'"<P>6067. Qays said, "I went to Khabbab while he was building a wall and he said,"Our Companions have gone and this world did not cause them any decrease.We have acquired so much after them that we find no place for it except inconstructing buildings [lit. on earth]."<P>6068. It is related from Abu Wa'il that Khabbab said, "We emigrated withthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace ... the story."<P><P><B>VIII. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Mankind! Allah's promise is true.Do not let the life of this world delude you and do not let the Deluder deludeyou about Allah. Shaytan is your enemy so treat him as an enemy. He summonshis party so they will be among the people of the Searing Blaze."</I>(35:5-6)</B><P>Its plural is <I>su'ur</I>. Mujahid said that <I>Gharur</I> (the Deluder)is Shaytan.<P>6069. Ibn Aban reported, "I went to 'Uthman ibn 'Affan with his water forpurification while he was sitting at al-Maqa'id. He did wudu' and did itwudu' well. Then he said, 'I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, doing wudu', while he was in this gathering. He did an excellentwudu' and then said, 'Whoever does wudu' like this and then prays two rak'atsand then sits will have his past sins forgiven.' The Prophet , may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not be deluded.'"<P>[al-Maqa'id is a place in Madina.]<P><P><B>IX. The departure of the righteous</B><P><I>Dhahab</I> is used for rain.<P>6070. Qays ibn Abi Hazim related from Mirdas al-Aslami that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The righteous will disappearone by one until only the dregs remain like the dregs of barley or datesand Allah will not care about them at all."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that one can say <I>hufala</I> or <I>huthala</I> (dregs).<P><P><B>X. The affliction of wealth about which one should be careful</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Your wealth and children are a trial."</I>(64:15)<P>6071. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "May the slave of the dinar andthe dirham, the <I>qatifa</I> (outer garment) and <I>khamisa</I> (wrap) perish!If he is given them he is pleased, and if he is not given them he is notpleased."<P>6072. 'Ata' related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, say, "If the son of Adam had two valleys ofwealth, he would want a third. The belly of the son of Adam will only befilled by earth. Allah turns to whoever turns in repentance to Him."<P>6073. 'Ata' related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, say, 'If the son of Adam had possessed a valleyof wealth, he would want to have another. The eye of the son of Adam is onlyfilled by earth. Allah turns to whoever turns in repentance to Him.'"<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, I do not know whether it is part of the Qur'an or not."<P>He said, "I heard Ibn az-Zubayr say that on the minbar."<P>6074. 'Abbas ibn Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "I heard Ibn az-Zubayr giving a khutbaon the minbar in Makka, saying, 'O people, the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, used to say, "If the son of Adam had possessed a valleyof filled with gold, he would want a second. If he were to be given a second,he would want a third. The belly of the son of Adam will only be filled byearth. Allah turns to whoever turns in repentance to Him."'"<P>6075. Ibn Shihab said that Anas ibn Malik reported to him that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If the son of Adamhad a valley of gold, he would want two valleys. His mouth will only be filledby dust. Allah turns to whoever turns in repentance to Him.'"<P>Another isnad from Anas from Ubayy who said, "We used to think that thiswas part of the Qur'an until there was revealed, <I>'Fierce competition forthis world distracted you...'</I> (102:1) was revealed."<P><P><B>XI. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"This wealth is green and sweet."</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"To mankind the love of worldly appetites ispainted in glowing colours: women and children, and heaped-up mounds of goldand silver, and horses with fine markings, and livestock and fertile farmland.All that is merely the enjoyment of the life of this world." </I>(3:14)<P>'Umar said, O Allah, we can only be happy with what You have made seen fairto us. O Allah, I ask You to make me spend it properly."<P>6076. 'Urwa and Sa'id ibn a-Musayyab related that Hakim ibn Hizam said, "Iasked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he gave tome. Then I asked him again and he gave to me, and then I asked him yet againand he gave to me. Then he said, 'This wealth is...' (Sufyan may have said),He said to me, 'Hakim, this wealth is green and sweet. Whoever takes it witha generous soul will be blessed in it. Whoever takes it with avarice is notblessed in it. He is like the one who eats and is not filled. The upper handis better than the lower hand.'"<P><P><B>XII. What one has already spent of his wealth is his</B><P>6077. Al-Harith ibn Suwayd reported from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Who among you considers the wealthof his heir dearer to him than his own wealth?" They answered, "Messengerof Allah, there is none among us who does not love his own wealth more."He said, "His wealth is what he has sent ahead and the wealth of his heiris what he leaves."<P><P><B>XIII. Those who have a lot (in this world) will have little (reward) </B><P>The words of the Almighty,<I> "As for those who desire the life of this worldand its finery, We will give them full payment in it for their actions. Theywill not be deprived here of their due. But such people will have nothingin the Next World but the Fire. What they achieved here will come to nothing.What they did will prove to be null and void."</I> (11:15-16)<P>6078. Zayd ibn Wahb related that Abu Dharr said, "I went out one night andthere was the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,walking alone with no one with him. I thought that he did not want to havesomeone walk with him, so I began to walk in the shade of the moonlight.He turned and saw me and said, 'Who is it?' 'Abu Dharr,' I replied, 'MayAllah let me be your ransom!' He said, 'Come, Abu Dharr!' I walked with himfor a time and then he said, 'Those who have a lot (in this world) will havelittle (reward) on the Day of Rising except for someone to whom Allah giveswealth and he gives it to his right, left, in front of him and behind him,and does good deeds with it.' I walked with him for some time and then hesaid to me, 'Sit here. He made me sit on a flat place surrounded by rocks.He told me, 'Stay where you are until I come back to you.' He went in theHarra until I could no longer see him. He remained away from me for a longtime and then I heard him saying while he was coming, 'Even if he stealsand even if he fornicates.' When he came, I cold not remain patient withoutsaying, 'Prophet of Allah - May Allah let me be your ransom! &#150; who wereyou speaking to when you came from the Harra?' I did not hear anyone answeringyou at all.' He said, 'That was Jibril, peace be upon him. He appeared tome beside the Harra and said, "Give your community the good news that whoeverdies without associating anything with Allah will enter the Garden." I said,"O Jibril, even if he steals and even if he fornicates?" "Yes," he answered.I said, 'Even if he steals and even if he fornicates?' He said, 'Yes, evenif he drinks wine.'"<P>Another isnad from Zayd ibn Wahb with the same.<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that the hadith of Abu Salih is <I>mursal</I> fromAbu'd-Darda' and not sound. We meant to inform about it and the sound oneis the hadith of Abu Dharr.<P>Abu 'Abdullah was asked about the hadith of 'Ata' ibn Yasar from Abu'd-Darda',He said, 'It is <I>mursal</I> and not sound. The sound one is the hadithof Abu Dharr." He said, "Leave this hadith of Abu'd-Darda', 'When he died,he said 'There is no god but Allah' when he died."<P><P><B>XIV. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"It would not make me happy to have the like of this mountain of Uhud ingold."</B><P>6079. Zayd ibn Wahb related that Abu Dharr said, "I was walking with theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the Harra of Madinain the evening and Uhud was in front of us. He said, 'Abu Dharr, It wouldnot make me happy to have the amount of Uhud in gold then have any of itremain with me for more than three days except a dinar I might keep for payingdebts. I would say that it is for the servants of Allah: so-and-so, so-and-so,and so-and-so,' gesturing to his right, left and behind him. He continuedto walk said then said, 'Those who have a lot (in this world) will have little(reward) in the Rising except for someone who spends his money here and there,'gesturing to his right, left and behind him. Then he said to me, 'Stay whereyou are and do not leave until I come back.' He went until into the darknessof the night until he disappeared from my sight. I heard a voice raised andfeared that someone might have accosted the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace. I wanted to go and then I remembered that he had toldme, "Stay where you are and do not leave until I come back." I stayed putuntil he came to me. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I heard a voice and wasafraid.' I mentioned that to him. He said, 'Did you hear him?' 'Yes,' I said.He said, 'That was Jibril. He came to me and told me, "Any of my communitywho die without associating anything with Allah will enter the Garden."'I said, 'Even if he fornicates and even if he steals?' He said, 'Even ifhe fornicates and even if he steals.'"<P>6080. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba related from Abu Hurayra that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If Iwere to have the amount of Uhud in gold, it would not make me happy to haveany of it remain with me for more than three days except for something whichI might keep for paying debts."<P><P><B>XV. Wealth is the independence of the self</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"Do they imagine that, in the wealth and childrenWe extend to them, We are hastening to them with good things? No indeed,but they have no awareness! Those who are filled with the fear of their Lord,those who have iman in the Signs of their Lord, those who do not associateanything with their Lord, those who give what they have given, their heartsfearful of their return to their Lord, such people are truly racing towardsgood things, and they are the first to reach them. We do not impose on anyself any more than it can stand. With Us there is a Book which speaks theTruth. They will not be wronged. However, their hearts are overwhelmed byignorance about this matter and they do other things as well."</I> (23:55-63)<P>Ibn 'Uyayna said, "They have not done it, but they must do it."<P>6081. Abu Salih related that Abu Hurayra said, "Wealth is not from a lotof money. Wealth is the independence of the self."<P><P><B>XVI. The excellence of poverty</B><P>6082. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi said, "A man passed by theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who said toa man who was sitting with him, 'What do you think of this man?' He said,'A man from the nobles of the people. By Allah, he is such that if he proposesmarriage, his proposal is accepted, and if he intercedes his intercessionwould be granted.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was silent and then another man passed and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'What do think about thisman?' He said, 'Messenger of Allah, this is one of the poor Muslims. He issuch that if he were to propose marriage, his proposal would not be worthaccepting, and if he were to intercede, his intercession would not be granted,and if he were to speak, his words would not be listened to.' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'This one is betterthan the whole earth full of the first one.'"<P>6083. Abu Wa'il said, "We visited Khabbab and he said, 'We emigrated withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, seeking the face ofAllah, and our reward was up to Allah. Some of us have gone without takingany of his reward, and Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr was one of them. He was killed inthe Battle of Uhud and left a cloak. When we covered his head with it, hisfeet showed, and if we covered his feet, his head showed. So the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered us to cover hishead and we put some idhhir-herb over his feet. Some of us have had its fruitsripen for him in this world and he is harvesting them.'"<P>6084. Abu Raja' related from 'Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "I looked at the Garden and I saw thatmost of its people were the poor. I looked at the Fire and I saw that mostof its people were women."<P>It is corroborated by Ayyub and 'Awf. Sakhr and Hammad ibn Najih relatedit from Abu Raja' from Ibn 'Abbas.<P>6085. Qatada related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, did not eat off a table up until the time he died, and hedid not eat fine bread up until the time he died."<P>6086. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, died, there was nothing in my housethat could be eaten by a living creature except for half a barley loaf ona shelf. I ate from it until I seemed to have had it for a long time. ThenI measured it and it finished." "<P><P><B>XVII. What the life of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and his Companions was like and their divesting themselves of thisworld</B><P>6087. Mujahid related that Abu Hurayra said, "By Allah. There is no god butHim, I used to lie on my stomach on the ground out of hunger and I used totie a stone to my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by road by whichpeople went out. Abu Bakr passed by and I asked him about an ayat of theBook of Allah and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger. Hepassed by and did not do it. Then 'Umar passed by and I asked him about anayat of the Book of Allah and I only asked him so that he would satisfy myhunger. He passed by and did not do it. Then Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, passed by and he smiled when he saw me and recognisedwhat was inside of me and what was in my face. He said, 'Abu Hirr!' I answered,'At your service, Messenger of Allah!' He said, 'Come along.' He went andI followed him. He went inside and I asked permission to enter and he gaveme permission. He entered and found some milk in a bowl and said, 'Whereis this milk from?' They said, 'It was given to you by so-and-so (eithera man or a woman). He said, 'Abu Hirr!' I answered, 'At your service, Messengerof Allah!' He said, 'Go and invite the people of the Suffa for me.' The peopleof the Suffa were the guests of Islam who no family, property or anythingto resort to. When sadaqa came, he used to send it to them and not take anyof it. When a gift came to him, he would sent some and take some and letthem share in it. That annoyed me and I said (to myself), 'What good willthis milk be among the people of the Suffa?' I thought that I was more entitledto have a drink of this milk to strengthen myself thereby, but then he cameand ordered to give it to them and I wondered if I would get any of thismilk. But Allah and His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,must be obeyed.'<P>"I went to the people of the Suffa and invited them and they accepted. Theyasked permission to enter and he gave them permission. They took their seatsin the house and he said, 'Abu Hirr!' I answered, 'At your service, Messengerof Allah!' He said, 'Take it and give to them.' I took the bowel and gaveit to a man who drank his fill and then returned the bowl to me. Then I gaveit to another man who drank his fill and then returned the bowl to me. Anotherdrank until he was full and then returned the bowl to me.until I reachedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after all the grouphad drunk their fill. He took the bowl and put it in his hand. Then he lookedat me and smiled and said, 'Abu Hirr!' I answered, 'At your service, Messengerof Allah!' He said, 'You and I remain.' I said, 'You spoke the truth, Messengerof Allah. 'Sit and drink,' he said. I sat and drank. He said, "Drink.' SoI drank. He continued to say 'Drink' until I said, 'No, by the One who sentyou with the truth, I have no room for it!' He said, 'Give it to me.' I gavehim the bowl and he praised Allah, said the name of Allah and drank the rest."<P>6088. It is related that Qays said, "I heard Sa'd say, 'I was the first ofthe Arabs to shoot an arrow in the way of Allah. I remember us going on raidswhen we had no food except he leaves of the Hubla tree and this acacia. Oneof us would pass something like sheep droppings which were unmixed. And nowthe Banu Aslam criticise me regarding {my knowledge of] Islam. I will havelost if my actions come to nothing.'"<P>6089.

'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "A month would pass in which we didnot light a fire. Our food was dates and water unless we were given somemeat."<P>6094. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said to 'Urwa, "Son of my sister, we usedto see three crescent moons in two months without there being a fire litin the houses of the Messenger of Allah." He said, "I said, 'What did yousurvive on?' She said, 'The two black ones - dates and water. However, theMessenger of Allah* had some neighbours of the Ansar who had sheep whichwere lent to them for milking and they used to give the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, some of their drink and he wouldlet us drink.'"<P>6095.

I have never such goodand evil as I have seen today."<P><P><B>XIX. Hope and fear</B><P>Sufyan said, "There is no ayat in the Qur'an harder for me than <I>"You havenothing to stand on until you implement the Torah and the Injil and whathas been sent down to you from your Lord." </I>(5:68)<P>6104. Sa'id ibn Abi Sa'id al-Maqburi related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heardthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Allahcreated mercy on the day He created it as a hundred mercies. He kept ninety-ninemercies with him and sent one part to all His creation. If the unbelieverhad known of all the mercy that is with Allah, He would not have despairedof the Garden. If the believer knew of all the punishment which Allah has,he would not feel safe from the Fire."<P><P><B>XX. Steadfastness in refraining from what Allah has forbidden</B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"The steadfast will be paid their wages infull without any reckoning."</I> (39:10)<P>'Umar said, "We found that the best of life was when we were patient."<P>6105. 'Ata' ibn Yazid al-Laythi reported that he had been informed by AbuSa'id al-Khudri that some of the Ansar asked the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, (for something), and he gave to allof those who asked him until what he had with him was finished. When he hadspent all that was in his hands, he said, "If I had anything more, I wouldnot withhold it from you. Whoever refrains, Allah will spare him from needingto ask. Whoever shows fortitude, Allah will increase him in it. Whoever wantsto be independent, Allah will make him so. No one can be given any betterand greater gift than fortitude.'"<P>6106. Ziyad ibn 'Ilaqa reported that the heard al-Mughira ibn Sha'ba say,"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray untilhis feet swelled up or bloated.

It is related that Warrad, the scribe of al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba thatMu'awiya wrote to al-Mughira, "Write for me a hadith which you heard fromthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." He said,"Al-Mughira wrote to Mu'awiya, 'I heard him say when he finished the prayer,"There is no god but Allah alone with no partner. The kingdom and praisebelong to Him and He has power over all things' three times." He said, 'Healso used to forbid chitchat, asking a lot of questions, wasting money, refusingto fulfil your obligations and taking what is not lawfully yours, disobedienceto your mothers, and burying your daughters alive.'"<P>Another <I>isnad</I> of this <I>hadith</I> from Warrad from al-Mughira fromthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>XXIII. Guarding the tongue</B><P>The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Whoeverbelieves in Allah and the Last Day should speak what is good or be silent."<P>The Almighty says, <I>"He does not utter a single word, without a watcherby him, pen in hand!" </I>(50:18)<P>6109. Abu Hazim related from Sahl ibn Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever can guarantee forme what is between his jaw and what is between his legs, I will guaranteehim the Garden."<P>6110. Abu Salama related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah said,"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak what is good orbe silent.

Abu Shurayh al-Khuza'i said, "My ears heard and my heart retained thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Hospitalityis for three days it is his due." It was asked, "What is his due?" He said,"A night and day, Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should honourhis guest. Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak what isgood or be silent."<P>6112. 'Isa ibn Talha at-Taymi related that Abu Hurayra heard the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, ""A slave of Allah might saysomething, without realising its seriousness, which causes him to slip intothe Fire by a greater margin than the distance between the east and the west."<P>6113. Abu Salih related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "A person may speak a word which pleases Allahwithout paying any attention to it by which Allah elevates someone by degrees.A person may speak a word which angers Allah without paying any attentionto it by which he falls into Jahannam."<P><P><B>XXIV. Weeping out fear of Allah</B><P>6114.

Fear of Allah</B><P>6115. Rib'i related from Hudhayfa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "A man among the people before you had a had opinionabout his actions and so he said to his family, 'When I die, take me andscatter my ashes in the sea on a windy day.' They did that and Allah gatheredhim and then said, 'What made you do what you did?' He answered. 'I was onlymoved to do that out of fear of you.' So he forgave him."<P>6116. 'Uqba ibn 'Abdu'l-Ghafir related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mentioned a man from thosebefore or the previous generations to whom Allah gave wealth and children.He said, "When he was close to death, he asked his sons, 'What sort of fatherhave I been to you?' 'The best father.' they answered. He said, "But he hasnot stored? up any good with Allah." (Qatada said that it means stored up.)When he faces Allah, Allah will punish him. Listen, when I die, burn me untilI am charcoal and then grind me up (or turn me into dust). When there isa strong wind, scatter me in it.' He made them commit themselves to thatand swear by Allah to it. They did it and Allah said, 'Be!' Then he was thereas a man standing upright. Then He said, 'My slave, what moved you to dowhat you did?' 'Fear of You (Or alarm about You),' he answered. Only themercy of Allah met him."<P>It is related that Salman added, "Scatter me in the sea" or the like of that.<P>Another isnad from 'Uqba from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri from the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>XXVI. Ceasing acts of disobedience</B><P>6117. Abu Burda related from Abu Musa that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "My example and that of the what Allahsent me with is like a man who comes to some people and says, 'I have seenthe army with my own eyes. I am naked warner. Save yourselves! Save yourselves!'One group obey him and leave at the beginning of the night, slowly and carefully,and are saved. Another group deny him and the army comes on them in the morningand destroys them."<P>6118. 'Abdu'r-Rahman related that he heard Abu Hurayra say that he heardthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Themetaphor of me and people is like a man who lights a fire and when it lightsup what is around it, the moths and these creatures begin to fall into it.He begins to drive them away from it, but they overpower him and rush intoit. I take hold of the knots of your waist-wrappers to keep you back fromthe Fire while you are rushing into it."<P>6119. 'Amir reported that he heard 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr say that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Muslim is the one fromwhose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe. The emigrant is the one who shunswhat Allah has forbidden."<P><P><B>XXVII.

Musa ibn Anas related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "If you knew what I know, you would laugh littleand weep much."<P><P><B>XXVIII. The Fire is veiled by appetites</B><P>6122. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Fire is veiled by appetitesand the Garden is veiled by disliked things."<P><P><B>XXIX. "The Garden is closer to one of you than the strap of his sandal,and the same is true of the Fire</B><P>6123.

Abu Salama related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "The truest verse that the poet said is:"Everything except Allah is false.'"<P><P><B>XXX.

Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When one of you looks at onewho is better than him in wealth and physique, he should look at one whois less than him."<P><P><B>XXXI. The one who intended to do a good deed or evil deed</B><P>6126. Abu Raja' al-'Utaridi related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, related from His Mighty and MajesticLord, "Allah has written good deeds and evil deeds and then made that clear.Whoever wants to do a good action and then does not do it, Allah writes forhim with Him one full good deed. If he intends it and does it, Allah writesfor him with Him from ten full deeds to 700 to many times more. Whoever intendsan evil deed and does not do it. Allah writes for him a good deed with Him.If he intends it and does it then Allah writes one evil action for Him."<P><P><B>XXXII. What minor wrong actions one should be careful about</B><P>6127. Ghaylan related that Anas said, "You do actions which are smaller thana hair in your eyes whereas in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, we used to consider them to be among the grave sins."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that he meant destructive major wrong actions.<P><P><B>XXXIII. Actions depend on seals and what is feared in that</B><P>6128. Abu Hazim related that Sahl ibn Sa'id as-Sa'idi said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked a man who was fighting againstthe idolaters and he was one of the boldest fighters among the Muslims. Hesaid, 'Whoever wants to look at a man of the people of the Fire should lookat this man." One man followed him and he continued like that until he waswounded and then he hastened his death by placing the hilt on his sword inthe earth and point at his breast and then he fell on it so that it emergesthrough his shoulders. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "A man can do the actions of the people of the Garden in what he showsto people, while he is one of the people of the Fire, and a man can do theactions of the people of the Fire in what he shows to people, while he isone of the people of the Garden. Actions are according to their seals."<P><P><B>XXXIV. Seclusion provides rest from evil companions</B><P>6129. 'Ata' ibn Yazid related that Abu Sa'id said, "It was said, 'O Messengerof Allah...'"<P>'Ata' ibn Yazid al-Laythi related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "A bedouincame to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,'Messenger of Allah, which is the best of people?' He answered, 'A man whostrives with his person and his property and a man in one of the ravineswho worships his Lord and saves people from his evil.'"<P>Az-Zubaydi, Sulayman ibn Kathir and an-Nu'man corroborated it from az-Zuhri.<P>Az-Zuhri related it from 'Ata' or 'Ubaydullah from Abu Sa'id from the Prophet*.<P>It is related from Ibn Shihab from 'Ata' from one of the Companions of theProphet, from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>6130. Abu Sa'sa'a related that he heard Abu Sa'id al-Khudri say, "I heardthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "A time will comeon people when the best property of a Muslim man is some sheep which he takesto the tops of mountains and places of rainfall, fleeing with his deen fromtrials."<P><P><B>XXXV. The removal of trustworthiness</B><P>6131. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When trustworthiness is lost,then expect the Hour to come." He said, "How can it be lost, Messenger ofAllah?" He said, "When authority is given to those who are not worthy ofit, then expect the Hour."<P>6132. Zayd ibn Hudhayl related that Hudhayfa said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, related two <I>hadiths</I> to us.I have seen one of them come about and am still waiting for the other. [Hesaid, 'Trustworthiness had descended into the very hearts of men. Then theQur'an descended and they knew it from the Qur'an and they knew it from the<I>Sunna</I>.'<P>"Then he related to us about its removal and said, 'A man will go to sleepand trustworthiness will be taken from his heart and its trace will remainlike a small mark. Then he will go to sleep and trustworthiness will be takenfrom his heart and its trace will remain like a weal, as when an ember rollsonto his foot and it blisters up and you see it raised up with nothing init. And people will continue to trade but practically no one will fulfilhis trust, to such a point that it will be said, "There is a trustworthyman among the Banu so-and-so!" and until it will be said of a man, "How toughhe is! How elegant! How intelligent!" when he does not have a mustard-grainof belief in his heart.'<P>"There was a time when I did not care who I did business with. If he wasa Muslim, his deen was sufficient assurance for me, and if he was a Christianor a Jew, his guardian was sufficient assurance for me. Today I only do businesswith so-and-so and so-and-so among you."<P>Another <I>isnad</I> in which it says, "into the very hearts of men.""<I>Jadhr</I>" refers to the basic root of anything. <I>Wakt</I> is the slighttrace of something, <I>Majl</I> is the effect of work on the hand when itis hard.<P>6133. Salim ibn 'Abdullah related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I heardthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Peopleare like camels. Out of a hundred you can scarcely find one mount."<P><P><B>XXXVI. Showing off and Reputation</B><P>6134. It is related from Salama ibn Kuhayl...<P>Salama related that he heard Jundub say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "I have not heard anyone say, 'The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said' to someone else but that I drewnear him and heard him say, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'If someone does something for the sake of reputation, Allahwill let the people know of it. If someone shows off, Allah will show himoff."<P><P><B>XXXVII. The one who strives with himself to obey Allah</B><P>6135. Anas ibn Malik related that Mu'adh ibn Jabal said, "While I was ridingbehind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with nothingbetween me and him except the back of the saddle, he said, 'Mu'adh!' 'Atyour service and obedience, Messenger of Allah,' I answered. Then he travelledfor some time and then said again, 'Mu'adh!' I answered again, 'At your serviceand obedience, Messenger of Allah.' Then he travelled for some time and againsaid, 'Mu'adh ibn Jabal!' 'At your service and obedience, Messenger of Allah,'I answered. He said, 'Do you know what is Allah's right on His slaves?' 'Allahand His Messenger know best,' I answered. He said, 'Allah's right on Hisslaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him.'Then he travelled for a time and then said, 'Mu'adh ibn Jabal!' 'At yourservice and obedience, Messenger of Allah,' I answered. He said, 'Do youknow what is the right of the slaves on Allah if they do that?' 'Allah andHis Messenger know best,' I answered. He said, 'The slaves' right on Allahis that He will not punish them.'"<P><P><B>XXXVIII. Humility</B><P>6136. Humayd related from Anas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, had a she-camel..."<P>Humayd at-Tawil related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, had a she-camel called al-'Adba' which could not bebeaten in a race. A bedouin came on a youngish camel and beat it. That wasdifficult for the Muslims and, recognising that, he said, 'It is a rightof Allah that nothing elevates itself in this world, without Him then bringingit low."<P>6137. 'Ata' related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah said: 'I have declaredwar on anyone who shows enmity to a friend of Mine. My slave does not drawnear to Me with anything I love more than what I have made obligatory onhim. And my slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory actionsuntil I love him. When I love him, I become his hearing with which he hears,his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his footwith which he walks. If he were to ask Me for something, I would give itto him. If he were to ask Me for refuge, I would give him refuge. I do nothesitate in anything I do as I hesitate to take the soul of the believerwho dislikes death and I disliked to annoy him.'"<P><P><B>XXXIX. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"I have been sent when I and the Final Hour are like this..</B>."<P><I>"The matter of the Hour is only the blink of an eye away, or even nearer.Allah has power over all things." </I>(16:77)<P>6138. Abu Hazim related from Sahl that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "I have been sent and I and the FinalHour are like this," and he indicated his two fingers which he extended.<P>6139.

The rising of the sun from the west</B><P>6141. 'Abdu'r-Rahman related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said "The Final Hour will not comeuntil the sun rises from the west. When people see it, whoever is one theearth will believe. That is the time when, <I>'No faith which a self professeswill be of any use to it if it did not believe before and earn good in itsfaith.' </I>(6:158) The Final Hour will come while two men are spreadinga garment between them and will not finish their transaction or fold it up.The Final Hour will come while a man is carrying the milk of his milk-camel,but will not be able to taste it. The Final Hour will come while someoneis mending his water basin and will not be able to water from it. The FinalHour will come when someone is raising his food to his mouth but will notbe able to taste it."<P><P><B>XLI. "Allah wants to meet anyone who wants to meet Him. Allah is averseto meeting anyone who is averse to meeting Him."</B><P>6142. Anas related from 'Ubada ibn as-Samit that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Allah wants to meet anyone who wants to meetHim. Allah is averse to meeting anyone who is averse to meeting Him."<P>'A'isha or one of his wives said, "We dislike death." He said, "It does notmean that, but the when the believer is given the good news of the mercyof Allah and His pleasure and His garden, he wants to meet Allah. and soAllah wants to meet him. When the unbeliever is given the news of the punishmentof Allah and His wrath, he is averse to meeting Allah and so Allah is averseto meeting him."<P>Abu Dawud and 'Amr summarised it from Shu'ba.<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Sa'd from 'A'isha from the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace.<P>6143. Abu Burda related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Allah wants to meet anyone who wants to meetHim. Allah is averse to meeting anyone who is averse to meeting Him.<P>6144. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab and 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr among the men of knowledgethat 'A'isha said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was in good health, he used to say, 'No Prophet dies until he sees his seatin the Garden, and then is made to live or is given a choice.' When he wasill and near death and his head was on my thigh, he fainted for a time andwhen he recovered, his eyes were fixed on the ceiling and then he said, "OAllah, with the Highest Companion.' I said, 'Then he is not going to choseus!' and I recognised that it was what he had said to us." She said, "Thelast words which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidwas, 'O Allah, with the Highest Companion.'"<P><P><B>XLII. Death throes</B><P>6145. Abu 'Amr Dhakwan, the client of 'A'isha, related that 'A'isha usedto say, "There was a vessel or a container ('Amr was unsure) containing somewater in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace. He began to put his hands in the water and wipe his face with them,saying, 'There is no god but Allah. Death has agonies.' Then he raised hishand and began to say, 'O Prophet, with the Highest Companion,' until hedied and his hand dropped."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that the container (<I>'ulba</I>) is made of wood andthe vessel (<I>rakwa</I>) is made of skin.<P>6146. It is related from 'Urwa that 'A'isha said, "Some coarse men of theBedouins came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andasked him , 'When will the Final Hour come?' He was looking at the youngestof them and said, 'If this one should live, then your Hour will come to youbefore he is senile.'" Hisham said that he meant their death.<P>6147. Ma'di ibn Ka'b ibn Malik related that Qatada ibn Rib'i al-Ansari saidthat a funeral passed by the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and said, 'Relieved and relieving.' They asked, 'Messengerof Allah, what is relieved and relieving?' He said, 'The believing slaveis relieved of the tools of this world and its harm to the mercy if Allahand the people and lands, trees and animals are relieved of the impious slave."<P>6148. Ibn Ka'b related from Abu Qatada that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Relieved and relieving. The believer isrelieved..."<P>6149. 'Amr ibn Hazm said that he heard Anas ibn Malik say that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Three things followa dead person: his family, his property and his actions. Two of them returnand one remains with him. His family and property return and his actionsremain."<P>6150. Nafi' related that Ibn 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When one of you dies, he is shownhis seat morning and evening, either in the Fire or in the Garden. It willbe said, 'This is your seat until you are resurrected to it.'"<P>6151. Mujahid related that 'A'isha said that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Do not abuse the dead, They have gone towhat they sent ahead."<P><P><B>XLIII. The Blowing of the Trumpet</B><P>Mujahid said, "The Trumpet (<I>sur</I>) is like a horn." "<I>Zajra</I>" (37:19)means "shout".<P>Ibn 'Abbas said tha<I>t "naqur"</I> (74:7) means trumpet. <I>Ar-Rajifa</I>(79:6) is the first blast and <I>ar-Radifa </I>(74:8) is the second blast.<P>6152. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman and 'Abdu'r-Rahman al-A'raj related thatAbu Hurayra said, "Two men insulted one another - one of the men was a Muslimand the other man was a Jew. The Muslim said, 'By the One who chose Muhammadover all the worlds,' and the Jew said, 'By the One who chose Musa over allthe worlds.' At that, the Muslim became angry and slapped the Jew's face.So the Jew went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and told him about what had happened between him and the Muslim.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stated,'Do not prefer me over Musa. On the Day of Rising, people will faint, andI will be the first to regain consciousness, and there will be Musa graspingthe Throne. I do not know whether he will be among those who fainted andcame to before me, or if he was one of those that Allah excepted.'"<P>6153. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "People will faint when they faint, and Iwill be the first to get up and Musa will be there grasping the Throne. Ido not know whether he will be among those who faint."<P>Abu Sa'id related it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace.<P><P><B>XLIV. Allah will hold the earth on the Day of Rising</B><P>Nafi' related it from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace.<P>6154. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah will hold the earth androll up the heaven in his right hand. Then He will say, 'I am the King. Whereare the kings of the earth?'"<P>6155. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'On the Day of Rising theearth will be like a loaf of bread and the Compeller will turn it over asone of you turns over his bread in a journey to be given as hospitality forthe people of the Garden.'* A Jewish man came and said, 'May the All-Mercifulbless you, Abu'l-Qasim, shall I inform you about the hospitality of the peopleof the Garden on the Day of Rising?' He said, 'Yes, indeed.' He said, 'Theearth will be like a loaf of bread as the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,looked at us and then laughed until his molars could be seen. Then he said,'Shall I tell you about their condiment?' He said, 'Their condiment willbe <I>balam</I> and <I>nun</I>.' They asked, 'What is that?' He answered,'Ox and fish. Seventy thousand people will eat from the extra lobe of theirlivers."<P>[*Editor's note: It will be like a large loaf of bread from which the believerswill eat from under their feet until the Reckoning is finished. "<I>Balam</I>is a Hebrew word meaning "ox".]<P>6156. Abu Hazim related that he heard Sahl ibn Sa'd say that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "People will be gathered onthe Day of Rising on reddish-white land like a loaf of fine bread." Sahlor someone else said, "There will be no landmarks for anyone on it."<P><P><B>XLV. How the Gathering will be</B><P>6157. Abu Hurayra related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "Mankind will be gathered in three manners: those with desire[to meet Allah], those with fear, and they will be two to a camel, threeto a camel, four to camel and ten to a camel. The Fire will gather the restand it will stop with them for their midday nap when they stop for it andspend the night with them where they spend the night and will be with themin the morning and with them in the evening."<P>6158. Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik that a man said, "Prophet of Allah,how will an unbeliever be gathered on his face?" he answered, "Is not theOne who made him walk on two legs in this world able to make him walk onhis face on the Day of Rising?" Qatada said, "Yes, by the power of our Lord!"<P>6159. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that he heard Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'You will meet Allahbarefoot, naked, walking and uncircumcised.'"<P>6160. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that he heard Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying whilespeaking on the minbar, "You will meet Allah barefoot, naked and uncircumcised."<P>6161. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, stood among us and gave a speech in whichhe said, 'You will be gathered barefoot, naked and uncircumcised. <I>"AsWe originated the first creation, so We will regenerate it." </I>(21:104)The first of creatures to be clothed on the Day of Rising will be Ibrahim.Then some men of my community will be brought and taken to the left. I willsay, "O My Lord! My Companions!" He will say, "You do not know what theyinnovated after you." I will say the same as the righteous slave ('Isa)said<I>, "And I was a witness over then while I was among them</I> ...to.<I>. the All-Wise." </I>(5:117-118) He said, 'It will be said, 'They neverstopped turning back on their heels."'"<P>6162. Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr related that 'A'isha said that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "You willbe gathered barefoot, naked and uncircumcised." 'A'isha said, "I said, 'Messengerof Allah, men and women looking at one another?' He answered, "The businesswill be too severe for them to be concerned by that.'"<P>6163. 'Amr ibn Maymun related that 'Abdullah [ibn Mas'ud] said, "We werewith the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ina tent and he said, 'Would you be content to be a quarter of the people ofthe Garden?' We said, 'Yes.' He asked, 'Would you be content to be a thirdof the people of the Garden?' We said, 'Yes.' He asked, 'Would you be contentto be a half of the people of the Garden?' We said, 'Yes.' He said, 'By theOne who has the soul of Muhammad in His hand, I hope that you will be halfof the people of the Garden. That is because only a submitting soul entersthe Garden, and, compared the people of idolatry, you are only like a whitehair on the hide of a black ox, or like a black hair on the hide of a redox.'"<P>6164. Abu'l-Ghayth related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "The first to be called on the Day of Risingwill be Adam and he will be shown his offspring and it will be said, 'Thisis your father, Adam.' He will say, 'At your service.' He will say, 'Bringout those of your offspring who merit Hell.' He will ask, 'How many shouldI take out?' He will say, 'Take ninety-nine out of every hundred.' They said,'Messenger of Allah, if ninety-nine out of every hundred are taken away,what will remain of us?' He said, 'My community among the communities arelike a white hair in the black ox.'"<P><P><B>XLVI. His words, <I>"The quaking of the Hour is a terrible thing."</I>(22:1)</B><P><I>"Azifat al-Azifa":</I> "The Imminent is imminent!" (53:57). <I>"The Houris near" </I>(54:1)<P>6165. Abu Salih related from Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty will say, 'O Adam!'He will say, 'At Your service and obedience, and good is in Your hand.' Hewill say, 'Bring out the people who merit the Fire.' He will say, 'How manyare those who merit the Fire?' He will say, 'Nine hundred and ninety-nineout of every thousand.' At that time the child will become white-haired and<I>'every pregnant woman will abort the contents of her womb, and you will thinkpeople drunk when they are not drunk; it is just that the punishment of Allahis so severe.' </I>(22:2) That was hard for them and they said, 'O Messengerof Allah! Who of us is that one!' He said, 'Rejoice, there is one thousandfrom Ya'juj and Ma'juj and one man from among you.' Then he said, 'By theOne who has my soul in His hand, I hope that you will be a third of the peopleof the Garden.' We praised Allah and said, 'Allah is greater!' He said, 'Bythe One who has my soul in His hand, I hope that you will be half of thepeople of the Garden.' Among people you are only like a white hair on thehide of a black ox or like a branding mark on the foreleg of a donkey.'"<P><P><B>XLVII. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Do such people not realise thatthey will be raised up on a Terrible Day, the Day mankind will stand beforethe Lord of all the worlds?" </I>(83:4-6)</B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said, <I>"They disown those who followed them." (</I>2:166) Theseare ties of connections in this world.<P>6166. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, "A Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of theWorlds," and said, "Each of them will stand in his sweat up to the middleof his ears."<P>6167. Abu'l-Ghayth related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of Rising peoplewill sweat until their sweat disappears into the earth for seventy cubitsand it will reach their ears."<P><P><B>XLVIII. Retaliation on the Day of Rising</B><P>The Day of Rising is <I>al-Haqqa</I> (the Indubitable) because in it therewill be rewards and confirmed true matters [like reward and punishment].<I>Al-Haqqa </I>and<I> al-H&acirc;qqa </I>mean the same. It is called<I>al-Qari'a </I>(the Crashing Blow), <I>al-Ghashiyya</I> (the Overwhelmer),<I>as-Sakhkha </I>(the Deafener) and <I>at-Taghabun </I>(Profit and Loss):referring to the loss (<I>ghabn</I>) the People of the Garden cause the peopleof the Fire [by taking their portion and positions in the Garden].<P>6168. It is related that Shaqiq heard from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The first of what will judgedbetween people is bloodshed [those wrongly killed]."<P>6169. Sa'id al-Maqburi related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever has done an injusticeto his brother should seek to be absolved by him before there will be neitherdinar nor dirham, before some of his right actions will be taken from himfor his brother, and if he does not have any good actions, some of the badactions of his brother will be taken and cast on him."<P>6170. Yazid ibn Zuray' recited, <I>"We will strip away any rancour in theirhearts ..." </I>(15:47)<P>Abu'l-Mutawakkil an-Naji related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the believersare saved from the Fire, they will be made to stop at a bridge between theGarden and the Fire where they will inflict retaliation from one anotherfor the injustices which arose between them on this world until they arepurified and purged. They will be given permission to enter the Garden. Bythe One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, one of you will recognisehis dwelling in the Garden better than he recognises his dwelling in thisworld."<P><P><B>XLIX. Whoever has his reckoning scrutinised will be punished</B><P>6171. Ibn Abi Mulayka related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Whoever has his reckoning scrutinised willbe punished." She said, "I said, 'Does not Allah say, <I>"He will be givenan easy reckoning" </I>(84:8)?' He said, 'That is the simple presentation.'"<P>Ibn Abi Mulayka said, "I heard 'A'isha say, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace...'"<P>Ibn Jurayj, Muhammad ibn Sulaym, Ayyub, and Salih ibn Rustum corroboratedit from Ibn Abi Mulayka from 'A'isha from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace.<P>6172. Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad related from 'A'isha that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever has his reckoningtaken on the Day of Rising will be destroyed." [She said,] "I said, 'Messengerof Allah, does not Allah say, <I>"Then as for him who will be given his recordin his right hand, he will be given an easy reckoning"</I> (84:8)?' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'That is the simplepresentation. Anyone who has his reckoning scrutinised on the Day of Risingwill be punished.'"<P>6173. It is related from Qatada from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace...<P>It is related from Qatada from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, "The unbeliever willbe brought on the Day and Rising and it will be said to him, 'If you wereto have enough gold to fill the earth, would you ransom yourself with it?'He will say, 'Yes.' He will be told, 'You were asked for what is easier thanthat.'"<P>6174. Khaythama related from 'Adi ibn Hatim said the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "There is none of you but that Allah willspeak to him on the Day of Rising with no interpreter between Allah and him.Then he will look and see nothing before him, Then he will look in frontof him and the Fire will be facing him, Whoever of you is able should protecthimself from the Fire, even if only with half a date."<P>Khaythama related from 'Adi ibn Hatim that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Protect yourselves from the Fire." Then he turnedand averted his face and then said, "Protect yourselves from the Fire." Thenhe turned and averted his face a third time until we thought that he waslooking at it and then said, "Protect yourselves from the Fire, even if onlywith half a date, or, if he cannot manage even that, then with a good word."<P><P><B>L. Seventy thousand will enter the Garden without reckoning</B><P>6175. Husayn said, "I was with Sa'id in Jubayr and he said that Ibn 'Abbasreported to him that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "All the nations were shown to me and I saw a Prophet pass by witha nation and a Prophet pass by with a group and a Prophet pass by with tenpeople and a Prophet pass by with five people, and a Prophet pass by alone.Then I looked and there was an enormous mass. I asked, "Jibril, is this mycommunity?" He answered, "No, but look at the horizon.' I looked and therewas a dark mass. He said, 'This is your community. Seventy thousand of themwill enter the Garden without reckoning or punishment.' I asked, 'Why?' Hesaid, 'They did not have themselves cauterised nor did they use incantationnor seek omens and put their trust in their Lord.' 'Ukkasha ibn Mihsan stoodup and said, 'Ask Allah to make me one of them.' He said, 'O Allah, makehim one of them!' Then another man stood up and said, 'Ask Allah to makeme one of them.' He said, ''Ukkasha has beaten you to it.'"<P>6176. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "A crowd of seventythousand of my community will enter the Garden and their faces will shinelike the moon shines on the night of the full moon.'" Abu Hurayra said, "'Ukkashaibn Mihsan al-Asadi stood up, lifting his mantle and said, 'Messenger ofAllah, ask Allah to make me one of them.' He said, 'O Allah, make him oneof them!' Then a man of the Ansar stood and said, 'Messenger of Allah, askAllah to make me one of them.' He said, ''Ukkasha has beaten you to it.'"<P>6177. Abu Hazim related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Seventy thousand or seven hundred thousand(he was unsure about which) of my community will enter the Garden holdingon to one another and clinging to one another until the first and last ofthem enter the Garden with their faces shining like the moon on the nightof the full moon."<P>6178. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "The people of the Garden will enter the Gardenand the people of the Fire will enter the Fire and then an announcer willstand between them and call, 'People of the Fire! No death! People of theGarden, no death! Eternity!"<P>6179. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "It will be said to the people of the Garden,'People of the Garden! Eternity with no death!' and to the people of theFire, 'People of the Fire! Eternity with no death!'"<P><P><B>LI. Description of the Garden and the Fire</B><P>Abu Sa'id said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "The first food which the people of the Garden eat will be the extralobe of the liver of the fish."<P>'Adn (9:72) is eternity. The verb <I>'adana</I> in respect of the earth meansto reside on it. Derived from it is <I>ma'dan</I> (mineral), <I>"Fi maq'adisidq" </I>(on seats of honour) (54:55) is in a place of truthfulness.<P>6180. Abu Raja' related from 'Imran that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "I looked at the Garden and saw that most of itspeople were poor. I looked at the Fire and saw that most of its people werewomen."<P>6181. Abu 'Uthman related from Usama that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "I stood at the gate of the Garden and most ofthose who entered it were poor while the wealthy were held back, but thepeople of the Fire had been commanded to enter the Fire. I stood at the gateof the Fire and most of those who entered it were women."<P>6182. Ibn 'Umar related that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "When the people of the Garden go to the Gardenand the people of the Fire to the Fire, death* will be brought and placedbetween the Garden and the Fire and then slaughtered. Then a caller willcall out, 'People of the Fire! No death! People of the Garden, no death!'The people of the Garden will have joy added to their joy and the peopleof the Fire will have sorrow added to their sorrow.'"<P>[*In the form of a ram.]<P>6183. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah - blessedis He and exalted - will say to the people of the Garden, 'People of theGarden!' and they will say, 'At Your service and obedience, our Lord.' Hewill ask, 'Are you pleased?' They will answer, 'How can we not be pleasedwhen You have given us what You have not given to any of Your creation?'He will say, 'I will give you better than that?' They will say, 'Our Lord,what could be better than that?' He will say, 'I will bestow My pleasureon you and I will never be angry with you after that ever again.'"<P>6184. Humayd said, "I heard Anas say, 'Haritha was killed in the Battle ofBadr while he was still a lad. His mother went to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, you know theplace Haritha has with me. If he is in the Garden, I will be patient andexpect a reward. If it is otherwise, then you will see what I will do.' Hesaid, 'Mercy to you! Are you raving? Is there only one Garden? There aremany Gardens, and he is in the Garden of Firdaws."<P>6185. Abu Hazim related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "The distance between the shoulders of anunbeliever will be the distance a fast rider travels in three days."<P>6186. Abu Hazim related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is a tree in the Gardenwhose shade a rider will not be able to ride across in a hundred years."<P>Abu Hazim related from an-Nu'man ibn Abi 'Ayyash from Abu Sa'id that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "In the Garden thereis a tree whose shade the rider of a fast, well fed horse will not be ableto ride across in a hundred years.""<P>6187. Abu Hazim related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Seventy thousand or seven hundredthousand (he was unsure about which) of my community will enter the Gardenholding on to one another and clinging to one another and the first willnot enter until the last of them enter with their faces like the moon onthe night of the full moon."<P>6188. Sahl related that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "The people of the Garden will see the upper rooms in the Garden asyou see the stars in the sky."<P>An-Nu'man ibn Abi 'Ayyash said, "I was present and heart Abu Sa'id relateit and he added, "As you see the setting star on the east and west horizon.'"<P>6189. Abu 'Imran related that he heard Anas ibn Malik reported that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty will say tothe person who has the least punishment in the Fire on the Day of Rising,'If you were to have everything in the earth, would you ransom yourself withit?' He will say, 'Yes.' He will say, "I demanded less than this from youwhen you were in the loins of Adam: not to associate anything with Me, butyou refused to do anything but associate things with Me."<P>6190. 'Amr related from Jabir that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "Some will be brought out of the Fire by intercession lookinglike <I>tha'arir</I>." I said, 'What are <I>tha'arir</I>?"* He answered,"<I>Daghabis</I>." At that time he was toothless and I said to 'Amr ibn Dinar,"Abu Muhammad, I heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, 'I heard the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Some will be brought out of theFire by intercession."' He said, 'Yes.'"<P>[*He said tha'arir and meant sha'arir." Small cucumbers whic grow at thebase of frees and have no leaves and are somewhat bitter.]<P>6191. Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Some people will emerge from the Fire afterhaving been touched by the heat of the Fire and they will enter the Gardenand the people of the Garden will call them the Jahannamites (the Hellfireones)."<P>6192. Yahya related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "When the people of the Garden haveentered the Garden and the people of the Fire have entered the Fire, Allahwill say, 'Take out of (the Fire) whoever has the weight of a mustard-seedof faith in his heart. They will come and they will have been burned andbecome like coal. They will be thrown into the River of Life and they willgrow as a seed grows on the scum of the torrent, or the mud of the torrent."The Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do you notsee that it comes out yellow and twisted?"<P>6193. Abu Ishaq related that an-Nu'man said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, say, 'The person with the least punishmentthe Fire on the Day of Rising will be man under the arch of whose feet willbe an ember on account of which his brains will boil."<P>6194.

Khaythama related from 'Adi ibn Hatim that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, mentioned the Fire and turned his face aside andsought refuge from it. Then he mentioned the Fire and turned his face asideand sought refuge from it. Then he said, "Protect yourselves against theFire, even with half a date. If someone cannot find that, then with a goodword."<P>6196. 'Abdullah ibn Khabbab related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that he heardthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say whenhis uncle, Abu Talib, was mentioned in his presence, "Perhaps my intercessionwill be of benefit to him on the Day of Rising and he will be put in a swallowplace in the Fire which only reaches his ankles from which the top of hisbrain will boil."<P>6197. Qatada related from Anas &#163; that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of Rising people will begathered and they will say, 'If only we could ask someone to intercede forus with our Lord!' They will go to Adam and say, 'You are one whom Allahcreated with His hand and breathed of His ruh into you, and He commandedHis angels to prostrate to you. Intercede on our behalf with your Lord.'He will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mention his errorand say, 'Go to Nuh. He is the first Messenger that Allah sent.' They willgo to him and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mentionhis error and say, 'Go to Ibrahim whom Allah took as a friend.' They willgo to him and he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mentionhis error. 'Go to Musa to whom Allah spoke directly .' They will go to himand he will say, 'I am not worthy of this task,' and he will mention hiserror and will say, 'Go to 'Isa.' But he will say, 'I am not worthy of thistask, Go to Muhammad, whose past and future wrong actions Allah has forgiven.'They will come to me and I will go to ask permission from my Lord. When Isee my Lord, I will fall down in prostration and He will leave me as longas Allah wills. Then I will be told, 'Raise your head and ask and you willbe given. Speak and it will be heard. Intercede and intercession will begranted.' I will lift my head and praise Him with praises which He will teachme. I will intercede and He will fix an amount for me and I will bring themout of the Fire and let them into the Garden. Then I will return and falldown in prostration like that for a third and fourth time until only thoseremain in the Fire whom the Qur'an has held.'" Qatada used to say at that,'...and for whom eternity is obliged.'"<P>6198. Abu Raja' related from 'Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Some people will emerge from the Fireby the intercession of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and will enter the Garden and will be called the Jahannamites."<P>6199. Humayd related from Anas that Umm Haritha came to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after Haritha was killedin the Battle of Badr by an arrow from an unknown person. She said, 'Messengerof Allah, you know the position of Haritha in my heart. If he is in the Garden,I will not weep for him. Otherwise, you will see what I will do?' He saidto her, 'Are you raving? Is there only one Garden? There are many gardens,He is in the highest Firdaws.'"<P>He said, "Setting out in the Way of Allah in the morning or evening is betterthan this world and what it contains. The place of the bow of one of youor the place of a foot in the Garden is better than this world and what itcontains. If one of the women of the people of the Garden were to look atthe earth, she would illuminate what is between it and fill what is betweenthem with perfume and her veil is better than this world and what it contains."<P>6200. Al-A'raj related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "No one will enter the Garden but that hewill be shown what would have been his place in the Fire if he had done evilin order increase his thankfulness, and no one will enter the Fire but thathe will see his place in the Garden if he had done good so that it is grieffor him."<P>6201. Sa'id ibn Abi Sa'id al-Maqburi related that Abu Hurayra said, "I said,'Messenger of Allah, who will be the most fortunate of people by yourintercession on the Day of Rising?' He said, 'Abu Hurayra, I thought thatno one would ask me about this hadith before you since I see your eagernessfor hadith. The most fortunate of people with My intercession on the Dayof Rising will be the one who says, 'There is no god but Allah' sincerelyfrom inside himself."<P>6202. 'Abida related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "I know who will be the last of the people ofthe Fire to emerge from him and the last of the people of the Garden to enterit. A man will emerge crawling from the Fire and Allah will say, 'Go andenter the Garden.' He will go to it and imagine that it is full and willreturn and say, 'Lord, I found it full.' He will say, 'Go and enter the Gardenand you will have the like of this world and ten times more,' or 'You willhave ten times the like of this world.' He will say, 'Are you mocking me?'or 'Are you laughing at me when you are the King?'" He said, "I saw the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughing until his molarsshowed. It is said that that will be the person with the lowest degree ofthe people of the Garden."<P>6203. 'Abdullah ibn al-Harith ibn Nawfal related that al-'Abbas asked theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Did you benefit Abu Talibin any way?"<P><P><B>LII. The Sirat is a bridge across Jahannam</B><P>6204. Sa'id and 'Ata' ibn Yazid related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>'Ata' ibn Yazid al-Laythi related that Abu Hurayra said, "Some people said,'Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Rising?' He said,'Do you have any doubt about seeing the moon on a night when it is full andthere are no clouds obscuring it?' They said, 'No, Messenger of Allah.' Hesaid, 'Do you have any doubt about seeing the sun when there are no cloudsobscuring it?' They said, 'No, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'That is howyou will see Him on the Day of Rising. Allah will gather people togetherand will say, "Whoever used worship something should follow it." Those whoworshipped the sun will follow it, those who worshipped the moon will followit, and those who worshipped idols will follow them. This community willbe left, together with its hypocrites. Then Allah will come to them in otherthan the form which they recognise and say, "I am your Lord." They will say,"We seek refuge with Allah from you. This where we stay until our Lord comesto us. When our Lord comes to us, we will recognise him." Then Allah willcome to them again in the form which they recognise and say, "I am your Lord."They will say, "You are our Lord," and they will follow him. A bridge willbe set up over Jahannam.'<P>"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Iwill be the first to cross it. The supplication of the Messengers on thatday will be, "O Allah, preserve us! Preserve us!" It has hooks like the thornsof the prickly-plant Have you seen the thorns of the prickly-plant?' Theysaid, 'Yes, indeed, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'They are like the thornsof the prickly-plant except that only Allah knows how huge they are. Theywill hook onto people according to their actions. Some of them will be destroyedby their actions and some will be lacerated and then saved. When Allah hasfinished judging between His slaves and wishes to bring out of the Fire thoseHe wishes to bring out of the Fire of those who used to testify, "There isno god but Allah," He will command the angels to bring them out. They willrecognise them by the mark of <I>sajda</I>. Allah has forbidden the Fireto consume the mark of <I>sajda</I> on the child of Adam. They will emergefrom the Fire burned and blackened and a water called the water of life willbe poured over them and they will grow as the seed on the bank of a streamgrows. Then only one man will be left who will be facing the Fire and hewill say, "O Lord! Its wind has poisoned me and its blaze has burned me!Turn my face away from the Fire!" He will continue to supplicate Allah whowill say, "If I grant you that, perhaps you will ask something else?" Hewill say, "No, by Your might! I will not ask Me for anything else!" Allahwill turn his face away from the Fire.<P>"'Then he will say after that, "O Lord, bring me near to the door of theGarden!" Allah will say, "Did you not claim that you would not ask Me foranything else? Woe to you, son of Adam! How treacherous you are!" He willcontinue to supplicate Him and Allah will say, "If I grant you that, youwill ask something else." He will say, "No, by Your might, I will not askfor anything except that!" He will give pledges and promises that he willnot ask Him for anything else, and He will bring him right up to the doorof the Garden. When he sees what it contains, he will be silent for as longas Allah wishes him to be silent. Then he will say, "O Lord, let me enterthe Garden!" Allah will say, "Did you not claim that you would not ask Mefor anything else? Woe to you, child of Adam! How treacherous you are!" Hewill say, "O Lord, do not make me the most wretched of Your creation!" Hewill continue to supplicate Him until He will laugh at him. When He laughsat him, He will then give him permission to enter it. When he enters it,he will be told, "Wish from that" and he will make wishes until, when hestops wishing, He will say to him, "You can have that and the same again."'"<P>Abu Hurayra said, "That man will be the last of the people of the Gardento enter it."<P>He ('Ata') said, "Abu Sa'id al-Khudri was sitting with Abu Hurayra and didnot change any of his <I>hadith</I> until he reached his words, 'You canhave that and the same again.' and Abu Sa'id said, 'I heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "You can have thatand the same ten times over.'" Abu Hurayra said, 'I remember it as "the sameagain.'"<P><P><B>LIII. The Basin (al-Hawd)</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Truly We have given you the Great Abundance(Kawthar)."</I> (108:1)<P>'Abdullah ibn Zayd said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "Be steadfast until you meet me at the Basin."<P>6205. Shaqiq related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "I will be your predecessor at the Basin."<P>Al-Mughira said, "I heard Abu Wa'il related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I will be your predecessorat the Basin. Some men from among you will be shown to me and them draggedaway from me. I will say, 'O Lord, my Companions!' It will be said, 'Youdo not know what they innovated after you.'"<P>'Asim corroborated it from Abu Wa'il.<P>Another isnad from Abu Wa'il from Hudhayfa from the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace.<P>6206. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Still before you is the Basin whose size is asgreat as what is between Jarba' and Adhrah."<P>6207. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Kawthar is the greatgood which Allah gave him."<P>Abu Bishr said, "I said to Sa'id, "Some people claim that it is a river inthe Garden." Sa'id answered, "The river which is in the Garden is part ofthe good which Allah has given him."<P>6208. Ibn Abi Mulayka related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "My Basin covers the distanceof a month. Its water is whiter than milk and its scent more fragrant thanmusk. Its jugs are like the stars of the sky. Whoever drinks from it willnever be thirsty again.<P>6209. Ibn Shihab related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The length of my Basin islike the distance between Ayla and San'a in Yemen. It has jugs like the numberof the stars of the sky."<P>6210. Qatada related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "While I was travelling in the Garden, I cameto a river on the banks of which were tents made of hollow pearls. I asked,'What is this, Jibril?' He said, 'This is the Kawthar which your Lord hasgiven you. Its mud - or its scent - is that of pungent musk." (Hudba wasunsure about which word was used.)<P>6211. 'Abdu'l-'Aziz related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Some of my companions will come to me at theBasin and when I recognise, they will be dragged away from me. I will say,'My companions!' It will be said, 'You do not know what they innovated afteryou.'"<P>6212. Abu Hazim related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "I will be your predecessor at the Basin.Whoever passes by me will drink from it and whoever drinks from it will neverbe thirsty again. Some people will come to me some I recognise and they willrecognise me and then there will be barrier between me and them."<P>Abu Hazim said, "When an-Nu'man ibn Abi 'Ayyas heard me, he asked, 'Did youhear this from Sahl?' 'Yes,' I answered. He said, 'I testify that I heardit from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and he added, 'I will say, "They are from me!"It will be said, "You do not know what they innovated after you." I willsay, 'Far, far away are those who altered after me!"'"<P>Ibn 'Abbas said that "<I>suhqan</I>"(67:11) means "far". It is said that"<I>sahiq</I>" (22:31) means "distant". <I>Sahaqa</I> and <I>ashaqa</I> mean"to put far away".<P>6213. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related that Abu Hurayra related that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A group of mycompanions will come to me on the Day of Rising and they will be turned awayfrom my Basin. I will say, 'O Lord, my companions!' He will say, 'You donot know what they innovated after you. They turned their backs and revertedto apostates."<P>6214. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related from the Companions of the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Some men of my companions will come to the Basinand then will be prevented from reaching it. I will say, O Lord, my companions!'He will say, 'You do not know what they innovated after you. They turnedtheir backs and reverted to apostates.'"<P>Shu'ayb said from az-Zuhri, "Abu Hurayra used to related from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "<I>yujlawna</I> (diverted from)"and 'Uqayl said, <I>"yuhalla'una</I> (prevented from)".<P>Another <I>isnad</I> from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace.<P>6215. 'Ata' ibn Yasar related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "While I was asleep, a group came untilI recognised them, and then a man came between me and them. He said, 'Comealong.' I said, 'Where?' He said, 'To the Fire, by Allah,' I asked, 'Whatis their business?' He said, 'They turned their backs and reverted to apostates.'Then there was another group and when I recognised them, a man came betweenme and them and he said, 'Come along.' I said, 'Where?' He said, 'To theFire, by Allah,' I asked, 'What is their business?' He said, 'They turnedtheir backs and reverted to apostates.' I did not see any of them escapingexcept a few who were like neglected livestock."<P>6216. Hafs ibn 'Asim related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Between my house and my minbaris one of the meadows of the Garden. My minbar is over the Basin."<P>6217. 'Abdu'l-Malik related that he heard Jundub say, "I heard the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'I will be your predecessorat the Basin.'"<P>6218. Abu'l-Khayr related from 'Uqba that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, went out one day and prayed the prayer for the deadover the people of Uhud. Then he went to the minbar and said, "I will beyour predecessor at the Basin, and I am a witness for you. By Allah, I amlooking at My Basin now. I have been given the keys of the treasures of theearth (or the keys of the earth). By Allah, I do not fear for you that youwill associate others with Allah after me, but I fear that you contend withone another for it."<P>6219. Ma'bad ibn Khalid related that he heard Haritha ibn Wahb say, "I heardthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mention the Basin andhe said, "It is similar to the distance between Madina and San'a'."<P>Ma'bad ibn Khalid related that Haritha heard the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, say that the width of his Basin's width is similarto the distance between&nbsp;Madina and San'a'."<P>Al-Mustawrid said to him, "Did you not heard him say 'vessels'?" He said,"Yes." Al-Mustawrid said, "Vessels will be seen in it like the stars."<P>6220. Ibn Abi Mulayka related that Asma' bint Abi Bakr said that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I will be at the Basin lookingat those of you who come to me. Some people will be taken from me and I willsay, 'O Lord, they are from me and part of my community!' It will be said,'Are you aware of what they did after you? By Allah, they kept on turningback on their heels.'" <P>Ibn Abi Mulayka used to say, "O Allah, we seek refuge with You from turningback on our heels or being tested in our <I>deen</I>.'"<P><I>"You used to turn round on your heels" </I>(23:66) means "to turn backon the heels."<P>  <HR><P ALIGN=Center><B><BIG><A HREF="bukhcont.html">Return to Contents</A></BIG></B><P ALIGN=Center><BIG><B><A HREF="index.html">Return to Home Page</A></B></BIG><P></BODY></HTML>
