Book of Divorce</BIG></B><P><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"O Prophet! When any of you divorce women,divorce them during their period of purity and calculate the waiting-periodcarefully." </I>(65:1)<P><I>Ahsaynahu </I>(36:12) means: "We recorded and counted."<P>The form of the &nbsp;<I>sunna</I> divorce is that a man divorces his wifein the presence of two witnesses when she is pure and they have not hadintercourse (since she became pure).<P>4953. It is related that in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar divorced his wife while she wasmenstruating. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, about that. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "Command him to take her back. Thenhe should keep her until she becomes pure and then menstruates and becomespure. Then, if he wants to do so, he can keep if, and if he wishes, he candivorce her while she is pure before having sex with her. That is the 'iddaas Allah has commanded for women who have been divorced."<P><P><B>I. When a menstruating woman is divorced, that is counted asa&nbsp;divorce</B><P>4954. Anas ibn Sirin said that he heard Ibn 'Umar say, "Ibn 'Umar divorcedhis wife while she was menstruating. 'Umar mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'Take her back.'"Anas asked, "Is it counted?" Ibn 'Umar said, "Yes, of course.<P>It is reported from Yunus ibn Jubayr that Ibn 'Umar that he said, "Commandhim to take her back." He asked, "Is it counted?" He said, "What would youthink if he were incapacitated and foolish?'"<P>It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr that Ibn 'Umar said, "It is counted asa divorce for me."<P><P><B>II. If someone divorces, and should a man tell his wife to her face thatshe is divorced?</B><P>4955. Al-Awza'i said, "I asked az-Zuhri, 'Which of the wives of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sought refuge from him?' He answered,''Urwa informed me from 'A'isha that when the daughter of al-Jawn* was broughtto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and hecame near her, she said, "I seek refuge with Allah from you." He said, "Youhave sought refuge with One Who is Immense. Rejoin your family."'"<P>It is reported from az-Zuhri that 'Urwa told him that 'A'isha said ...<P>[*It is said to be &nbsp;Umayma bint an-Nu'man ibn Sharahil or Asma' bintan-Nu'man ibn Abi'l-Jawn. "Rejoin your family" is an expression which meansdivorce.]<P>4956. It is related that Abu Usayd said, "We went out with the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, until we reached a walled garden calledash-Shawt and we went to two walls and sat down between them. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Sit here. and went in. TheJawniyya woman had been brought and lodged in a house in the date palms ofUmayma bint an-Nu'man ibn Sharahil. She had with her wet-nurse who was hergoverness. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, came to her, he said, 'Give yourself to me.' She replied, 'Can a queengive herself to a peasant?' He stretched his hand to her to calm her andshe said, 'I seek refuge with Allah from you!' He said, 'You have soughtrefuge with the Refuge.' Then he came out to us and said, 'Abu Usayd, giveher two long white linen garments and take her back to her family.'"<P>4957. It is related from Sahl and Abu Usayd, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, married Umayma bint Sharahil. When she was broughtto him, he stretched his hand to her and she seemed to dislike that. Thereforehe commanded Abu Usayma to prepare her and give her two white linen garments."<P>This is reported from Sahl ibn Sa'd.<P>4958. Abu Ghallab Yunus ibn Jubayr said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar, 'What if a mandivorces his wife while she is menstruating?' He said, 'Do you know Ibn 'Umar?Ibn 'Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating and 'Umar went tothe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned thatto him. He commanded him to take her back. When she became clean and he wantedto divorce her, he could divorce her.' I asked, 'Was that a divorce?' Hesaid, 'What would you think if he were incapacitated and foolish?'"<P><P><B>III. The one who allowed a treble divorce</B><P>By the words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Divorce can be pronounced twice; thenwives should be retained with correctness and courtesy or released with goodwill."</I> (2:229)<P>Ibn az-Zubayr said about a sick person* divorcing his wife, "I do not thinkthat his irrevocably divorced wife should inherit."<P>[*This is a person in an illness which will prove fatal.]<P>Ash-Sha'bi said, "She will inherit." Ibn Shubruma said [to ash-Sha'bi], "Canshe marry if the 'idda is finished?" "Yes," he answered. He said, "And whatdo you think if the second husband dies?" He retracted that view.<P>4959. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi reported that 'Umaymiral-'Ajlani came to 'Asim ibn 'Adi al-Ansari and said to him, "'Asim, whatdo you say about a man who finds another man with his wife? Should he killhim and then you kill him in turn? What else should he do? 'Asim, ask theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about that.''Asim asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,about that, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, disliked such questions and considered them to be blameworthy. What'Asim heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,say was hard on him. When 'Asim returned to his family, 'Umaymir came andsaid, ''Asim, what did the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, say to you?' 'Asim said, 'You have not brought me any good! TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, disliked thequestion which I asked him about.' 'Uwaymir said, 'By Allah, I will not stopuntil I ask the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,about that!'<P>"So 'Uwaymir went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, who was in the middle of the people and said, 'Messenger of Allah,if a man finds another man with his wife, should he kill him and then youkill him in turn? What else should he do?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah has sent down revelation aboutyou and your wife. Go and bring her.'"<P>Sahl said, "They cursed one another while I was with the people in the presenceof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When they finished,'Umaymir said, 'I would be lying about her if I were to keep her, Messengerof Allah.' So he divorced her three times before the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded him to do so."<P>Ibn Shihab said, "That was the <I>sunna</I> for those who curse one anotherin the <I>li'an</I>."<P>4960. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr reported that 'A'isha informed him that the wifeof Rifa'a al-Qurazi came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and said, "Messenger of Allah. Rifa'a has divorced me and it was afinal divorce. After him I married 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn az-Zubayr al-Quraziwho is flaccid (i.e. impotent).' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, &nbsp;said, 'Perhaps you want to return to Rifa'a?No, not until he experiences your sweetness and you experience his (i.e.the marriage is consummated).'"<P>4961. It is related from 'A'isha that a man divorced his wife three timesand she married and then was divorced and the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was asked if she was lawful to the first husband. Hesaid, "No, not until he experiences her sweetness as the first did."<P><P><B>IV. The one who gave his wives an option</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "O Prophet, tell your wives, 'If you desirethe life of this world and its finery, come and I will give you all you needand release you with kindliness.'" </I>(33:28)<P>4962. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, gave us a choice and we chose Allah and HisMessenger. That was not considered by us to be a divorce."<P>4963. It is related that Masruq said, "I asked 'A'isha about the choice andshe said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave usa choice. Was that a divorce?"<P>Masruq said, "I do not care whether I give her the choice once or a hundredtimes after she has chosen me."<P><P><B>V. If a man says, "I have parted from you," "I have let you go," or otherexpressions which indicate leaving or freeing, or that by which divorce wasmeant, it is according to what he intended</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"And let them go with kindliness" </I>(33:49)and <I>"And release you with kindliness." </I>(33:28)<P>He said, <I>"Then wives should be retained with correctness and courtesyor released with good will"</I> (2:229) and <I>"Or part from them withcorrectness and courtesy."</I> (65:2)<P>'A'isha said, "The Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, knewthat my parents would not tell me to separate from him."<P><P><B>VI. The man who says to his wife, "You are unlawful for me."</B><P>Al-Hasan [al-Basri] said, "It is according to his intention."<P>The people of knowledge say that when he divorces her three times, then sheis unlawful for him. So they called that unlawful (<I>haram</I>) by virtueof divorce and separation. This is not like someone who makes food unlawfulbecause lawful food cannot be called unlawful, while a divorced woman canbe called unlawful.<P>They said about a woman trebly divorced: She is not lawful for her husbanduntil she has married someone else.<P>Al-Layth reported that Nafi' said, "When Ibn 'Umar was asked about someonewho had pronounced three divorces, he said, 'Would that you had pronouncedone or two divorces. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,commanded me to do that. If you divorce her three times, then she is unlawfulfor you until she has married a husband other than you."<P>4964. It is related that 'A'isha said, "A man divorced his wife and she marriedanother husband and he divorced her. He was flaccid (i.e. impotent) and shecould not get anything she wanted from her and it was not long before hedivorced her. She went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and said, "Messenger of Allah, my husband divorced me and I marriedanother husband and he came in to me but he was only flaccid and only camenear me once but did not get anything from me. Am I lawful for my first husband?"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said. "Youare not lawful to your first husband until another experiences your sweetnessand you experience his.'"<P><P><B>VII. <I>"Why do you make forbidden what Allah has made lawful for you?"</I>(66:1)</B><P>4965. It is reported that Sa'id ibn Jubayr heard Ibn 'Abbas say, "If a mandeclares his wife unlawful for him, that means nothing." He added, "You indeedhave a good model in the Messenger of Allah."<P>4966. It is related that 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr said, "I heard 'A'isha say thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to stay with Zaynabbint Jahsh and drink honey with her. Hafsa and I decided that if he cameto either of us, she would say to him, 'I smell <I>maghafir</I> on you. Youhave eaten <I>maghafir</I> (a sweet gum with a foul smell).' He said, 'No,rather I have drunk honey with Zaynab bint Jahsh. I will do not so again.'"It was revealed <I>"O Prophet! Why do you make forbidden what Allah has madelawful for you, seeking the good pleasure of your wives</I>? ... to .. <I>"Ifthe two of you would turn to Allah." </I>(66:1-4) addressed to 'A'isha andHafsa. <I>"The Prophet confided a certain matter to one of his wives"</I>(66:3), which was his words, "I have drunk honey."<P>4967. It is related that 'A'isha $ said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, used to love honey and sweets. Afterfinishing<I> 'Asr</I>, he would go to his wives and stay with one of them.He went to Hafsa bint 'Umar and stayed longer than he used to. I was jealousand asked about that. I was told that a woman of her family had given hera skin filled with honey and she gave the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, a drink from it. I said, 'By Allah, we will play a trickon him. I said to Sawda bint Zam'a, 'He will come close to you. When he comesclose to you, say, "Have you eaten maghafir?" He will say, "No." Tell him,"Then what is this smell which I smell from you?" He will say, "Hafsa gaveme a drink of honey." Tell him, "Perhaps the bees visited 'Urfut trees*."I will say this as well. Safiyya, you say the same.' Sawda said, 'By Allah,as soon as he stood at the door, I wanted to say what you told me to sayout of fear of you.' So when he came near her, Sawda said to him, 'Messengerof Allah, have you eaten maghafir?' 'No,' he answered. She said, 'Then whatis this smell which I smell from you?' He answered, 'Hafsa gave me a drinkof honey.' She said, 'Perhaps the bees visited 'Urfut.' When he came to me,I said the same and when he went to Safiyya, she said the same. When he thenwent to Hafsa, she said, 'Messenger of Allah, shall I give you a drink ofit?' He said, 'I have no need of it.' Sawda said, 'By Allah, we have deprivedhim!' I told her, 'Be quiet.'"<P>[*This is the mimosa which produces a gum called mughfur or maghafir whichhas a foul smell.]<P><P><B>VIII. There is no divorce before marriage</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "O you who believe! When you marry believingwomen and then divorce them before you have touched them, there is nowaiting-period for you to calcuate for them, so give them a gift and letthem go with kindliness."</I> (33:49)<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "Allah made divorce only after marriage."<P>That is related from 'Ali, Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib, 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, AbuBakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman, 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba, Aban ibn 'Uthman,'Ali ibn Husayn, Shurayh, Sa'id ibn Jubayr, al-Qasim, Salim, Tawus, al-Hasan,'Ikrima, 'Ata', 'Amir ibn Sa'd, Jabir ibn Zayd, Nafi' ibn Jubayr, Muhammadibn Ka'b, Sulayman ibn Yasar, Mujahid, al-Qasim ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman, 'Amribn Harim, and ash-Sha'bi that she is not divorced [before marriage].<P><P><B>IX. When someone is forced to say about his wife, "She is my sister,"it is of no consequence</B><P>The Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Ibrahim saidabout Sara, 'This is my sister.' That meant his sister in respect of AllahAlmighty."<P><P><B>X. Divorce while compelled or forced and while drunk or insane, and itsstatus. Error and forgetfulness in divorce, <I>shirk</I> and other things</B><P>This is based on the statement of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, "Actions are by intention. Every man has what he obtained."<P>Ash-Sha'bi recited,<I> "Our Lord, do not take us to task if we forget ormake a mistake!" </I>(2:286)<P><B>What is not accepted of the admission of someone suffering fromwhisperings</B><P>The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to the personwho confessed against himself. "Are you mad?"<P>'Ali said, "Hamza slit the sides of my two she-camels and the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, began to rebuke Hamza. Hamza was drunkand his eyes became red. Then Hamza said, 'Are you not my father's slaves?'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw thathe was drunk, and so the Messenger of Allah* withdrew and we went out withhim.'"<P>'Uthman said, "There is no divorce by someone insane or intoxicated."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "A divorce by someone intoxicated or compelled is not adivorce.<P>'Uqba ibn 'Amir said, "A divorce by someone suffering whisperings is notallowed."<P>'Ata' said, "If someone begins with divorce (connected to a precondition),then it is according to the precondition."<P>Nafi' asked, "[What if] a man said that his wife was divorced irrevocablyif she goes out [of the house]?" Ibn 'Umar said, "If she goes out, then sheis irrevocably divorced from him. If she does not go out, there is nothing."<P>Az-Zuhri said about someone who says, "If I do such-and-such and such-and-such,my wife is trebly divorced," that he is questioned about what he said andwhat his heart intended when he made that oath. If he names a fixed timewhich he meant and that was in his heart when he made the oath, then thatis in his deen and his trustworthiness.<P>Ibrahim said, "If he says, 'I have no need of you,' it is according hisintention. Divorce is valid when pronounced in the language of any people."<P>Qatada said, "If he says, 'If you become pregnant, then you are trebly divorced,'he has sex with her once in every period of purity. If it becomes clear thatshe is pregnant, then she is irrevocably divorced."<P>Al-Hasan said, "If he says, 'Join your family,' then it is according to hisintention."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "Divorce should only occur when needed. Freeing slaves isthat which is meant for the sake of Allah."<P>Az-Zuhri said, "If he says, 'You are not my wife,' it is according to hisintention. If he intends divorce, it is as he said."<P>'Ali said. "Do you not know that the pen is lifted from three: a mad personuntil he recovers, a child until he comes of age, and someone asleep untilhe wakes up?"<P>'Ali said, "Every divorce is allowed except the divorce of the one who haslost his senses."<P>4968. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Allah has overlooked for my community that whichtheir selves say to them as long as that is not acted on or articulated."<P>Qatada said, "When someone pronounces a divorce in his mind, it is nothing."<P>4969. It is reported from Jabir that a man of the Banu Aslam came to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was in the mosqueand said that he had committed fornication. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, turned from him but the man moved to the side towhich he had turned and testified four times against himself. So he calledhim and asked, "Are you mad? Are you <I>muhsan</I>*?" The man said, "Yes,"and the Prophet commanded that he be stoned in the place of prayer. Whenthe edges of the stones hurt him, he fled, but was overtaken at al-Harraand killed.<P>[* Meaning that he had been previously married.]<P>4970. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man from the Banu Aslam cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was inthe mosque and called him, saying, 'Messenger of Allah, the other (meaninghimself) has committed fornication.' He turned from him but the man movedto the side to which he had turned and said, 'Messenger of Allah, the otherhas committed fornication.' He turned from him and the man again moved tothe side to which he had turned and said that to him. He turned from himand the man moved to him a fourth time. When he had testified against himselffour times, he called the man and asked, 'Are you mad?' 'No,' he answered.The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Go and stonehim.' He was <I>muhsan</I>."<P>Az-Zuhri reported that he heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari say, "I wasone of those who stoned him. We stoned him in the place of prayer at Madina.When the edges of the stones hurt him, he fled and we caught him at al-Harraand stoned him to death."<P><P><B>XI. The Khul' divorce and how one is divorced as means of it.</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "It is not lawful for you to keep anythingyou have given them unless a couple fear that they will not keep within Allah'slimits. If you fear that they will not keep within Allah's limits, thereis nothing wrong in a wife ransoming herself with some of it. These are Allah'slimits so do not overstep them. Those who overstep Allah's limits, they arethe wrongdoers."</I> (2:229)<P>'Umar allowed a khul' without the presence of an authority.<P>'Uthman allowed a khul' &nbsp;in return for everything except a hair binding.<P>Tawus said, <I>"If they fear that they will not keep within Allah's limits</I>"refers to what each of them owes the other in intimacy and companionship."He did not take the position of fools that it is not lawful unless she says,"I will not wash from you on account of <I>janaba</I>."<P>4971. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I notdo criticise Thabit ibn Qays for his character or his <I>deen</I>, but Idislike ingratitude in Islam." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Will you return his garden to him?" "Yes," sheanswered. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Accept your garden and divorce her once." Abu 'Abdullah [al-Bukhari]said, "It is uninterrupted from Ibn 'Abbas."<P>4972. It is related from 'Ikrima that the sister of 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy relatedthis. He said, "Will you return his garden to him?" "Yes," she said and shereturned it and he commanded that he divorce her."<P>It is reported from 'Ikrima that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "Divorce her."<P>It is related from 'Ikrima that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The wife of Thabit ibnQays came to the Prophey, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,"Messenger of Allah, I do not criticise Thabit ibn Qays in his deen or hischaracter, But I cannot endure him." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Will you return his garden to him?" "Yes,"she said.<P>4973. It is related from 'Ikrima that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The wife of Thabitibn Qays ibn Shammas came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'Messenger of Allah, I do not criticise Thabitin his <I>deen</I> or his character, but I fear ingratitude.' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Will you return his gardento him?' 'Yes,' she said. She returned it to him and he ordered him to partfrom her."<P>'Ikrima related that Jamila (and he related the <I>hadith</I>.)<P><P><B>XII. Discord and whether khul' is suggested when it is necessary.</B><P>The words of Allah,<I> "If you fear a breach between a couple, send an arbiterfrom his people and an arbiter from her people." </I>(4:35)<P>4974. It is related that al-Miswar ibn Makrama said, "I heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'The Banu'l-Mughirahave asked for permission to marry their daughter to 'Ali. I do not givepermission.'"<P><P><B>XIII. Selling a slavegirl does not entail divorce</B><P>4975. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet , may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "There were three sunnas established in connectionwith Barira. The first was that when she was set free, she was given a choice(of remaining married) with her husband. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The <I>wala' </I>belongs to the onewho sets a person free. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, came in when there was a pot with meat on the boil. Bread andcondiments were brought to him from the stock of the house. He said, 'DidI not see a pot with meat in it?' They said, 'Yes, but that is meat whichwas given as <I>sadaqa</I> to Barira, and you do not eat <I>sadaqa</I>.'He said, 'It is <I>sadaqa</I> for her and it is a gift for us.'"<P><P><B>XIV. Giving a slavegirl married to a slave the option (of remaining marriedor not)</B><P>4976. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I saw that he was a slave," meaningthe husband of Barira.<P>4977. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "That was Mughith, the slave ofthe Banu so-and-so," meaning the husband of Barira. "I can visualise himfollowing her through the streets of Madina weeping for her."<P>4978. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Barira's husband was a slave calledMughith, the slave of the Banu so-and-so. I can visualise him now, goingaround behind her through the streets of Madina."<P><P><B>XV. The intercession of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, for Barira's husband</B><P>4979. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said that Barira's husband was a slavecalled Mughith. I can visualise him going around behind her, weeping, withhis tears flowing down his beard. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "'Abbas! Are you not amazed at Mughith's love for Bariraand Barira's hatred for Mughith?" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, asked, "Will you take him back?" She said, "Do you command meto, Messenger of Allah?" He answered, "I am interceding." She said, "I haveno need of him."<P>4980. It is related from al-Aswad that 'A'isha wanted to buy Barira and hermasters wanted to stipulate keeping her <I>wala' </I>as a precondition. 'A'ishamentioned it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, "Buy herand free her. The<I> wala' </I>belongs to the one who sets a person free."She said, "Some meat was brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and I said, 'This was given as <I>sadaqa</I> to Barira.'He said, 'It is <I>sadaqa</I> for her and a gift for us.'"<P>Shu'ba added, "She was given a choice about her husband."<P><P><B>XVI. The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Do not marry idolatrous women untilthey believe. A believing slavegirl is better for you than an idolatress,even though she attract you."</I> (2:221)</B><P>4981. It is related from Nafi' that when Ibn 'Umar was asked about marryinga Christian or Jewish woman, he said, "Allah has made idolatresses unlawfulfor the believers. I do not know of a more terrible shirk than that a womansay, 'My Lord is 'Isa,' when he is one of the slaves of Allah."<P><P><B>XVII. Marrying idolatresses who have become Muslim and their 'idda</B><P>4982. It is related by 'Ata' from Ibn 'Abbas that the idolaters were in twopositions in relation to the Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and the believers. Some were idolaters from the people of war whomthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, fought and who foughthim, and other idolaters were people with a treaty. He did not fight themand they did not fight him, If a woman from the people of war emigrated,she did not receive a marriage proposal until she had menstruated and thenbecome pure. When she was pure, it was lawful for her to marry. If her husbandemigrated before she married, she was returned to him. If a slave or slavegirlemigrated to them, they were free and they had the same rights that the emigrantshad. Then he ('Ata') mentioned the people of treaty as in the hadith of Mujahid.[as in the next section] If a slave or slavegirl of the idolaters who hada treaty emigrated, they were not returned, but their prices were paid tothem.<P>It is reported from Ibn 'Abbas that Qariba bint Abi Umayya was married to'Umar ibn al-Khattab. He divorced her and then Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan marriedher. Umm al-Hakam bint Abi Sufyan was married to 'Iyad ibn Ghanm al-Fihri.He divorced her and 'Abdullah ibn 'Uthman ath-Thaqafi married her.<P><P><B>XVIII. When an idolatress or Christian woman who is married to a dhimmior harbi becomes Muslim</B><P>It is reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When a Christian woman becomes Musliman hour before him, she is forbidden to him."<P>It is reported that 'Ata' was asked about a woman from those with whom thereis a treaty who became Muslim and then her husband became Muslim while shewas still in her 'idda: was she still his wife? 'Ata' said, "No, not unlessshe wishes to marry him with a new marriage and dower.<P>Mujahid said that if he becomes Muslim during her 'idda, he can re-marryher.<P>Allah Almighty says, <I>"They are not lawful for the rejectors nor are therejectors lawful for them." </I>(60:10)<P>Al-Hasan and Qatada said about a Magian couple who become Muslim: they arestill married, but if one becomes a Muslim before the other, and the otherrefuses, there is a final divorce and the husband has no way to her.<P>Ibn Jurayj said, "I asked 'Ata', 'If a woman of the idolaters comes to theMuslims, is her husband compensated for her by the words of Allah, <I>"Givethe rejectors whatever dowry they paid" </I>(60:10)?' 'Ata answered, 'No,That was between the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andthe people of that treaty."<P>Mujahid said, "All of this was in the treaty between the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and Quraysh."<P>4983. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that 'A'isha, the wife of theProphet said, "When believing women emigrated to the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, he could examine them by the words of Allah Almighty,<I>'O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, submitthem to a test...' </I>(60:10)" 'A'isha said, "When any of the believingwomen affirmed this condition, she passed the test. When they verbally affirmedthat, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wouldsay to them, 'Go, I have taken your allegiance.' By Allah, the hand of theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, never touchedthe hand of a woman. He took their allegiance verbally. By Allah, the Messengerof Alla, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, only took from women whatAllah commanded. When he took their allegiance, he told them, 'I have takenyour allegiance' verbally."<P><P><B>XIX. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Those who swear to abstain fromsexual relations with their wives can wait for a period of up to four months.If they then retract their oath, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.If they are determined to divorce, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."</I>(2:226-227)</B><P><I>"Fa-in fa'u"</I> means "retract".<P>4984. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took an oath to stay awayfrom his wives at a time when he had dislocated his foot. He remained inhis upper room for 29 days and then came down. They said, 'Messenger of Allah,did you take an oath for a month?' He replied, 'The month is 29 days.'"<P>4985. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar used to say about the<I>ila'</I> which Allah identified, "After the end of the period, it is notlawful for a person to do other than retain her with kindness or to resolveon divorce as Allah Almighty has commanded."<P>He reported that Ibn 'Umar said, "When four months have passed, then thehusband is detained until he divorces, but there is no divorce until he divorcesher."<P>That was reported from 'Uthman, 'Ali, Abu'd-Darda' and twelve of the Companionsof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P><P><B>XX. The ruling concerning the wife and property of a missing person</B><P>Ibn al-Musayyab said, "When someone goes missing in the battle lines, hiswife waits for a year [before she is free to marry]."<P>Ibn Mas'ud purchased a slavegirl and searched for her owner for a year withoutfinding him as he was missing. He began to give one or two dirhams away andsaid, "O Allah, this is for so-and-so. If he comes, it is for him and forme." He said, "This is what you should do in the case of something that youfind."<P>Az-Zuhri said about a captive whose location is known, "His wife does notremarry and his property is not divided. When there is no further news ofhim, then his case becomes that of someone who is missing."<P>4986. It is related that Yazid, the client of al-Munba'ith, said that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked about a lostsheep. He said, "Take it. It is for you, your brother or the wolf." He wasasked about a lost camel and he became angry and face became red. He said,"It has nothing to do with you. It has its feet and its water and it willfind water and graze from the trees until its owner finds it." The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked about finding a lost article.He said, "Note its string and container, and then publicise it for a year.If its owner comes, give it to him, Otherwise, add it to your property."<P>Sufyan said, "I met Rabi'a ibn Abi 'Abdu'r-Rahman." Sufyan said, "This isall that I memorised from him." I said, "Do you think that the hadith ofYazid, the client of al-Munba'ith, about the lost animal is from Zayd ibnKhalid?" "Yes," he answered. Rabi'a said it is from Yazid, the client ofal-Munba'ith, from Zayd ibn Khalid. Sufyan said that he met Rabi'a and spoketo him.<P><P><B>XXI. <I>Zihar</I> Divorce</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Allah has heard the words of the woman whodisputes with you about her husband and lays her complaint before Allah</I>...to ...<I> And anyone who is unable to do that must feed sixty poorpeople."</I> (58:1-4)<P>It is related that Malik asked Ibn Shihab about the <I>zihar</I> done bya slave. He said, "It is like that <I>zihar</I> of a free person." Maliksaid that a slave fasts for two months.<P>Al-Hasan ibn al-Hurr said that a <I>zihar</I> by a free person and a slavefrom a free woman or a slavegirl is the same.<P>'Ikrima said, "If someone pronounces a <I>zihar</I> in regard to his slavegirl,it means nothing. A <I>zihar</I> is only done with wives."<P>In Arabic <I>"lima qalu" </I>(58:3) means "on what they said" and is to nullifywhat they said. This is more appropriate because Allah does not direct tothe objectionable or falsehood.<P><P><B>XXII. Using gestures in divorce and other matters</B><P>Ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Allah will not punish on account of the tears of the eyes, but Hewill punish on account of this," and he pointed to his tongue.<P>Ka'b ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,gestured to me to take half."<P>Asma' said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayedin an eclipse and I said to 'A'isha, 'What are the people doing?' She waspraying and she indicated the sun with her head. I asked, 'Is it a sign?'and she nodded with her head in affirmation."<P>Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gesturedwith his hand that Abu Bakr should go forward [to lead the prayer]."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, indicatedwith a gesture of his hand that there was no harm."<P>Abu Qatada said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidabout game for someone in <I>ihram</I>, 'Did any of you command him to attackit or point at it?' They replied, 'No.' He said, 'Then eat.'"<P>4987. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, performed tawaf on his camel. Whenever hereached the Corner, he pointed with his hand and said the <I>takbir</I>."Zaynab said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'An opening has been made in the wall of Ya'juj and Ma'juj like this,' andhe formed the shape of the number 90 [with his thumb and forefinger]."<P>4988. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'There is an hour in Friday such that if anyMuslim is standing in prayer at that moment and he asks Allah for good, Hewill give it to him.'" He put his finger tips on the inside of the middlefinger and little finger." We said, "He is computing it."<P>4989. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that in the time of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a Jew attacked a girland took some silver jewellery that she was wearing and crushed her head.Her family brought her to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, while she was close to death and was rendered speechless. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, "Who killedyou? So-and-so?" mentioning someone other than the person who had killedher. She indicated it was not. He said, "So-and-so?" naming her killer andshe indicated that it was. So the Messenger of Allah* ordered that his headbe crushed between two stones."<P>4990. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Trial (<I>fitna</I>) willcome from here,' pointing to the east."<P>4991. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa said, "We were with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey. When thesun set, he said to a man, 'Get down and mix some <I>sawiq</I> for me.' Hesaid, 'Messenger of Allah, will you wait until evening?' Then he said, 'Getdown and mix some <I>sawiq</I> for me.' He said, 'Messenger of Allah, willyou wait until evening? It is still day.' Then he said again, 'Get down andmix some <I>sawiq</I> for me.' The third time he dismounted and mixed some<I>sawiq</I> for him and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, drank and then gestured with his hand towards the east andsaid, 'When you see the night advancing from here, then the faster can breakhis fast.'"<P>4992. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet , may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "One of you (or none among you) shouldlet the call &#150; or <I>adhan</I> &#150; of Bilal stop you from eatingyour <I>suhur</I>. He calls &#150; or gives the <I>adhan</I> &#150; so thatone praying can stop. He is not saying that it is <I>Subh</I> or time for<I>Fajr</I>." Yazid (the narrator) showed his hands and then stretched eachof them from the other.<P>4993. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The likeness of the miser and the onewho gives is like two men wearing shirts of chain-mail from their breaststo their collar bones. When the giver of <I>sadaqa</I> spends, his shirtexpands over his body until it covers his fingertips and obliterates hisfootsteps. When the miser wants to spend anything, every link remains inits place. He tries to make it looser but it will not get looser." He pointedwith his finger at his throat.<P><P><B>XXIII. The<I> Li'an</I></B><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Those who make an accusation against theirwives and have no witnesses except themselves, the legal proceeding of sucha one is to testify four times by Allah that he is telling the truth anda fifth time that Allah's curse will be upon him if he is lying. And thepunishment is removed from her if she testifies four times by Allah thathe is lying and a fifth time that Allah's anger will be upon her if he speaksthe truth." </I>(24:6-9)<P>If a mute man slanders* his wife by writing, indicating or pointing in aknown manner, he is like someone who articulates that in words because theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, allowed gestures in obligatoryacts. That is the view of some of people of the Hijaz** and the people ofknowledge. Allah Almighty says, "But she (Mary) pointed to him (Jesus). Theysaid,<I> "She pointed towards him. They said, 'How can a child in the cradlespeak?'"</I> (19:29) Ad-Dahhak said that <I>"illa ramza"</I> (3:41) meansonly with gestures.<P>Someone [Abu Hanifa] said that there is no <I>hadd</I> or<I> li'an</I> (basedon gesture), and then he said that it is permitted for divorce to occur bywriting, pointing or gesture. There is no difference between divorce andslander. If he says that slander only occurs through words, he is told, 'Thenthe same is true of divorce. It is not permitted by words. Otherwise bothdivorce and slander are invalid." The same is true of emancipation. The personwho is deaf can carry out a<I> li'an</I>.<P>Ash-Sha'bi and Qatada said, "If someone says, 'You are divorced,' and pointswith his fingers, then it is clear by his gesture."<P>Ibrahim said, "If a mute person writes out the divorce with his hand, itis binding."<P>Hammad ***said, "If a mute or deaf person uses his head, or indicates withhis head, it is allowed."<P>[* Slander here is <I>qadhf</I>, which is to accuse of illicit sex.<P>** Meaning Malik and those who followed him. The people of knowledge meansAbu Thawr.<P>*** Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman, the shaykh of Abu Hanifa.]<P>4994. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Shall I tell you which are thebest houses of the Ansar?" "Yes, indeed, Messenger of Allah." they answered.He said, "The Banu'n-Najjar, then after them the Banu al-Ashhal, then theBanu'-Harith ibn al-Khazraj, then the Banu Sa'ida." Then he clenched hisfingers and opened them like someone throwing something with his hand andsaid, "There is good in all the houses of the Ansar."<P>4995. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi, the Companion of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was heard to say thatthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Mybeing sent and the Final Hour are like these two," and he put together hismiddle and index fingers.<P>4996. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "The month is like this, this and this," i.e.thirty. Then he said, "And like this, this and this," meaning 29. He indicatedthirty once and 29 once.<P>4997. It is related that Abu Mas'ud said, "Belief is there," and he pointedtowards Yemen. "But cruelty and hard-heartedness are in those with loud voiceswho are following the tails of camels where the horns of Shaytan appear -Rabi' and Mudar."<P>4998. It is related from Sahl that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "I and the one who cares for an orphans willbe like this in the Garden," and he indicated his middle and index fingersand slightly parted them.<P><P><B>XXIV. When someone alludes to denial of paternity</B><P>4999. It is related from Abu Hurayra that a man came to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Messenger of Allah, a black childhas been born to me." He asked him, "Do you have camels?" "Yes," the manreplied. He asked, "What colour are they?" "Red," he answered. He asked,"Is there a grey one among them?" "Yes," he replied. He said, "Where doesthat come from?" He said, "Perhaps it is a throwback in the bloodline." Hesaid, "Perhaps this son of yours is a throwback.'"<P><P><B>XXV. Making those involved in the <I>li'an</I> are made to swear oaths</B><P>5000. It is related from 'Abdullah [ibn 'Umar] that a man of the Ansar slanderedhis wife and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made themboth swear oaths and then separated them."<P><P><B>XXVI. The man goes first in the<I> li'an</I></B><P>5001. It was related from Ibn 'Abbas that Hilal ibn Umayya slandered hiswife and came and testified. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent?"Then the woman got up and testified.<P><P><B>XXVII. The<I> li'an</I> and the one who divorced after the<I>li'an</I></B><P>5002. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi reported that 'Umaymiral-'Ajlani came to 'Asim ibn 'Adi al-Ansari and said to him, "'Asim, whatdo you say about a man who finds another man with his wife? Should he killhim and then you kill him in turn? What else should he do? 'Asim, ask theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about that.''Asim asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,about that, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, disliked such questions and considered them to be blameworthy. What'Asim heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,say was hard on him. When 'Asim returned to his family, 'Umaymir came andsaid, ''Asim, what did the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, say to you?' 'Asim said, 'You have not brought me any good! TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, disliked thequestion which I asked him about.' 'Uwaymir said, 'By Allah, I will not stopuntil I ask the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,about that!'<P>"So 'Uwaymir went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, who was in the middle of the people and said, 'Messenger of Allah,if a man finds another man with his wife, should he kill him and then youkill him in turn? What else should he do?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah has sent down revelation aboutyou and your wife. Go and bring her.'"<P>Sahl said, "They cursed one another while I was with the people in the presenceof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When they finished,'Umaymir said, 'I would be lying about her if I were to keep her, Messengerof Allah.' So he divorced her three times before the Messenger of Allah ,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded him to do so."<P>Ibn Shihab said, "That was the <I>sunna</I> for those who curse one anotherin the<I> li'an</I>." [Same as 8185]<P><P><B>XXVIII. Carrying out the<I> li'an </I>in the mosque</B><P>5003. Ibn Jurayj said, "Ibn Shihab told me about the <I>li'an</I> and the<I>sunna</I> from the <I>hadith</I> of Sahl ibn Sa'd, the brother of theBanu Sa'ida. A man of the Ansar went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, what do yousay about a man who finds another man with his wife? Should he kill him orwhat should he do?' So Allah revealed about her what is mentioned in theQur'an about the couple who carry out the <I>li'an</I>. The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah has given a decision aboutyou and your wife.' He said, 'They cursed each other in the mosque whileI was present. When they finished, he said, 'I would be lying about her ifI were to keep her, Messenger of Allah.' So he divorced her three times beforethe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commandedhim to do so when they finished the <I>li'an</I>. So he parted from her withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. That is how every couplewho carries out the <I>li'an </I>are divorced.'"<P>Ibn Shihab said, "The <I>sunna</I> after them was that a couple who pronouncedthe <I>li'an</I> were divorced. She was pregnant and her son was called byhis mother's name." He said, "The <I>sunna</I> in her inheritance was thatshe inherited from him and she from him according to the share which Allahallotted him.<P>Ibn Shihab reported from Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi in this <I>hadith</I> thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;said, "If shehas a small reddish child like the wahra lizard (white with reddish spots),then I think that she has spoken the truth and he lied about her. If shehas a child with black eyes and large buttocks, then I think that he spokethe truth about her." She had a child with the disliked description.<P><P><B>XXIX. The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"If I were to stone someone without evidence..."</B><P>5004. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas: "The <I>li'an </I>was mentioned in thepresence of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. 'Asim ibn'Adi said something about that and then left. A man from his people had cometo him to complain that he had found a man with his wife. 'Asim said, 'Ihave not suffered in this except for what I said.' 'Asim brought the manto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he told himabout how he had found his wife. That man was pale, thin with straight hair.The man he claimed that he had found with his wife had fat calves and forearms,dark brown skin, and was corpulent. The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'O Allah! Make things clear!' She bore a child wholooked like the same as the man whom her husband mentioned that he had foundher with. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had themcarry out the <I>li'an</I>."<P>A man asked Ibn 'Abbas in the gathering, "Was she the woman about whom theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If I were to stonesomeone without evidence, I would have stoned this one'?" He said, 'No, thatwas a woman who made a show a lewdness although she was Muslim."<P>Abu Salih and 'Abdullah ibn Yusuf said <I>khadlan</I> (with fat calves andforearms).<P><P><B>XXX. The dower of a woman divorced by<I> li'an</I></B><P>5005. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, 'I said to Ibn 'Umar, 'Whathappens if a man slanders his wife?' He replied, 'The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, separated the couple of the Banu'l-'Ajlanand said, 'Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent?'They both refused. He said again, 'Allah knows that one of you is lying.Will one of you repent?' They both refused. He said again, 'Allah knows thatone of you is lying. Will one of you repent?' They both refused. So he separatedthem.<P>Ayyub said, "'Amr ibn Dinar said to me, 'There is something else in the<I>hadith</I> which I do not see you recount. The man said, 'And my money?'It was said, 'You have no money. If you spoke the truth, you consummatedthe marriage by paying it. If you lie, it is even further from you.'"<P><P><B>XXXI. The ruler saying to the couple doing a<I> li'an</I>, "One of youis lying. Will one of you repent?"</B><P>5006. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr was heard to say, "I asked Ibn'Umar about a couple involved in the <I>li'an</I>. He said, 'The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to the couple in the<I>li'an</I>, "Your reckoning is up to Allah. One of you is lying, and youhave no way against the woman." He asked, "And my money?" He said, "You haveno money. If you spoke the truth about her, it was to render her privateparts lawful for you. If you lied about her, then that is even further fromyou."<P>Sufyan said, "I memorised it from 'Amr."<P>Ayyub said, "I heard Sa'id ibn Jubayr say, 'I asked Ibn 'Umar, "What if aman is separated from his wife by a <I>li'an</I>?" He answered by puttingtwo of his fingers apart &#150; and Sufyan put his index and middle fingersapart. "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, separated thecouple of the Banu'l-'Ajlan and said, 'Allah knows that one of you is lying.Will one of you repent?' three times.'"<P>Sufyan said, "I memorised it from 'Amr and Ayyub as I have told you."<P><P><B>XXXII.

It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, carried out the <I>li'an </I>on a man andhis wife and the husband denied the paternity of her child. They were separatedand the child was attached to the woman [i.e. and not to the man.]."<P><P><B>XXXIV. The words of the imam, "O Allah, make it clear!"</B><P>5010. It is related that Ibn al-'Abbas said, "The couple involved in a<I>li'an</I> were mentioned in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace.

'Asim said, 'I have not suffered in this exceptfor what I said.' He took him to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and he told him about how he had found his wife.That man was pale, thin, with straight hair. The man he claimed that he hadfound with his wife was brown skinned, with fat forearms and calves, corpulentand with very curly hair.

It is related from Zaynab bint Abi Salama from her mother, Umm Salama,the wife of the Prophet, &nbsp;may Allah bless him and grant him peace, thata woman of Aslam called Subay'a was married to a man who died while she waspregnant. Abu's-Sanabil ibn Ba'kak proposed to her but she refused to marryhim. She* said, "By Allah, it is not proper for you to marry him until youhave observed the last of the two periods of 'idda. About ten days latershe went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and hesaid, "Marry."<P>[*One variant has "He said", referring to Abu's-Sanabil.]<P>5013. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah reported that his father wrote to Ibn al-Arqamasking him to ask Subay'a al-Aslamiyya what decision the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, had given her. She said, "He gave me the decisionthat when I had given birth, I could then marry."<P>5014. It is related from al-Miswar ibn Makhrama that Subay'a al-Aslamiyyagave birth some days after the death of her husband, and she went to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and asked his permissionto marry and he gave her permission and so she got married.<P><P><B>XXXVIII. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Divorced women should wait bythemselves for three menstrual cycles."</I> (2:228)</B><P>Ibrahim [an-Nakha'i] said about a woman who married during the<I> 'idda </I>andhad three periods while with him, that she is divorced from the first andthere is no reckoning for the one after him [because the second marriageis invalid]. Az-Zuhri said that there is reckoning. This is what Sufyanpreferred, i.e the verdict of az-Zuhri.<P>Ma'mar said, "It was asked, 'Is it a <I>qar' </I>(monthly period) when hermenstruation comes or when her purity comes?' It is said that there is no<I>qar'</I> by the membrane [of the foetus) alone and when is no child inher womb." [This means that <I>qar' </I>are only calculated by menstrualperiods and periods of purity.]<P><P><B>XXXIX. The story of Fatima bint Qays</B><P>The words of Allah,<I> "And show fear of Allah, your Lord. Do not evict themfrom their homes, nor should they leave, unless they commit an outrightindecency. Those are Allah's limits, and anyone who oversteps Allah's limitshas wronged himself. You never know, it may be that after that, Allah willcause a new situation to develop."</I> (65:1)<P><I>"Let them live where you live, according to your means. Do not put pressureon them, so as to harass them. If they are pregnant, maintain them untilthey give birth. If they are suckling for you, give them their wages andconsult together with correctness and courtesy. But if you make things difficultfor one another, another woman should do the suckling for you. He who hasplenty should spend out from his plenty. But he whose provision is restrictedshould spend from what Allah has given him. Allah does not charge any selfwith more than He has given it. Allah will appoint after difficulty, ease."</I>(65:6-7)<P>5015. It is related that al-Qasim ibn Muhammad and Sulayman ibn Yasar wereheard to mention that Yahya ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As divorced the daughter of'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Hakam. 'Abdu'r-Rahman then moved his daughter fromher house. 'A'isha, the Mother of the Believers, sent to Marwan ibn al-Hakam,the amir of Madina, "Fear Allah and return her to her house." In Sulayman's<I>hadith</I>, Marwan said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Hakam overcame me." Al-Qasimibn Muhammad has that Marwan said, "Have you not heard of the case of Fatimabint Qays?" She said, "You have no argument in mentioning the <I>hadith</I>of Fatima." Marwan ibn al-Hakam said, "If you say it [that ruling about her]was because of evil, then there is enough evil between these two."<P>5016. It is related from al-Qasim that 'A'isha said, "What is wrong withFatima? Does she not fear Allah?" i.e. in saying that there is no residenceor maintenance (for a divorced woman).<P>5017. It is related from al-Qasim, "'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said to 'A'isha,'Have you not seen so-and-so, the daughter of al-Hakam? Her husband divorcedher irrevocably and she left (the house).' She said, 'How bad is what shehas done!' He said, 'Have you not heard what Fatima said?' She said, 'Itis of no good to her to mention this <I>hadith</I>.'"<P>'Urwa said, "'A'isha criticised this severely and said, 'Fatima was in anisolated place and was exposed to danger. That is while the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, gave her an allowance [to move fromthere]."<P><P><B>XL. If a divorced woman fears in her husband's house that she might beattacked or speak badly to his family</B><P>5018. It is related from 'Urwa that 'A'isha objected to Fatima doing that[i.e. moving from her husband's house].<P><P><B>XLI. The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"It is not lawful for them to concealwhat Allah has created in their wombs" </I>(2:228) meaning menstruation orpregnancy</B><P>5019. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, wanted to leave Makka, he saw Safiyyaat the door of her tent &nbsp;looking sad. He said to her, 'What a nusiance!You will hold us up. Did you perform <I>tawaf al-ifada</I> on the Day ofSacrifice?' 'Yes,' she replied. He said, 'Depart then.'"<P><P><B>XLIII. <I>"Their husbands have the right to take them back within thattime" </I>(2:228) during the 'idda. How one takes back a wife when he hasdivorced her once or twice.</B><P>5020. It is related that al-Hasan said, "Ma'qil gave his sister is marriageand (her husband) divorced her once."<P>5021. It is related from al-Hasan that the sister of Ma'qil ibn Yasar wasmarried to a man who divorced her and remained away from her until her 'iddaended. Then he proposed to her and Ma'qil was angry out of pride and said,"He kept away from her when he could keep her and now he proposes to heragain?" He came between him and her and so Allah revealed, <I>"When you divorcewomen and they reach the end of their waiting-period, do not prevent themfrom marrying their first husbands ..." </I>(2:232) The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, summoned him and recited it to himand so he set aside his anger and obeyed the command of Allah.<P>5022. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar ibn al-Khattab divorced hiswife with a single divorce while she was menstruating. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered him to take her back andkeep her until she was pure and then menstruated again while with him. Thenhe was to wait until she was pure after that period. Then he if he wantedto divorce her, he could divorce her while she was pure before having intercoursewith her. "That is the <I>'idda</I> which Allah has commanded when womenare divorced."<P>When 'Abdullah was asked about that, he said to one of them, "If you divorceher three times, then she is unlawful for you until she has married a husbandother than you."<P>Another reported from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar said, "Would that you had pronouncedone or two divorces. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,commanded me to do that."<P><P><B>XLIII. Taking back a menstruating woman</B><P>5023. It is related that Yunus ibn Jubayr said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar and hesaid that Ibn 'Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. 'Umar askedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who commanded him totake her back and then divorce her before the end of the <I>'idda</I>. Iasked, 'Is that considered to be a divorce?' He said, 'What would you thinkif he were incapacitated and foolish?'"<P><P><B>XLIV. A widow should mourn for four months and ten days</B><P>Az-Zuhri said, "I do not think that a widowed girl (i.e. one who has notyet reached puberty) should use perfume because she still has to observethe<I> 'idda</I>."<P>5024. It is related from Humayd ibn Nafi' that Zaynab bint Abi Salama toldhim these three <I>hadiths</I>. Zaynab said, "I visited Umm Habiba, the wifeof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when her father,Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, had died. Umm Habiba called for yellow scent &#150;khaluq or something else. She put some of it on the slavegirl and then wipedit on her cheeks and said, 'By Allah, I have no need of perfume, but I heardthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Itis not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mournfor a dead person more than three days unless it is her husband. She shouldmourn him for four months and ten days.'"<P>Zaynab said, "I visited Zaynab bint Jahsh when her brother had died. Sheasked for scent and put it on and then said, 'I only put on perfume becauseI heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,say on the minbar, "It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah andthe Last Day to mourn for a dead person more than three days unless it isher husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days."'"<P>Zaynab said, "I heard Umm Salama say, 'A woman* came to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger of Allah,my daughter's husband has died and she has an eye complaint. Can she usekohl?" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace,&nbsp;said "No" two or three times. Every time he said "No." Then theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "It [mourning]is only four months and ten days. In the Jahiliyya, one of you would throwa piece of dung after a year."'"<P>[*This was 'Atika bint Nu'aym]<P>Humayd said, "I asked Zaynab, 'What is meant by throwing a piece of dungafter a year?' Zaynab replied, 'When a woman was widowed, she would entera very small room [or small tent], put on her worse clothes and would nottouch any perfume until a year had passed. Then an animal would be broughtto her: a donkey, a sheep or a bird, and rub herself against it. Rarely didshe rub herself against any animal which did not subsequently die. Then shewould come out and be given a piece of dung which she would throw. Then shecould resume using perfume and other things. Malik was asked what she rubbedagainst it and he said that she rubbed it against her skin.<P><P><B>XLV. Use of kohl by a woman in mourning</B><P>5025. It is related from Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salama from her motherthat a woman was widowed and they feared for her eyes and went to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and asked him for permissionfor to use kohl. He said, "She should not use kohl. One of you would remainin the worst of her clothes or the worst room and after a year, if a dogpassed by her, she would throw a piece of dung. Now (mourning) is only forfour months and ten days."<P>Humayd said, "I heard Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salama, reporting fromUmm Habiba that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"It is not lawful for a Muslim woman who believes in Allah and the Last Dayto mourn for a dead person more than three unless it is her husband. Sheshould mourn him for four months and ten days."<P>5026. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said, "We were forbidden to mourn formore than three days except for a husband."<P><P><B>XLVI. Use of qust* by a mourning woman when she purifies herself</B><P>5027. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said, "We were forbidden to mourn someonefor more than three days except for a husband, who is mourned for four monthsand ten days. We should not use kohl or perfume nor wear dyed clothes, exceptfor <I>'asb</I> garments**. We were allowed in purification when one of ushad performed a ghusl after menstruation to use a bit of kust azfar. We wereforbidden to follow funeral processions."<P>[*Qust or kust is costus, an aromatic food used for fumigation. It is alsomedicinal.

A woman in mourning wearing<I> 'asb</I> garments</B><P>5028. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said, "It is not lawful for a womanwho believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for a dead person more thanthree days unless it is her husband. She should not use kohl or dyed clothesexcept for an 'asb garment."<P>It is related from Hafsa from Umm 'Atiyya, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, forbade her to use perfume except when she firstbecomes pure when she can use a piece of qust and azfar."<P>Abu 'Abdullah [al-Bukhari] said, "<I>Qust</I> and <I>kust</I> are like<I>kafur</I> and <I>qafur</I>." <I>Nubdha</I> means a piece.<P><P><B>XLVIII. <I>"Those of you who die leaving wives behind: they should waitby themselves for four months and ten nights. When their waiting-period comesto an end, you are not to blame for anything they do with themselves withcorrectness and courtesy. Allah is aware of everything you do."</I>(2:234)</B><P>5029. It is related about <I>"Those of you who die leaving wives behind</I>"that Mujahid said, "This was the 'idda which she was obliged to spend inthe house of her husband. Allah had revealed, <I>'Those of you who die leavingwives behind should make a bequest to their wives of maintenance for a yearwithout having to leave their homes. But if they do leave you are not toblame for anything they do with themselves with correctness and courtesy.'</I>(2:240) Allah allowed her to complete the year with seven months andtwenty days as a bequest. If she wished, she could stay according to herbequest, and if she wished, she could leave as stated by Allah, '<I>withouthaving to leave their homes. But if they do leave you are not to blame</I>.'The 'idda is as has been obliged on her." He claimed that Mujahid said that.<P>It is reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, "This ayat abrogated her 'idda withher husband's household and she does the 'idda wherever she wishes. Allahsays, "<I>without having to leave their home</I>s'." 'Ata' said, "If shewished, she could do the<I> 'idda</I> with her husband's house and live accordingto his bequest. If she wished, she could leave by the words of Allah, '<I>youare not to blame for anything they do with themselves</I>s.'" 'Ata' said,"Then inheritance came [in the Qur'an] and residence was abrogated, and soshe does the 'idda wherever she wishes and is not entitled to residence."<P>5030. It is related by Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salama, that when UmmHabiba bint Abi Sufyan was informed about her father's death, she calledfor perfume and rubbed it on her arms, saying, "I have no need of perfumewhere it not that I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, say, 'It is not lawful for a Muslim woman who believes in Allah andthe Last Day to mourn for a dead person more than three unless it is herhusband. She should mourn him for four months and ten days.'"<P><P><B>XLIX. The prices of prostitutes and invalid marriage</B><P>Al-Hasan said, "When someone marries a woman forbidden by lineage while heis not unaware of that, they are separated and she has what she took (asa dower) and nothing else. Then he said after that, "She takes her dower."<P>5031. It is related that Abu Mas'ud said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, forbade the price of a dog, the fee of a soothsayerand the price of prostitutes."<P>5032. It is related that Abu Juhayfa said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, cursed women who tattoo and women who are tattooed,those who take usury and those who pay it, and he forbade the price for dogsand the earnings of prostitutes and cursed those who make images."<P>5033. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, forbade the earnings of slavegirls [from prostitution].<P><P><B>L. The dower of a woman whose marriage is consummated, and how one goesin to her, &nbsp;and what happens if he divorces her before consummationand touching</B><P>5034. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I asked Ibn 'Umar, 'Whatif a man slanders his wife?' He answered, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, separated the couple of the Banu'l-'Ajlan and said,'Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent?' They bothrefused. He said again, 'Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will one ofyou repent?' They both refused. So he separated them."<P>Ayyub said, "'Amr ibn Dinar said to me, 'There is something else in the<I>hadith</I> which I do not see you recount. The man said, 'And my money?'It was said, 'You have no money. If you spoke the truth, you consummatedthe marriage with her. If you lie, it is even further from you.'"<P><P><B>LI. There is a gift for a woman for whom a dower has not been determined</B><P>By the words of the Almighty, <I>"There is nothing wrong in your divorcingwomen before you have touched them or allotted them a dowry. But give thema gift &#150; he who is wealthy according to his means and he who is lesswell off according to his means &#150; a gift to be given with correctnessand courtesy: a duty for all good-doers. If you divorce them before you havetouched them but have already allotted them a dowry, they should have halfthe amount you allotted, unless they forgo it or the one in charge of themarriage contract forgoes it. To forgo it is closer to being godfearing.Do not forget to show generosity to one another. Allah sees everything youdo." </I>(2:236-237)<P>And His words,<I> "Divorced women should receive maintenance given withcorrectness and courtesy: a duty for all godfearing people. Thus does Allahmake His Signs clear to you, so that perhaps you will use your intellect."</I>(2:241-242)<P>The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not mention a giftfor the woman divorced by a <I>li'an</I> when her husband divorced her.<P>5030. It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to the couple involved in the<I>li'an</I>, "Your reckoning is up to Allah. One of you is lying, and you haveno way against the woman." He asked, "And my money?" He said, "You have nomoney. If you spoke the truth about her, it was for her private parts becominglawful for you.

Thus does Allah make theSigns clear to you, so that perhaps you will reflect on this world and theNext."</I> (2:219-220)<P>Al-Hasan said that <I>'afw </I>means surplus.<P>5036. It is related that Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari said that the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When a Muslim spends on his familyin anticipation of a reward, it is <I>sadaqa</I> for him."<P>5037. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Allah says, 'Spend, son of Adam, and I will spendon you."<P>5038. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Someone who strives to provide for widows andthe poor is like someone who does jihad in the Way of Allah or the one whostands in prayer at night and fasts in the day."<P>5039. It is related that Sa'd said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, used to visit me in Makka while I was ill. I said, 'I haveproperty. May I will away all of my property?' 'No,' he answered. 'Half?'I asked. 'No,' he replied. 'A third?' I said. He replied, 'A third, and athird is a lot. It is better to leave your heirs rich than to leave thempoor, begging from other people. Whatever you spend on support is<I>sadaqa</I>, even the morsel you put in your wife's mouth. Perhaps Allahmay lengthen your life so that some people benefit by you and others willbe harmed by you."<P><P><B>II. The obligation of supporting one's family and dependants.</B><P>5040. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'The best <I>sadaqa</I> is one which leavesone still wealthy. The upper hand is better than the lower hand. Begin withyour dependants. A wife says, 'Either feed me or divorce me.' A slave says,'Feed me and put me to work.' A son says, 'Feed me. To whom will you leaveme?'" They said, "Abu Hurayra, did you hear that from the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace?" "No, he said, "it is from theunderstanding of Abu Hurayra."<P>5041. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The best <I>sadaqa</I> is that givenby the wealthy. Begin with your dependents."<P><P><B>III. A man setting aside the maintenance for his family in the form offood for a year in advance and how one supports his dependants</B><P>5042. Ibn 'Uyayna said, "Ma'mar told me that ath-Thawri had asked him, 'Haveyou heard anything about a man who collects together the food for his familyfor a year or part of year?' Ma'mar said, 'Nothing came to mind and thenI remembered a <I>hadith</I> which Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri had reported to usfrom Malik ibn Aws from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, used to sell the dates of the palm trees of Banu'n-Nadirand would store the food for a year for his family.'"<P>5043. It is related from Malik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadathan &#150; and Muhammadibn Jubayr ibn Mut'im mentioned some of the <I>hadith</I>: "I went to visit'Umar. (While I was there), his chamberlain Yarfa' came to him and said,'Will you admit 'Uthman, 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf, az-Zubayr, and Sa'd whoare asking permission to enter?' He said, 'Yes.' So he gave them permissionand they entered, greeted and sat down. Shortly later he then came and said,'Will you admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?' He said, 'Yes.' He gave them permissionand when they entered they greeted and then sat down. 'Abbas said, 'Amiral-Mu'minin! Judge between me and this one!' The group of 'Uthman and hiscompanions said, 'O Amir al-Mu'minin! Judge between them and relieve oneof the other.' 'Umar said, 'Be patient. I adjure you by Allah by whose permissionthe heaven and earth subsist, do you know that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "We do not bequeath inheritance.What we leave is sadaqa," and that he meant himself?' The group said, 'Hesaid that.' 'Umar turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas, and said, 'I adjure you by Allah,do you know that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said that?' They both said, 'He said that.' He said, 'I will talkto you about this matter. Allah singled out His Messenger, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, in these spoils something which he did not giveanyone else. Allah says, <I>"Whatever booty from them Allah has given toHis Messenger &#150; and you spurred on neither horse nor camel in itsacquisition, but Allah gives power to His Messengers over anyone He wills,Allah has power over all things." </I>(59:6) This was specially for the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he did not appropriateit to your exclusion, and he did not prefer himself with it against you.He gave it to you and distributed it among you until this property remainedof it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, usedto spend on his family the maintenance of a year from this property. Thenwhat remained he made the property of Allah. The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, did that during his lifetime. I adjureyou Allah, do you know that?' 'They all said, 'Yes.' He said to 'Ali and'Abbas, 'I adjure you Allah, do you know that?' They both said, 'Yes.'<P>"'Then Allah took the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andAbu Bakr said, "I am the successor of the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace.' So Abu Bakr took it and acted with it as the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had acted, and you bothwere there.' Then he turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, 'You both claimthat Abu Bakr did this and that, and Allah knows best that in it he was truthful,pious, right-guided, following the truth. Then Allah took Abu Bakr and Isaid, "I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and Abu Bakr. I held it under my control for two yearsduring which I acted in it as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and Abu Bakr acted. Allah knows that I was truthful,pious, right-guided, following the truth in it. Then you two came to talkto me, and you both said the same thing and had the same case. You ('Abbas)came to me, and asked for your share from your nephew and this one ('Ali)asked me for the share of his wife from her father. I said, "If you wish,I will hand it over to you on the basis that you take the pledge and pactof Allah to act in it as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, acted in it and as Abu Bakr acted in it and as I acted init since I took charge. Otherwise, do not speak to me about it," and youboth said, "Hand it over to us on that basis," and I handed it over to youon that basis.' The group said, 'Yes.' 'Umar turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas andsaid, 'I adjure you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on that basis?' Theyboth answered, 'Yes.' He said, 'So are you now seeking from me a decisionother than that? By Allah by whose permission the heaven and earth subsist,I would not give a decision in it other than that until the Last Hour comes!If you are incapable of it, then give it to me and I will spare you of it.'"<P><P><B>IV. The words of Allah Almighty</B>, <I>"Mothers should nurse their childrenfor two full years &#150; those who wish to complete the full term of nursing.It is the duty of the fathers to feed and clothe them with correctness andcourtesy. No self is charged beyond what it can bear. No mother should beput under pressure in respect of her child nor any father in respect of hischild. The same duty is incumbent on the heir. If the couple both wish weaningto take place after mutual agreement and consultation, there is nothing wrongin their doing that. If you wish to find wet-nurses for your children, thereis nothing wrong in your doing that provided you hand over to them what youhave agreed to give with correctness and courtesy. Show fear of Allah andknow that Allah sees everything you do." </I>(2:233)<P>He said<I>, "But if you make things difficult for one another, another womanshould do the suckling for you. He who has plenty should spend out from hisplenty. But he whose provision is restricted should spend from what Allahhas given him. Allah does not charge any self with more than He has givenit.
