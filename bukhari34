Chapter. How the Revelation descended and the first of it to berevealed.</BIG></B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said that "<I>muhaymin</I>" (5l:48) means "trustworthy." The Qur'anis the gurantor of every Book before it.<P>4694. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas and 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, remained for ten years in Makka while theQur'an was being revealed to him, and for ten years in Madina."<P>4695. It is related that Abu 'Uthman said, "I was informed that Jibril cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was withUmm Salama. He began to speak and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, asked Umm Salama, 'Who is this?' She replied, 'It is Dihya.' Whenhe left, she said, 'By Allah, I only thought it was him until I heard the<I>khutba</I> of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, inwhich reported what Jibril had said,' or words to that effect." Ubayy said,"I asked Abu 'Uthman, 'From whom did you hear this?' He replied, 'From Usamaibn Zayd.'"<P>4696. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "There is no Prophet who has not been given [miracles]such that the people believe in him. That which I have been given is Revelationwhich Allah has revealed to me. I hope that I will be the one with most withthe most followers on the Day of Rising."<P>4697. It is related that Anas ibn Malik reported that Allah made the revelationcontinuous to His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, beforehis death so that that was the period of the most revelation up until hisdeath. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,died after that.<P>4698. Jundub was heard to say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was ill and did not rise to pray at night for one or two nights.A woman* came to him and said, 'Muhammad, I only think that your shaytanhas left you!' Then Allah revealed, <I>'By the brightness of the morningand the night when it is still, your Lord has not abandoned you nor doesHe hate you.' </I>(93:1-4)"<P>[* Umm Jamil, the wife of Abu Lahab.]<P><P><B><BIG>II: The Qur'an was revealed in the language of Quraysh and theArabs</BIG></B><P><I>"An Arabic Qur'an" </I>(12:2) and <I>"in clear Arabic language" </I>(26:195)<P>4699. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "'Uthman commanded Zayd ibnThabit, Sa'id ibn al-'As, 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibnal-Harith ibn Hisham to write out copies of the Qur'an. He told them, "Whenyou and Zayd ibn Thabit disagree about the Arabic of the Qur'an, you shouldwrite it in the language of Quraysh. The Qur'an was revealed in their tongue.'They did that."<P>4700. It is related from Safwan ibn Ya'la ibn Umayya that Ya'la used to say,"I used to want to see the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, while he was receiving revelation. While the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was at al-Ji'rana, shaded by a garment abovehim in the company of&nbsp;some of his Companions, a man wearing perfumecame to him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, what do you think about a manwho goes into ihram in a cloak after putting on scent?' The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, waited for a time and then revelationcame upon him." 'Umar beckoned to Ya'la to come and put his head (under thecloth). His face was red and he was breathing heavily. That continued fora time and then it left him. He said, "Where is the man who just asked about'umra?" The man was brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and he said, 'Regarding the scent which you put on, wash it offthree times. As for the cloak, remove it. Do the same for 'umra as you dofor hajj.'"<P><P><B><BIG>III: The Collection of the Qur'an</BIG></B><P>4702. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "After the slaughter of peoplein the Battle of Yamama, Abu Bakr sent for me. 'Umar was with him. Abu Bakrsaid, ''Umar came to me and said, "Many Qur'an reciters were killed in theBattle of Yamama, and I fear that heavy casualties will be inflicted on theQur'an reciters in other places and therefore much of the Qur'an will belost. I think that you should collect the Qur'an together."' Abu Bakr said,'I said to 'Umar, "How can I do something which the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, did not do?" 'Umar said, "By Allah,it is better." 'Umar kept at me about it until Allah opened my breast tothat. I think what 'Umar thinks about that.'"<P>Zayd continued, "Abu Bakr said, 'You are an intelligent young man and wehave no suspicion about you. You used to write down the revelation for theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Therefore youare to search out the Qur'an and collect it.' By Allah, if he had obligedme to move one of the mountains, that would not have been weightier for methan what he commanded to do of collecting the Qur'an. I said, 'How can youdo something which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, did not do?' Abu Bakr said, 'By Allah, it is better.' Abu Bakrcontinued to keep at me until Allah opened my breast to what Allah had openedthe breasts of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. So I began to search out the Qur'an andcollect it from the palm stalks, thin white stones, and the breasts of menuntil I found end of <I>Surat at-Tawba</I> with Khuzayma al-Ansari whichI did not find with anyone else: <I>'A Messenger has come to you from amongyourselves. Your suffering is distressful to him...' </I>(9:128)" The copyof the Qur'an in which the Qur'an was collected remained in the possessionof Abu Bakr until Allah took him, and then it was with 'Umar until Allahtook him, and then it was with Hafsa bint 'Umar."<P>4703. Anas ibn Malik reported that Hudhayfa ibn al-Yaman came to 'Uthmanwhile the people of Syria were conquering Armenia and Azerbaijan with thepeople of Iraq. Hudhayfa was alarmed by the difference in their recitation.Hudhayfa said to 'Uthman, "Amir al-Mu'minin! Deliver this Community beforethey disagree about the Book as the Jews and Christians differed!" So 'Uthmansent a message to Hafsa, saying, "Send us the pages in your possession andwe will copy them and then return them to you." So Hafsa sent them to 'Uthman.He ordered Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, Sa'id ibn al-'As, and'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham to transcribe copies. 'Uthman saidto the group of the three Qurashis, "When you and Zayd ibn Thabit disagreeabout any of the Qur'an, write it in the dialect of Quraysh. It was revealedin their language." They did that. When they had copied it out, 'Uthman returnedthe pages to Hafsa and he sent a copy of what they had copied out to everyregion and commanded that every sheet or copy which had any other form ofthe Qur'an should be burned.<P>Kharija ibn Zayd ibn Thabit added that he heard Zayd ibn Thabit say, "I missedone ayat of <I>Surat al-Ahzab </I>when we copied out the Qur'an which I usedto hear the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,recite. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzayma ibn Thabit al-Ansari:<I>"Among the believers there are men who have been true to the contractthey made with Allah." </I>(33:23)<P><P><B><BIG>IV: The scribe of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace</BIG></B><P>4703. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "Abu Bakr sent for me andsaid, 'You used to write down the revelation for the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Therefore you are to search outthe Qur'an and collect it.' So I searched it out until I found the last twoayats of<I> Surat at-Tawba</I> with Abu Khuzayma al-Ansari and I did notfind them with anyone else: '<I>A Messenger has come to you from amongyourselves. Your suffering is distressful to him, he is deeply concernedfor you...' </I>(9:128)"<P>4704. It is related that al-Bara' said, "When it was revealed, <I>'Thosebelievers who stay behind are not the same as those who do jihad in the wayof Allah' </I>(4:95), the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Summon Zayd. He should bring the tablet, inkpot and shoulder-blade(or the shoulder-blade and the ink-pot).' Then he said, 'Write: '<I>Thosebelievers who stay behind are not the same </I>...' 'Amr ibn Umm Maktum,the blind man, was behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and he said, 'Messenger of Allah, what do you command me? I am a blindman.' Then in place of it was revealed: <I>'Those believers who stay behind&#150; other than those forced by necessity &#150; are not the same as thosewho do jihad in the way of Allah.'</I>"<P><P><B><BIG>V: The Qur'an was revealed in seven modes(<I>ahruf</I>)</BIG></B><P>4705. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Jibril recited to me in onemode. Then I asked him to repeat it and I continue to ask him for more, andhe finally recited it in seven modes."<P>4706. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab was heard to say, "I heardHisham ibn Hakim reciting <I>Surat al-Furqan</I> while the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was alive. I listened to his recitation andhe was reciting it in various modes which the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, had not recited. I almost grabbed him in theprayer, but I waited until he said the <I>salam</I> [to end the prayer].Then I grabbed by his cloak and demanded, 'Who recited to you this<I>sura</I> which I heard you reciting?' He answered, 'The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited it to me.' I said, 'Youlied! The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recitedit to me differently to how you recited!' So I led him off to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I heard thisone reciting <I>Surat al-Furqan</I> in a different way to how you recitedit to me!' The Messenger of Allah , may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Release him. Recite, Hisham.' So he recited it to him in the way whichI had heard him reciting.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'That is how it was revealed.' Then he said, 'Recite,'Umar,' and I recited it in the recitation he had taught me. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, &nbsp;'That is howit was revealed. This Qur'an was revealed in seven modes, so recite whateveryou find easy of it.'"<P><P><B><BIG>VI: The arrangement of the Qur'an</BIG></B><P>4707. It is related that Yusuf ibn Mahik said, "I was with 'A'isha, the Ummal-Mu'minin, when an Iraqi came and said, 'What kind of shroud is best?'She said, 'Bother you! How will it harm you?' He said, 'Umm al-Mu'minin,show me your copy of the Qur'an.' 'Why?' she asked. He said, 'In order thatI might arrange the Qur'an according to it. It is recited out of its properorder.' 'A'isha said, 'What harm will there be to you whichever part youread first? The first to be revealed was a sura of the <I>Mufassal</I> inwhich the Garden and the Fire is mentioned.* When many people joined Islam,then the <I>halal</I> and <I>haram</I> were revealed. If the first thingto be revealed had been, 'Do not drink wine,' people would have said, 'Wewill never give up wine.' If it had been revealed. 'Do not fornicate,' theywould have said, 'We will never give up fornication.' When I was still ayoung girl who played, it was revealed to Muhammad, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, in Makka, <I>"In fact the Hour is their promised appointmentand the Hour is more disastrous and bitter!"</I> (54:46) <I>Surat al-Baqara</I>(2) and <I>Surat an-Nisa' </I>(4) were revealed while I was with him.' Thenshe produced the copy of the Qur'an for him and dictated to him the orderof the suras."<P>[*i.e. <I>Surat al-'Alaq </I>(96) or <I>Surat al-Mudadaththir</I> (74). The<I>Mufassal</I> begin with <I>Surat Qaf</I> (50), although other things aresaid.]<P>4708. It is said that Ibn Mas'ud was heard to say, "The suras <I>Banu Isra'il,al-Kahf, Maryam, Taha </I>and <I>al-Anbiya' </I>were among the first thatI learned and they are part of the earliest Qur'an that I learned."<P>4709. It is related that al-Bara' said, "I learned <I>'Glorify the Name ofyour Lord, the Most High' </I>(87) before the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, came [to Madina]."<P>4710. It is related that Shaqiq said, "'Abdullah said, 'I learned the<I>Naza'ir </I>which the Prophet. may Allah bless him and grant him peace,used to recite in pairs in each rak'at.' Then 'Abdullah got up and 'Alqamawent in with him. When 'Alqama came out, we questioned him and he said, 'They&nbsp;[the <I>Naza'ir</I>]&nbsp;are twenty suras from the beginning of the<I>Mufassal</I>, according to the order of Ibn Mas'ud, and they end withthe suras starting with <I>HaMim</I>: "HaMim the Smoke" (44) and <I>"Aboutwhat are they asking one another?"</I> (78:1)'"<P><P><B><BIG>VII: Jibril used to review the Qur'an with the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace</BIG></B><P>It is reported from 'A'isha that Fatima, peace be upon her, said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, confided to me, 'Jibril used toreview the Qur'an with me every year, but this year he reviewed it with metwice. I only think that my time is approaching.'"<P>4711. Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous during themonth of Ramadan because Jibril used to met him every night in the monthof Ramadan until it ended. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, used to review the Qur'an with him. When Jibril met him,he was more generous with good than the blowing wind."<P>4712. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "He (Jibril) used to review therecitation of the Qur'an with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, once a year. He reviewed it twice in the year in which he died.The Prophet used to do<I> i'tikaf</I> for ten days every year. The year inwhich he died he did <I>i'tikaf </I>for twenty days."<P><P><B><BIG>VIII: The reciters among the Companions of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace</BIG></B><P>4713. It is related that Masruq said, "'Abdullah ibn 'Amr mentioned 'Abdullahibn Mas'ud and said, "I continue to love him. I heard the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Take the Qur'an from fourpersons: 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, Salim, Mu'adh ibn Jabal and Ubayy ibn Ka'b.'"<P>4714. It is related that Shaqiq ibn Salama said, "'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud delivereda speech to us and said, 'By Allah, I learned about seventy suras directlyfrom the mouth of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace. By Allah, the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, know that I am the one among them with the most knowledge of theBook of Allah, but I am not the best of them."<P>Shaqiq said, "I sat in his circle and I did not hear anyone rejecting whathe said about that."<P>4715. It is related that 'Alqama said, "While we were in the city of Homs,Ibn Mas'ud recited <I>Surat Yusuf</I> (12). A man said, 'That is not howit was revealed.' He said, 'I recited it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and he said, "You did well." He noticed thesmell of wine from the man and said to him, 'Will you both lie about theBook of Allah and drink wine?' He had the <I>hadd</I> punishment carriedout on him [for drinking wine]."<P>4716. It is related from Masruq that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "By Allah.There is no god but Him. There was no sura revealed of the Book of Allahbut that I know where it was revealed, and there is no ayat revealed of theBook of Allah but that I know about what it was revealed. If I had knownthat someone had better knowledge of the Book of Allah than I do, and hewas at a place which could be reached by camel, I would have ridden to him."<P>4717. It is related that Qatada said, "I asked Anas ibn Malik, 'Who knewall the Qur'an in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace?' He replied, 'Four, all of whom were from the Ansar: Ubayy ibnKa'b, Mu'adh ibn Jabal, Zayd ibn Thabit, and Abu Zayd.'"<P>Thumama corroborated it from Anas.<P>4718. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "When the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, only four knew all the Qur'an:Abu'd-Darda', Mu'adh ibn Jabal, Zayd ibn Thabit, and Abu Zayd." He added,"We inherited from him (Abu Zayd)."<P>4719. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that 'Umar said, "Ubayy was the one ofus with the best recitation, yet we leave some of the words of Ubayy. Ubayysaid, 'I took it from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and will not leave it for anything.' Allah Almightysays, <I>'Whenever We abrogate an ayat or cause it to be forgotten, We bringone better than it or equal to it.'</I> (2:106)"<P><P><B><BIG>IX: The Excellence of the <I>Fatiha</I> of the Book</BIG></B><P>4720. It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Mu'alla said, "While I was praying,the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called me,but I did not answer. Then I went to him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, Iwas praying.' He said, 'Does not Allah say, <I>"Respond to Allah, and tothe Messenger, when He calls you "</I> (8:24)?' Then he said to me, 'ShallI will teach you the greatest of the suras in the Qur'an before you leavethe mosque?' He took my hand and when we wanted to leave, I said, 'Messengerof Allah, you said, 'I will teach you the greatest of the suras in the Qur'an."'He said, '<I>"Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds."</I> It isthe Seven Mathani and the Immense Qur'an which I was given.'"<P>4727. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "While we were on a journey,and we had made camp, a slavegirl came and said, 'The chief of the tribehas been stung and our men are away. Can any of you treat him [with someincantation]?' A man went with her although we did not know that he any knewincantations (ruqayya). He did that and the man recovered and ordered thatthirty sheep be given to him and he gave us milk. When we returned, we saidto him, 'Were you good in incantation? Did you used to perform incantations?''No,' he replied. 'The only charm I used was the <I>Umm al-Kitab</I>.' Wesaid, 'Do not say anything until we arrive (or until we ask the Prophet ,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.)' When we reached Madina, we mentionedthat to the Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he asked,'How did you know that it is an incantation? Divide and give me a share aswell.'"<P>This is related from Ma'bad ibn Sirin from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri.<P><P><B><BIG>X: The excellence of <I>Surat al-Baqara</I> (2)</BIG></B><P>4722. It is related from Abu Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Whoever recites the two ayats..."<P>It is related from Abu Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "If someone recites the last two ayats of <I>Suratal-Baqara</I> at night, they will be enough for him."<P>4723. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, &nbsp;mayAllah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;put me in charge of guarding the<I>zakat</I> (<I>al-fit</I>r) of Ramadan. Someone came to me and began totake handfuls of food. I grabbed him and said, 'By Allah, I will take youto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!' &#150;and he recounted the hadith. In the end, he said, 'When you go to bed, recitethe Throne Verse. You will have a protector from Allah with you and shaytanwill not come near you until morning.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'He told you the truth even though he is a liar. Thatwas Shaytan.'" (see 2187)<P><P><B><BIG>XI: The Excellence of <I>Surat al-Kahf</I> (18)</BIG></B><P>4724. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "A man recited <I>Suratal-Kahf</I> while a horse was tied with two ropes beside him. A cloud descendedover him and came closer and closer and the horse began to shy away. In themorning he went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and mentioned that to him. He said, 'That is the <I>sakina</I> which descendedfor the Qur'an.'"<P><P><B><BIG>XII: The Excellence of <I>Surat al-Fath</I> (48)</BIG></B><P>4725. It is related that Aslam said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was travelling at night on one of his journeys and'Umar ibn al-Khattab was travelling with him. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab askedhim about something and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, did not answer. Then he asked him again and he did not answer.Then he asked him yet again and he did not answer. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said,"May your mother be bereft of you, 'Umar! You have pressed the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, three times and each timehe has not answered you.'" 'Umar said, 'I spurred my camel on and then wentahead of the Muslims, fearing that some Qur'an would be sent down about me.It was not long before I heard someone shouting for me." I said, 'I was afraidthat some Qur'an might be sent down about me! I went to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and greeted him and he said,'Tonight a sura has been sent down on me which I love more than that on whichthe sun rises. Then he recited, <I>"Truly We have granted you a manifestvictory."</I> (48:1)'"<P><P><B><BIG>XIII: The excellence of<I> "Say: He is Allah, Absolute Oneness"</I>(112)</BIG></B><P>The <I>isnad</I> contains 'Amra from 'A'isha from the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace ...<P><A NAME="4726">4726</A>. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that a manheard another man reciting, <I>"Say: He is Allah, Absolute Oneness," </I>(112)and repeating it. In the morning, he went to the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned that to him. It seemedthat the man thought it was insufficient. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "By the One who has my soul in his hand,it is equal to a third of the Qur'an!"<P>Abu Sa'id al-Khudri added, "My brother, Qatada ibn an-Nu'man told me thatin the time of the Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a manstood in the night prayer and recited before dawn, the sura which begins<I>"Say: He is Allah, Absolute Oneness" </I>and nothing more. In the morning,a man went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace ...<P>4727. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said to his Companions, "Does any of you findit impossible to recite a third of the Qur'an in a night?" That was hardon them and they asked, "Who among us is able to do that, Messenger of Allah?"He said, " The sura which begins <I>'Say: He is Allah, Absolute Oneness'</I>(112) is a third of the Qur'an."<P>It is related <I>mursal</I> from Ibrahim, and with an <I>isnad</I> from ad-Dahhakal-Mashriqi.<P><P><B><BIG>XIV: The excellence of the <I>Refuge Suras</I> (113 and114)</BIG></B><P>4728. It is related from 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was ill, he would recite the Refuge<I>suras</I> over himself and then blow without spit. When his pain was intense,I used to recite it over him and rub his hand, seeking its blessing."<P>4729. It is related that&nbsp;'A'isha said, "When the Prophet, &nbsp;mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, went to bed every night, he cupped hishands and blow blew on them and recited, the suras which begin <I>'Say: Heis Allah, Absolute Oneness' </I>&nbsp;(112), <I>'Say: I seek refuge withthe Lord of Dawn' </I>(113), and <I>'Say: I seek refuge with the Lord ofpeople' </I>(114). Then he would wipe his hands over as much of his bodyas he could, beginning with head, face and the front of his body. He didthat three times."<P><P><B><BIG>XV: The descent of the Sakina and the angels when the Qur'an isrecited</BIG></B><P>4730. It is reported that Usayd ibn Hudayr said that while he was reciting<I>Surat al-Baqara</I> in the night with his horse tethered beside him, thehorse became agitated. When he was silent, the horse quieted. Then he recitedand the horse became agitated again. He fell silent and the horse becamequiet. Then he recited again and the horse became agitated, so he stopped.His son Yahya was close to the horse and he feared that the horse might stepon him. When he moved him from the place and looked towards the sky, he couldnot see it. In the morning, he told the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, who said, "Recite, Ibn Hudayr! Recite, Ibn Hudayr!" He said,"Messenger of Allah, I was afraid that it would tread on Yahya since he wasclose to it. I lifted my head and went to him. Then I looked up to the skyand there was something like a cloud containing lamps. I went out so thatI would not see it." He asked, "Do you know what that was?" "No," he answered.He said, "Those were the angels who had come near to your voice. If you havecontinued reciting, the people would have seen it in the morning as it wouldnot have been concealed from them."<P>'Abdullah ibn Khabbab also has this hadith from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri fromUsayd ibn Hudayr.<P><P><B><BIG>XVI: &nbsp;The one who said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, did not leave anything except what is between these twocovers."</BIG></B><P>4731. It is related that 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn Rufay' said, "I and Shaddad ibnMa'qil visited Ibn 'Abbas. Shaddad ibn Ma'qil asked, 'Did the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, leave anything [meaning other than theQur'an]?'

He said, 'We visited Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya and askedhim [the same question] and he replied, 'He only left what was between thesetwo covers.'"<P><P><B><BIG>XVII: The excellence of the Qur'an above all other words</BIG></B><P>4732. It is reported from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The metaphor of a believer who recitesthe Qur'an is that of a citron - its scent is fragrant and its taste is good.That of someone who does not recite the Qur'an is that of a date - it hasno scent but its taste is sweet. The metaphor of someone impious who recitesthe Qur'an is that of basil - its scent is fragrant but its taste is bitter.The metaphor of someone impious who does not recite the Qur'an is that ofcolocynth - its taste is bitter and it has no scent."<P>4733. It is related that Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Our time as compared to the communities beforeyou is like the time between the <I>'Asr</I> prayer and sunset. Your metaphorand that of the Jews and the Christians is like a man who hires some workers.He says to them, 'Who will work for me until the middle of the day for aqirat?' The Jews did. Then he says, 'Who will work for me from the middleof the day until <I>'Asr</I>?' The Christians worked. Then you worked from<I>'Asr </I>until <I>Maghrib</I> for two qirats each. They said, 'We didmore work but had a smaller payment!' He asked, 'Have I wronged you all inthat to which you are entitled?' 'No,' they answered. He said, 'That is Myfavour which I give to whomever I wish.""<P><P><B><BIG>XVIII: The command to hold to the Book of Allah Almighty</BIG></B><P>4734. It is related that Talha said, "I asked 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa, 'Didthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, make a will?' He replied,'No.' I asked, 'Then how was the will prescribed for people? Were they commandedto do it when he did not make a will?' He replied, 'He bequeathed the Bookof Allah.'"<P><P><B><BIG>XIX: "The one who did not intone</BIG></B>*<B><BIG> the Qur'an ina good voice"</BIG></B><P>And the words of Allah, <I>"Is it not enough for them that We have sent downto you the Book which is recited to them?</I>" (29:51)<P>4735. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, ""Allah does not listen to anythingso gladly as He listens to a Prophet with a good voice intoning the Qur'analoud."<P>His companion ('Abdu'l-Hamid) said, "He meant reciting it aloud."<P>4736. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Allah does not listen to anything so gladly asHe listens to a Prophet with a good voice intoning the Qur'an aloud."<P>Sufyan said that it means that he is sufficed by it so that he has no needof anything else.<P>[* "Intone (<I>yataghanna</I>)" is literally "sing", in the hadith "The onewho does not intone the Qur'an in a good voice is not one of us," meaning"the one who does not make his voice good with the Qur'an is not one of us."]<P><P><B><BIG>XX: Envying someone who knows the Qur'an</BIG></B><P>4737. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, '"You can only haveenvy for two things: for a man to whom Allah has given the Book of Allah*and he gets up and recites it throughout the night, and for a man to whomAllah has given wealth and he spends it throughout the night and the day.'"<P>4738. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "You can only have envy for two things:a man whom Allah has taught the Qur'an and he recites it throughout the nightand throughout the day. His neighbour hears him and says, 'Would that I hadbeen given the like of what so-and-so has been given so that I could do thelike of what he does!' And there is a man to whom Allah has given wealthand he spends it properly and so another man says, 'Would that I had beengiven the like of what so-and-so has been given so that I could do the likeof what he does!'"<P>[* Meaning memorisation and understanding of the Qur'an.]<P><P><B><BIG>XXI: "The best of you is the one who learns the Qur'an and teachesit."</BIG></B><P>4739. It is related from 'Uthman that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "The best of you is the one who learns the Qur'anand teaches it."<P>He said, "Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman had the best recitation in the amirate of 'Uthmanuntil the arrival al-Hajjaj." He said, "That is what put me into this positionwhere I am."<P>4740. It is related from 'Uthman ibn 'Affan that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "The most excellent of you is the one wholearns the Qur'an and teaches it."<P>4741. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "A woman came to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and stated, 'I have given myselfto Allah and His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' Hesaid, 'I am not in need of women.' A man said, 'Marry her to me.' He said,'Give her a garment.' He said, 'I do not have the wherewithal.' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Give her something, evenif it is only an iron ring.' The man claimed that he had nothing. He said,'What do you know of the Qur'an?' He replied, 'Such-and-such.' He said, 'Ihave married her to you for that amount of the Qur'an which you know.'"<P><P><B><BIG>XXII: Reciting the Qur'an by heart</BIG></B><P>4742. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd that a woman came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Messenger ofAllah, I have come to give myself to you (to dispose of in marriage)." Heraised his eyes to her and looked &nbsp;at her and then lowered his head.When the woman saw that he had not made any decision about her, she sat down.One of his Companions stood up and said, "Messenger of Allah, if you haveno need of her, then marry her to me." He asked, "Do you have anything [togive her]?" He said, "By Allah, no, Messenger of Allah." He said, "Go toyour family and see if you can find something." The man went and returnedand said, "No, Messenger of Allah, I did not find anything." He said, "Look,even if it is an iron ring." He went and then came back and said, "By Allah,Messenger of Allah, no. I did not even find an iron ring, but I have thiswaist-wrapper." Sahl said, "He did not have a cloak and so she could havehalf do it." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "What will see do with your waist-wrapper? If you wear it, she willhave none of it, and if she wears it, you will have none of it." The mansat down for a long time and then got up. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, saw him going away and commanded someone tocall him. When he came back, he asked, "What do you know of the Qur'an?"He replied, "I know this sura, that sura, and that sura," and he named them.He asked, "Do you recite that by heart?" "Yes," he replied. He said, "Go,I have married you to her for what you know of the Qur'an [i.e. to teachit to her]."<P><P><B><BIG>XXIII: Learning the Qur'an by heart and making a habit of recitingit</BIG></B><P><A NAME="4743">4743</A>. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The metaphor ofsomeone who knows the Qur'an is that of a hobbled camel. If he attends toit, it stays with him. If he lets it go, it wanders away."<P>4744. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "It is very bad that someone says, 'I forgotsuch-and-such ayat.' He has been made to forget. Learn the Qur'an by heart.It slips from the breasts of men quicker than camels slip away."<P>4745. The like is related from Mansur. Bishr corroborated it as did Ibn Jurayj.<P>4746. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "Make a habit of reciting the Qur'an. By the One whohas my soul in His hand, it slips away free quicker than a camel gets loosefrom its hobble."<P><P><B><BIG>XXIV: Reciting while on a riding animal</BIG></B><P>4747. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal was heard to say, "I sawthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the daythat Makka was conquered reciting <I>Surat al-Fath</I> while he was on hiscamel."<P><P><B><BIG>XXV: Teaching the Qur'an to children</BIG></B><P>4748. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "That which you call<I>Mufassal</I> is the <I>Muhkam</I>. Ibn 'Abbas said, 'The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died when I was ten yearsold and I had memorised the <I>Mukham</I>.'"<P>4749. It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I learnedthe <I>Muhkam</I> in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace." Sa'id said, ""I asked him, 'What is the<I>Muhkam</I>?' He answered, 'The <I>Mufassal</I>.'"<P>[On this the commentator says that the age of ten may refer to the age atwhich he memorised the Qur'an rather than his age when the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, died.]<P><P><B><BIG>XXVI: Forgetting the Qur'an. Can one say, "I forgot such-and-suchan ayat"?</BIG></B><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "We will cause you to recite so that youdo not forget &#150; except what Allah wills."</I> (87:6-7)<P>4750. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, &nbsp;may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, heard a man reciting in the mosque and said, 'MayAllah have mercy on him. He reminded me of such-and-such an ayat fromsuch-and-such a sura."<P>Hisham added, "I left them out of such-and-such a sura."<P>It is corroborated from Hisham.<P>4751. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, heard a man reciting a sura at night and said, 'MayAllah have mercy on him. He reminded me of such-and-such an ayat which Iforgot from such-and-such a sura.'"<P>4752. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "It is bad for someone to say, 'I forgot such-and-suchan ayat.' Rather he was made to forget."<P><P><B><BIG>XXVII: The one who did see any harm in saying, <I>"Surat al-Baqara"</I>or <I>"Surat such-and-such"</I></BIG></B><P>4753. It is related from Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone recites the last two ayatsof <I>Surat al-Baqara</I>, they will be enough for him for that night."<P>4754. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "I heard Hisham ibn Hakimibn Hizam reciting <I>Surat al-Furqan while</I> the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, was alive. I listened to his recitation and he wasreciting it in various modes which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, had not recited. I almost grabbed him in the prayer,but I waited until he said the salam. Then I grabbed by his cloak and demanded,'Who recited to you this sura which I heard you reciting?' He answered, 'TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited it tome.' I said, 'You lied! The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, recited it to me differently to how you recited!' So I led himoff to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andsaid, 'I heard this one reciting <I>Surat al-Furqan</I> in a different wayto how you recited it to me!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'Release him. Recite, Hisham.' So he recited itto him in the way which I had heard him reciting.' The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'That is how it was revealed.'Then he said, 'Recite, 'Umar,' and I recited it in the recitation he hadtaught me. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'That is how it was revealed.' This Qur'an was revealed in seven modes,so recite whatever you find easy of it.'"<P>4755. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet , may Allah bless himand grant him peace, heard a man reciting at night in the mosque and said,'May Allah have mercy on him. He reminded me of such-and-such an ayat whichI missed from such-and-such a sura."<P><P><B><BIG>XXVIII: The slow recitation of Qur'an (<I>tartil</I>)</BIG></B><P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"Recite the Qur'an distinctly" </I>(73:4) andHis words, <I>"We have divided up the Qur'an so you can recite it to mankindat intervals." </I>(17:106)<P><B><BIG>What is disliked of rattling it off as one rattles offpoetry</BIG></B><P>"<I>Yufraqu</I>" (44:4) is to divide. Ibn 'Abbas said that <I>"faraqnahu"</I>(74:4) means "We divided it."<P>4756. It is related that Abu Wa'il said, "We went to 'Abdullah in the morningand a man said, 'Yesterday I recited all the <I>Mufassal</I>.' Ibn Mas'udsaid, 'This is like the rattling off of poetry. We heard the recitation (ofthe Prophet) and I remember the middle length suras which the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, used to recite. They were 18 suras ofthe <I>Mufassal</I> and two suras beginning with <I>Alif-lam-ha'-mim.</I>'"<P>4757. Sa'id ibn Jubayr related that Ibn 'Abbas said about the words of Allahthe Almighty,<I> "Do not move your tongue trying to hasten it" </I>(75:16),"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used toexperience hardship when Jibril descended with the revelation and he usedto move his lips [for committing it into memory instantly]. That was hardon him and was recognised in him. So Allah the Almighty sent down the ayatin the sura which begins, <I>'No! I swear by the Day of Rising!'(</I>75:1),<I> 'Do not move your tongue trying to hasten it. Its collection</I>(to collect it in your breast) <I>and recitation are Our responsibility.So when We recite it, follow its recitation,' (</I>When We reveal it, thenlisten to it.) 'IThen its explanation is also Our responsibility.' (75:19)He said, 'It is up to Us to make it clear on your tongue.' He said, 'WhenJibril came to you, he would listen and when he left, he would recite itas Allah had promised him."<P><P><B><BIG>XXIX: Prolonging sounds in recitation</BIG></B><P>4758.

It is related that Qatada said, "Anas was asked, 'What was the recitationof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, like?' He said.'It was elongated.' Then he recited, <I>'In the Name of Allah, the All-Merciful,Most Merciful,' </I>prolonging <I>'bismi'llah'</I>, prolonging <I>'ar-Rahman'</I>and prolonging <I>'ar-Rahim.'</I>"<P><P><B><BIG>XXX: <I>at-Tarji'</I></BIG></B><I><BIG><B></B></BIG></I><BIG><B>(Quavering while reciting)</B></BIG><P>4760.

So I recited<I> Surat an-Nisa' </I>to him untilI reached this ayat<I>, 'How will it be when We bring a witness from everynation and bring you as a witness against them?'</I> (4:41) He said, 'Thatis enough now,' and I turned to him and his eyes were flowing with tears."<P><P><B><BIG>XXXIV: How much of the Qur'an should be recited</BIG></B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"So recite as much of it as is easy foryou."</I> (73:20)<P>4764. It is related that Ibn Shubruma said, "I looked to see how much ofthe Qur'an is enough for a man, and I did not find a sura with less thanthree ayats. Therefore I said that it is no proper for anyone to recite lessthan three ayats."<P>[Meaning in the prayer]<P>'Alqama mentioned that he met Abu Mas'ud while he was doing tawaf of theHouse and he mentioned what the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, had said: "If someone recites the last two ayats of <I>Suratal-Baqara</I>, they will be enough for him for that night."<P>4765. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "My father married me toa woman of noble lineage. He used to go to her and ask her about her husband.She would say, 'What an excellent man! He has not slept in our bed and hasnot uncovered us when we came to him!' When this went on for a long time,he mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,who said, 'Let me meet him.' I later met with him and he asked, 'How do youfast?' "Every day,' I replied. He asked, 'How long do you take to recitethe entire Qur'an?' I answered, 'I do it every night.' He said, 'Fast threedays every month and recite the entire Qur'an once a month.' I said, 'I amstrong enough to do more than that.' He said, 'Then fast three days a week.'I said, 'I am strong enough to do more than that.' He said, 'Then fast thebest fast: the fast of Dawud. Fast one day and break the fast the next, anddo a full recitation once a week.' Would that I had accepted the allowanceof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace!' Thatwas when he was old and weak. He used to recite a seventh of the Qur'an tosome of his family in the daytime. He used to read it to check it in thedaytime so that it would be easier for him in the night. When we wanted togain some strength, he would not fast some days and then fast days to makethem up, since he disliked abandoning anything he was doing before the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died.<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that one of them said "over three days," "over five days",but most of them say "seven".<P>4766. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, asked me, 'How long do you take to recitethe entire Qur'an?'"<P>4767.

Abu Musa reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "The believer who recites the Qur'an and acts on it is likea citron - its scent is fragrant and its taste is good.
