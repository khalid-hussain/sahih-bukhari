Book of Expeditions</A></BIG></B><P><P><B>I: The expedition of al-'Ushayra, or 'Usayra</B><P>Ibn Ishaq said, "The first expedition which the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, made was al-Abwa', then Buwat, and then al-'Ushayra."<P>3733. It is related from Abu Ishaq, "Once I was sitting beside Zayd ibn Arqamand he was asked, 'How many expeditions did the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, make?' He answered, 'Nineteen.' He was asked, 'Howmany times did you go on expedition with him?' He said, 'Seventeen.' I said,'Which of them was the first?' He said, 'Al- 'Ushayra, or 'Usayra.' I mentionedit to Qatada who said, 'Al-'Ushayra.'"<P><P><B>II: The Prophet mentioning those who would be killed at Badr</B><P>3734. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "Sa'd ibn Mu'adh wasa friend of Umayya ibn Khalaf. When Umayya passed by Madina, he would staywith Sa'd and when Sa'd passed by Makka, he would stay with Umayya. Whenthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, arrivedin Madina, Sa'd went to do <I>'umra</I> and he stayed with Umayya in Makka.He said to Umayya, 'Look for a time when people have withdrawn so that Ican do <I>tawaf</I>.' He took him out close to midday and Abu Jahl encounteredthem. He said, 'Abu Safwan, who is this <I>with</I> you?' He said, 'Thisis Sa'd.' Abu Jahl said to him, 'Do you think you can do <I>tawaf</I> ofthe Ka'ba in safety when you have given shelter to the heretics and you havestated that you will help and support them? By Allah, were it not that youwere with Abu Safwan, you would not return safe to your family!' Sa'd saidto him, raising his voice, 'By Allah, if you prevent me from this, I willprevent you from something which will be harder for you - travelling throughMadina!' Umayya said to him, 'Sa'd, do not raise your voice to Abu'l-Hakam.He is the master of the people of the valley.' Sa'd said, 'Let me alone,Umayya! By Allah, I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, say that they will kill you!' He asked, 'In Makka?' He replied,'I do not know.' Umayya was very alarmed by that. When he returned to hisfamily, he said, 'Umm Safwan! Do you know what Sa'd said to me?' She asked,'What did he say to you?' He said, 'He claims that he heard Muhammad assertthat they will kill me. I asked him whether it was in Makka and he said,"I do not know."' Umayya said, 'By Allah, I will not leave Makka!'<P>"When it was the Day of Badr Abu Jahl called out the people, 'Go and joinyour caravan!' Umayya did not like to go out, but Abu Jahl came to and said,'Abu Safwan! If the people see that you have stayed behind, and you are oneof the nobles of the people of the valley, they will stay behind.' Abu Jahlkept at him until he said, 'As you have overcome me, by Allah, I will buythe best camel in Makka.' Then Umayya said, 'Umm Safwan, prepare my provisions.'She said to him, 'Abu Safwan, have you forgotten what your Yathribi brothertold you?' He said, 'No, but I only mean to travel a short distance withthem.' When Umayya went out, he used to hobble his camel wherever he campedand he continued to do that until Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, killedhim at Badr."<P><P><B>III: The story of the expedition of Badr</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Allah helped you at Badr when you were weakso show fear of Allah, so that perhaps you will give thanks. And when yousaid to the believers, 'Is it not enough for you that your Lord reinforcedyou with three thousand angels, sent down?' Yes indeed! But if you are steadfastand godfearing and they come upon you suddenly, your Lord will reinforceyou with five thousand angels, clearly identified. Allah only did this forit to be good news for you and so that your hearts might be stilled by it&#150; help comes from no one but Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise &#150;and so that He might cut off a group of those who reject or crush them andthey might be turned back disappointed." </I>(3:123-127)<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that "<I>fawrihim</I>" means their anger.<P>Wahshi said, Hamza killed Tu'ayma ibn 'Adi ibn al-Khiyear on the day of Badr."<P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"When Allah promised you that one of the twoparties would be yours and you would have liked it to have been the unarmedone."</I> (8:7) "<I>Shawka</I>" is iron.<P>3735. It is related that Ka'b ibn Malik said, "I never remained behind theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on any expeditionhe went on other than the Tabuk although I did stay behind the Badr expedition,but no one who stayed behind it was blamed. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, went out making for the caravan of Qurayshbut Allah caused them to meet their enemy without it being planned."<P><P><B>IV: The words of Allah Almighty:</B><P><I>"Remember when you called on your Lord for help and He responded to you:'I will reinforce you with a thousand angels riding in consecutive ranks.'Allah only did this to give you good news and so your hearts would be atpeace. Victory comes from none but Allah. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. WhenHe overcame you with sleep as security from Him and sent down water on youout of heaven to purify you and remove the taint of Shaytan from you, andto fortify your hearts and make your feet firm. When your Lord revealed tothe angels, 'I am with you so make those who believe firm. I will cast terrorinto the hearts of those who reject, so strike their necks and strike alltheir finger joints!' That is because they broke with Allah and His Messenger.If anyone breaks with Allah and His Messenger, Allah is Severe inRetribution."</I> (8:9-13)<P>3736. It is related that Ibn Mas'ud said, "I witnessed something from al-Miqdadibn al-Aswad which I would have rather done than anything thing else equalto it. He came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whilehe was incoking against the idolaters and said, 'We will not say what thepeople of Musa said: <I>"So you and your Lord go and fight."</I> (5:24) Ratherwe will right at your right and your left, before you and behind you.' Isaw the face of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, shiningand it, i.e. what he said, delighted him."<P>3737. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said on the day of Badr, 'O Allah, I ask you by Yourpledge and Your promise! O Allah, if You wish, you will not be worshipped!'Abu Bakr took his hand and said, 'Enough.' He went out, saying, <I>'The assemblywill be routed and turn their backs in flight.' </I>(54:45)"<P>3738. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Those of the believers who stayedbehind [from Badr] are not equal with those who went out to Badr."<P><P><B>V: The number of the people of Badr</B><P>3739. It is related that al-Bara' said, "I and Ibn 'Umar were consideredtoo young."<P>It is related that al-Bara' said, "I and Ibn 'Umar were considered too youngon the day of Badr. There were about sixty Muhajirun in the Battle of Badrand about two hundred and firty Ansar."<P>3740. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The Companions of Muhammad , mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, who were present at Badr related tome that they were the same as the number of the companions of Saul who crossedthe river with him. They were about three hundred and ten. By Allah, onlya believer crossed with him."<P>3741. It is related that al-Bara' said, "We, the Companions of Muhammad,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to relate that the number ofthose who were present at Badr was the number of the companions of Saul whocrossed the river with him, and only a believer crossed with him - aboutthree hundred and ten."<P>3742. It is related that al-Bara' said, "We used to relate the the numberof the people of Badr was about three hundred and ten, the number of thecompanions of Saul who crossed the river with him, and only a believer crossedwith him."<P><P><B>VI: The Prophet invoking against the unbelievers of Quraysh: Shayba, 'Utba,al-Walid and Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, and their destruction</B><P>3743. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, 'The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, faced the Ka'ba and invoked against a groupof Quraysh: against Shayba ibn Rabi'a, 'Utba ibn Rabi'a, al-Walid ibn 'Utba,and Abu Jahl ibn Hisham. By Allah, I bear witness that I saw them fallenand the sun had decomposed them, for it was a hot day."<P><P><B>VII: The slaying of Abu Jahl</B><P>3744. It is related from 'Abdullah that he came upon Abu Jahl when he wasbreathing his last. Abu Jahl said, "Am I anything more extraordinary thana man you have killed?"<P>3745. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said...<P>It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "Who will see what has happened to Abu Jahl?" Ibn Mas'ud wentand found that he had been struck down by the two sons of 'Afra' to the pointof death. He asked, "Are you Abu Jahl?" He took him by his beard and he said,"Am I anything greater than a man you have killed - or whose people havekilled him?"<P>Ahmad ibn Yunus has, "You are Abu Jahl."<P>It is related that Anas &#163; said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'Who will go and see about has happened with Abu Jahl?'So Ibn Mas'ud went and found that he had been struck down by the two sonsof 'Afra' to the point of death. He asked, 'You are Abu Jahl?' He answered,'Am I anything more than a man whose people have killed him - or - whom youhave killed?'"<P>The like of it is related from Anas ibn Malik.<P>3746. It is related from the grandfather of Ibrahim ('Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf)regarding Badr, i.e. the hadith of the two sons of 'Afra'.<P>3747. It is related from Qays ibn 'Ubad that 'Ali ibn Abi Talib &#163; said,"I will be the first to kneel for the All-Merciful on the Day of Rising forthe disputation." Qays ibn 'Ubad said, <I>'Here are two rival groups whodisputed concerning their Lord.' </I>(22:19)" He said, "They were the oneswho came out to fight against each other from the ranks on the day of Badr:Hamza, 'Ali and 'Ubayda or Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Harith, and Shayba ibn Rabi'a,'Utba ibn Rabi'a and al-Walid ibn 'Utba."<P>3748. It is related that Abu Dharr said, "<I>'Here are two rival groups whodisputed concerning their Lord' </I>(22:19) was sent down about six of Quraysh:Hamza, 'Ali and Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Harith, and Shayba ibn Rabi'a, 'Utba ibnRabi'a and al-Walid ibn 'Utba."<P>3749. It is related that 'Ali said, "It is about us that this <I>ayat</I>was sent down: "<I>'Here are two rival groups who disputed concerning theirLord.' </I>(22:19)"<P>3750. It is related from Qays ibn 'Ubad, "I heard Abu Dharr swearing, 'Those<I>ayats</I> were sent down about that group of six people on the day ofBadr."<P>3751. It is related that Qays ibn 'Ubad, "I heard Abu Dharr swearing an oath,that this <I>ayat</I>, <I>'Here are two rival groups who disputed concerningtheir Lord</I>' (22:19) was sent down about those who came forth to fighton the Day of Rising: 'Ali and Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Harith, and Shayba and'Utba, sons of Rabi'a, and al-Walid ibn 'Utba."<P>3752. It is related from Abu Ishaq, "A man asked al-Bara' while I was listening,'Was 'Ali present at Badr?' He replied, 'He went forth from the ranks [forsingle combat] and wore double armour."<P>3753. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf said, "I wrote an agreementwithUmayya ibn Khalaf. On the day of Badr," and he mentioned the killing of himand his son and how Bilal said, "I would rather die than see Umayya saved!"<P>3754. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, recited <I>an-Najm</I> at Makka and did <I>sajda</I>in it and those with him did <I>sajda</I> - except for an old man, who tooka handful of pebbles and brought them up to his forehead and said, 'Thisis enough for me.' I later saw him killed as an unbeliever."<P>3755. It is related that 'Urwa said, "Az-Zubayr had three sword scars: onewas on his shoulder. I used to put my fingers into it." He said, "He receivedtwo wounds in the Batle of Badr and one in the Battle of Yarmuk." 'Urwa said,"'Abdu'l-Malik ibn Marwan said to me when 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr was killed,''Urwa! Do you recognise the sword of az-Zubayr?' I said, 'Yes.' He said,'What marks does it have?' I said, 'It has a dent on its edge which happenedin the Battle of Badr.' He said, 'You spoke the truth. They have dents fromclashing with the regiments.'" Then he returned it to 'Urwa. Hisham said,'We valued it at three thousand. One of us took it, and I only wish thatI could have been the one who took it."<P>It is related that Hisham's father said, "The sword of az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwamhas decorated with silver." Hisham said, "'Urwa's sword was decorated withsilver."<P>3756. It is related that 'Urwa said, "The Companions of the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to az-Zubayr on dayof the Battle of Yarmuk, 'Will you attack and we will attack with you?' Hesaid, 'If I attack, you will fail (to attack).' They said, 'We will not dothat.' So he attacked them until he pierced through their lines and wentbeyond them and no one was with him. Then he turned to return and they grabbedhis rein and struck him two blows on his shoulder between which was the woundhe had received at the Battle of Badr.'" 'Urwa said, "I used to put my fingersin those scars while playing when I was a child." 'Urwa said, "'Abdullahibn az-Zubayr was with him on that day and he was ten years old. He carriedhim on a horse and entrusted him to a man."<P>3757. It is related from Abu Talha that on the day of Badr the Prophet ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had commanded that twenty-fourmen of the leaders of Quraysh be thrown into one of dirty stone wells ofBadr. Whenever he defeated a people, he used to stay in the area for threenights. On the third day of Badr, he commanded that his she-camel be saddledand then went, followed by his Companions. They said, 'We only suppose thathe is going to something of import,' and he stopped at the edge of the welland became to call them by their names and the names of their fathers, 'Oso-amd-so son of so-and-so! O so-amd-so son of so-and-so! Would it have pleasedyou to have obeyed Allah and His Messenger?' We have found what our Lordpromised us to be true? Have you found what your Lord promised you to betrue?'" He said, "'Umar said, 'Messenger of Allah, are you speaking to soullessbodies?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'By the One who has the soul of Muhammad in His hand, you do not hearwhat I say better than they do!'"<P>Qatada said, "Allah brought them to life so that they could hear what hesaid as a rebuke, to belittle them, and for revenge, grief and regret."<P>3758. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said about, <I>"those who have exchangedAllah's blessing for unbelief," </I>(14:28) "They, by Allah, are the unbelieversof Quraysh." 'Amr said, "They are Quraysh and Muhammad, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, is the favour of Allah." About <I>"They have moved theirpeople to the abode of ruin,"</I> he says, "It is the Fire on the Day ofBadr."<P>3759. It is related from Hisham's father, "It was mentioned in the presenceof 'A'isha that Ibn 'Umar traced this to the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, 'The dead person is punished in his grave on accountof the weeping of his family.' She said, 'Ibn 'Umar, may Allah have mercyon him, forgot. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "He is punished for his wrong actions and sins while his familyare weeping over him then."' She said, 'This is like what the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said when he stood over thewell which contained the idolaters slain at Badr and said to them, "Theyhear what I say." He said, "Now they know that what I used to tell them isthe truth."' Then she recited,<I> 'You will not make dead men hear'</I> (30:52)and <I>'You cannot make those in the grave hear.' </I>(35:22) She said, 'Thatis when they take their seats in the Fire.'"<P>3760. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, stood at the well of Badr and said, 'Have you foundwhat your Lord promised you to be true?' Then he said, 'They hear what Iam saying now.' It was mentioned to 'A'isha and she said, 'The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Now they know that what I usedto tell them is the truth."' Then she recited the ayat, '<I>You will notmake dead men hear</I>.' (30:52)"<P><P><B>VIII: The excellence of those who were present at Badr</B><P>3761. It is related from Anas that Haritha was killed at Badr while stilla lad. His mother came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and said, "O Messenger of Allah, you know how dear I hold Haritha.If he is in the Garden, I will be patient and expect the reward. If the caseis other than that, you will see what I will do." He said, "Woe to you!,Have you taken leaves of your senses? Is there only one Garden? There aremany gardens within the Garden, and your son has obtained the Highest Paradise."<P>3762. It is related that 'Ali said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, sent me, Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi, and az-Zubayr ibnal-'Awwam on horseback. saying, 'Go until you reach the meadow Khakh. Therewill be a woman of the idolaters bearing a the letter of Hatib ibn Abi Balta'ato the idolaters ' We reached her on her camel where the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said. We said, 'The letter!'She replied, 'We have no letter.' So we made her camel kneel and searchedwithout seeing any letter. We said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, does not lie. You will bring out the letter or wewill strip you." When she saw we were serious, she put her hand below herwaist-belt and produced it. We took it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace. 'Umar said, 'O Messenger of Allah, he hasbetrayed Allah, His Messenger and the believers. Let me strike off his head!'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'What moved youto do this?' Hatim said, 'By Allah, I only believe in Allah and His Messenger!But I wanted to have some favour with them with which Allah might protectmy relatives and property. There are none of your Companions who do not haverelatives by whom Allah will protect their family and property.' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'He has told the truth. Donot say anything but good about him.' 'Umar said, 'O Messenger of Allah,he has betrayed Allah, His Messenger and the believers. Let me strike offhis head!' He said, 'Was he not one of the people of Badr? Perhaps Allahlooked down on the people of Badr and said, "Do what you like. The Gardenis mandatory for you " or "I have forgiven you."' 'Umar wept and said, 'Allahand His Messenger know best.'"<P>3763. It is related that Abu Usayd said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said to us on the Day of Badr, 'When theydraw near you, then you must shoot, but try to make your arrows last.'"<P>It is related that Abu Usayd said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, told us on the Day of Badr, 'When they draw nearyou (i.e. overwhelm you with superior numbers), then you must shoot, buttry to make your arrows last.'"<P>3764. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib was heard to say, "On the Dayof Uhud, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,put 'Abdullah ibn Jubayr in charge of the archers. Seventy of us were struckdown. On the day of Badr, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and his Companions had struck down one hundred and forty of the idolaters- seventy were captured and seventy were killed. Abu Sufyan said, 'A daywhich is in return for the day of Badr. Victory in war goes in turns.'"<P>3765. It is related from Abu Musa - I think - that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "The good is that which Allah broughtlater, and the reward of truthfulness is what Allah gave us after the Dayof Badr."<P>3766. It is related that 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf said, "While I was standingin the ranks on the day of Badr, I looked to my right and my left, and therewere two young boys of the Ansar, and I did not feel safe between them. Oneof them whispered so that his companion would not hear, 'Uncle, show me AbuJahl.' I asked, 'What do you want of him, nephew?' He said, 'I have vowedthat if I see him, I will kill him or die in the attempt.' Then the othersaid the like of it to me." He said, 'It would not have made me happy tobe between two men in place of them. I pointed him out to them and they swoopedon him like two falcons until they struck him down. They were the sons of'Afra'."<P>3767. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent out ten spies and put 'Asim ibn Thabital-Ansari, the grandfather of 'Asim ibn 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, in commandof them. They proceeded until they reached Had'a, which is between 'Usfanand Makka. Their presence was reported to a branch of Hudhayl called theBanu Lihyan. About a hundred men, who were all archers, set out after them.They followed their tracks until they found where they had eaten dates whichthey had taken as provision from Madina. They said, 'These are the datesof Yathrib,' and they followed their tracks.<P>"When 'Asim and his companions perceived them, they took cover. The peoplesurrounded them and said to them, 'Come down and give yourselves up! Youhave protection and assurance that we will not kill any of you!' 'Asim ibnThabit said, 'O people! As for me, I will not come down into the protectionof an unbeliever! O Allah, inform Your Prophet about us!' They shot at themwith arrows and killed 'Asim. A group of three came down, accepting the offerof protection and security. They included Khubayb al-Ansari, Zayd ibn Dathina,and another man. When they had them in their power, they undid their bow-stringsand tied them up. Then the third man said, 'This is the beginning of treachery!By Allah, I will not accompany you! There is a good example in these!' i.e.those who had been killed. They dragged him and tried to persuade him toaccompany them but he refused. They took Khubayb and Zayd ibn Dathina andsold them after the Battle of Badr.<P>"The sons of al-Harith ibn 'Amir ibn Nawfal bought Khubayb. Khubayb was theman who had killed al-Harith in the Battle of Badr. So Khubayb remained aprisoner with them until they agreed to kill him.<P>"He asked to borrow a razor from one of the daughters of al-Harith with whichto shave his private parts and she lent it to him. A son of hers went rightup to him when she was not paying attention. She found him sitting on hisknee and the razor was in his hand. She said, "I was so alarmed that Khubaybnoticed it and said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? I would neverdo that.' She said, 'By Allah, I never saw a better prisoner than Khyubayb.By Allah, one day I found him eating from a bunch of grapes he had in hishand, when he was shackled in irons and there was no fruit in Makka.' Sheused to say, 'It was provision from Allah which He gave to Khubayb.' Whenthey brought him out of the Haram to kill him in profane land, Khubayb saidto them, 'Let me pray two <I>rak'ats</I>.' They let him pray two<I>rak'ats</I>. Then he said, 'By Allah, were it not that you might think thatI was afraid, I would have made them longer. O Allah, reckon them one byone, every one of them and kill them one by one and do not spare any of them!'He then said:<BLOCKQUOTE>  'I do not care what manner death I die  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if I am slain as a Muslim!  <P>  That is for the sake of Allah, and if He wills,  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He can bless the joints of a torn limb!'</BLOCKQUOTE><P>"Then Abu Sarwa'a 'Uqba ibn al-Harith went to him and killed him. So it wasKhubayb who made the sunna for every Muslim man who is killed in detentionto pray two<I> rak'ats</I>. He, i.e. the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, informed his Companions about them on the day they fell.When they were informed that 'Asim ibn Thabit had been killed, some of peopleof Quraysh sent some people to bring part of him that could be recognised.He had killed one of their great men on the Day of Badr. Allah sent over'Asim a swarm of bees like a cloud and it protected him from their messengersand they could not cut off any part of him."<P>3768. Ka'b ibn Malik said, "They mentioned Murara ibn ar-Rabi' al-'Amri andHilal ibn Umayya al-Waqifi who were two righteous men who had been presentat Badr."<P>3769. It is related from Nafi' that it was mentioned to Ibn 'Umar that Sa'idibn 'Amr ibn Nufayl, one who had been at Badr, had become ill on a Friday.He rode to visit him well into midmorning when <I>Jumu'a </I>was near, andhe abandoned <I>Jumu'a</I>.<P>3770. It is related that 'Umar ibn 'Abdullah ibn al-Arqam az-Zuhri visitedSubay'a bint al-Harith al-Aslamiyya to ask her about her <I>hadith</I> andabout what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said to her when she asked him for her decision [about <I>'idda</I>]. 'Umaribn 'Abdullah ibn al-Arqam az-Zuhri then wrote to 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba toinform him that Subay'a bint al-Harith had informed him that she had beenmarried to Sa'd ibn Khawla, who was one of the Banu 'Amir ibn Lu'ayy, Hewas one of those who had been present at Badr. He died, leaving her a widow,in the Farewell Pilgrimage while she was pregnant. It was not long afterhis death when she gave birth. When she was pure, she adorned herself forsuitors. Abu's-Sanabil ibn Ya'kak, a man from the Banu'd-Dar, visited herand said to her, 'Why do I see you adorned for suitors and hoping for marriage.By Allah, you will not marry until you have completed four months and tendays!' Subay'a said, 'When he said that to me, I got dressed in the eveningand went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and asked him about that. He gave me a judgement that I had become lawfulwhen I gave birth and told me to marry if I wished.'"<P>It is related from Muhammad ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Thawban, the client ofthe Banu 'Amir ibn Lu'ayy, that his father, Muhammad ibn Iyas ibn al-Bukayr,who had been at Badr, informed him..."<P><P><B>IX: The angels being present at Badr</B><P>3771. It is related that Rifa'a ibn Rafi' az-Zuraqi, who had been at Badr,said, "Jibril came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and said, 'How do you gauge the people of Badr among you?' He replied, 'Amongthe best of the Muslims,' or words to that effect. He said, 'It is the samewith those of the angels who were present at Badr.'"<P>3772. It is related that Mu'adh ibn Rifa'a ibn Rafi' said, "Rifa'a was oneof the people of Badr and Rafi' was one of the people of 'Aqaba. He usedto say to his son, 'It would not make me happy to exchange being presentat Badr for 'Aqaba.' He said that Jibril asked the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, this."<P>It is related from Mu'adh ibn Rifa'a that an angel asked the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace,the like of it.<P>Yahya reported that he was with Yazid ibn al-Hadi on the day that Mu'adhreported this <I>hadith</I> to him and that Mu'adh said that the one whoasked was Jibril, peace be upon him.<P>3773. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said on the Day of Badr, "This is Jibril, holding hishorse's head which is decked out for war."<P>3774. It is related that Anas said, "Abu Zayd died and did not leave anyoffspring, and he had been at Badr."<P><A HREF="muw8.html#s8">3775</A>. It is related from Ibn Khabbab that AbuSa'id ibn Malik al-Khudri came from a journey and his family offered himsome meat from the sacrifices of 'Id al-Adha. He said. 'I will not eat ituntil I ask about it. So he went to his maternal brother, Qatada ibn an-Nu'man,who had been at Badr, and asked him and he said, 'After you an order wasgiven annulling what they were forbidden regarding eating the meat of thesacrifices after three days."<P>3776. It is related that 'Urwa said that az-Zuabyr said, "On the Day of BadrI met 'Ubayda ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As who was covered in armour so that onlyhis eyes were visible. His <I>kunya</I> was Abu Dhat al-Karsh. He said, 'Iam Abu Dhat al-Karsh!' I attacked him with my spear and stabbed him in hiseye and he died.'" Hisham (ibn 'Urwa) said, "I was told that az-Zubayr said,'I put my foot on him and then pulled and it required effort to remove itas both its ends were bent." 'Urwa said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, asked him for it and he gave it to him. Whenthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, hetook it. Then Abu Bakr asked for it and he gave it to him. When Abu Bakrdied, 'Umar asked him for it and he gave it to him, When 'Umar died, he tookit and then 'Uthman asked him for it and he gave it to him. When 'Uthmanwas murdered, it remained with the family of 'Ali. 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayrasked for it and it remained with him until he was killed.<P>3777. It is related from 'A'idhu'llah ibn 'Abdullah that that 'Ubada ibnas-Samit, who had been present at Badr, said that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Give me allegiance."<P>3778.

Salim was the client of awoman of the Ansar. This was as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, had adopted Zayd. In the <I>Jahiliyya</I>, when a manadopted someone as his son, the people would call him by his adoptive father'sname and he would inherit from him, until Allah Almighty sent down, <I>'Callthem after their fathers.' </I>(33:5) Sahla went to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace,'" and the hadith is mentioned. (see 4800)<P>3779. It is related that ar-Rubayyi' bint Mu'awwidh said, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, visited me the morning after my marriageand sat on my bed as you are sitting know. The girls were beating tambourinesand chanting eulogies about their fathers on the Day of Badr. Then one girlsaid, 'There is a Prophet among us who knows what will happen tomorrow.'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not say that.Say what you were saying before.'"<P>It is related from az-Zuhri.<P>3780. It is related that Abu Talha, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who had been present at Badr withthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that hesaid, "Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or the pictureof a living creature." He meant images of things which have souls."<P>3781. It is related that 'Ali said, "I received an old she-camel in my shareof the booty of the Battle of Badr and the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, had also given me one from the <I>khumus</I> taken on thatday. When I wanted to marry Fatima, peace be upon her, the daughter of theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, I arranged witha goldsmith of the Banu Qaynuqa' to travel with me. We brought some<I>idhkhir</I> herb which I intended to sell to the goldsmiths and use theproceeds for my wedding feast. While I was collecting gear for my camelsin saddles, sacks and ropes, I left my two camels were kneeling beside theroom of a man of the Ansar. I returned when I had gathered what I gatheredand found my two camels with their humps cut off, their sides split openand some of their livers taken. I could not control my tears when I saw themin that state and I demanded, 'Who has done this?' They replied, 'Hamza ibn'Abdu'l-Muttalib did it. He is in this room with some of the Ansar who aredrinking, and there is a singing slavegirl and his friends with him. Whileshe was singing, she said," O Hamza, get the fat she-camels!" So Hamza leaptfor his sword and cut off their humps and slit open their sides and tooksome of their livers.'<P>'Ali said, "I wentin to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and Zayd ibn Haritha was with him. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, recognised that something had happened to me and asked, 'Whatis wrong with you?' I answered, 'Messenger of Allah, I have never seen sucha day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels and cut off their humpsand slit open their sides. He is in a house with some drinkers.' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for his cloak and put iton and then set out on foot, and I and Zayd ibn Haritha followed him untilhe reached the house where Hamza was. He asked for permission to enter andwas given permission. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,began to criticise Hamza for what he had done. Hamza was drunk and his eyeswere red. Hamza looked at the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and then he raised his eyes and looked at his knees, and then he raisedhis eyes and looked at his face. Then Hamza said, 'Are you not my father'sslaves?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,saw that he was drunk, and so the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, withdrew, without turning his back, and left, we leftwith him.'"<P>3782. It is related from Ibn Ma'qil that 'Ali led the [funeral]<I>takbirs</I> over Sahl ibn Hunayf and said, "He was present at Badr."<P>3783.

He answered, 'Let me reflecton it.' A few days later he said, 'It seems to me that I should not marryat this time.'" 'Umar said, "Then I met Abu Bakr and said, 'If you wish,I will marry you to Hafsa bint 'Umar.' Abu Bakr was silent and did not giveme any reply at all, and that was more painful to me than 'Uthman's answer.Some days later the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, proposed to her and I married her to him. Abu Bakr met me and said,'Perhaps you were pained by me when you offered me Hafsa and I did not replyto you?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'I was only prevented from replying toyou in your offer by the fact that I knew that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, had mentioned her and I would not divulgethe secret of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.If he had left her, I would have accepted her.'"<P>3784.

Abu Mas'ud 'Uqba ibn 'Amr al-Ansari,the grandfather of Zayd ibn Hasan and one who had been present at Badr, hadgone to him and said, 'Do you not know that Jibril and prayed and the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed the five prayers?Then Jibril said, "I was commanded to do this."'" That is how Bashir ibnAbi Mas'ud related it from his father.<P>3786. It is related that Abu Mas'ud al-Badri said that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The two <I>ayats</I> at theend of <I>Surat al-Baqara</I> protect whoever recites them at night."<P>'Abdu'r-Rahman said, "I met Abu Mas'ud while he was doing <I>tawaf</I> ofthe House and questioned him and he related it to me.'"<P>3787. It is related from Mahmud ibn ar-Rabi' that 'Itban ibn Malik, who wasone of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and one of the Ansar who was present at Badr, came to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>It is related that Ibn Shihab said, "Then I asked al-Husayn ibn Muhammad,one of the sons of Salim and one of their nobles, about the hadith of Mahmudibn ar-Rabi' from Itban ibn Malik, and he confirmed it."<P>3788. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amir ibn Rabi'a, who of the greatmen of the Banu 'Adi, whose father had been present at Badr with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that 'Umar appointed Qudama ibnMaz'un over Bahrayn, and he had also been present at Badr, and was the maternaluncle of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar and Hafsa.<P>3789. It is related that Salim ibn 'Abdullah reported that Rafi' ibn Khadijinformed 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that his paternal uncles, who had been presentat Badr, had reported to him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, forbade renting fields. I [az-Zuhri] said to Salim,"Do you rent them?" He replied, "Yes. Rafi' was too severe on himself."<P>3790. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Shaddad ibn al-Had al-Laythi said," I saw Rifa'a ibn Rafi'a al-Ansari who had been present at Badr."<P>3791. It is related from 'Amr ibn 'Awf al-Ansari, who was an ally of theBanu 'Amir ibn Lu'ayy and who was present with the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, at Badr, that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah to Bahraynto collect their <I>jizya</I>. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, had made a peace treaty with the people of Bahrayn andappointed al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami as their governor. Abu 'Ubayda broughtthe money from Bahrayn and the Ansar heard of the arrival of Abu 'Ubadyawhich coincided with the time of the <I>Fajr</I> prayer with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When he had prayed <I>Fajr</I> withthem and finished, they presented themselves before him and the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, smiled when he saw them.He said, 'I think you must have heard that Abu 'Ubayda has arrived withsomething?' They replied, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Rejoice, andhope for what will gladden you. By Allah, I fear that this world will bespread out in front of you as it was spread out in front of those beforeyou, and then you will vie for it as they vied for it, and it will destroyyou as it destroyed them.'"<P>3792. It is related from Nafi' that In 'Umar used to kill all snakes untilAbu Lubaba al-Badri related to him that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, forbade killing white house snakes, and so he left themalone.<P>3793. It is related from Anas that some men of the Ansar asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for permission and said,"Allow us to forgo the ransom of our nephew 'Abbas."

It is related from 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Adi ibn al-Khiyar reported to himthat al-Miqdad ibn 'Umar al-Kindi, who was an ally of the Banu Zuhra andone of those who had been present at Badr with the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, reported to him that he had said tothe Messenger of Allah, &nbsp;may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Whatdo you think if I meet a man of the unbelievers and we fight and he strikesone of my hands with his sword and cuts it off and then takes refuge fromme behind a tree and says, 'I have surrendered to Allah.' Should I kill him,Messenger of Allah, after he has said that?" The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "No, do not kill him. If you wereto kill him, then he would be in your position before you killed him andyou would be in his position before he said that word which he said."<P>3795. It is related from Anas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said on the Day of Badr, "Who will see what hashappened to Abu Jahl?" Ibn Mas'ud went and found that he had been struckdown by the two sons of 'Afra' to the point of death. He asked, "Are youAbu Jahl?"<P>It is related that Anas said, "You are Abu Jahl." He said, "Is it more thana man whom you have killed - (Sulayman said,) or whose people have killedhim?"<P>Abu Miljaz said that Abu Jahl said, "Would that it had been someone otherthan a farmer that killed me!"<P>3796. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "'Umar said, 'When the Prophet. mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, died, I said to Abu Bakr, "Let us goto our brothers of the Ansar."' Two righteous men of them who had been presentat Badr met them. I related it to 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr and he said, 'Theywere 'Uwaym ibn Sa'ida and Ma'n ibn 'Adi.'"<P>3797.

It is related that Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "When the first civildisturbance took place - i.e. when 'Uthman was murdered - none of those whohad been at Badr was still alive. Then the second civil disturbance tookplace - i.e. the Battle of al-Harra, and none of people of al-Hudaybiyyawere left. Then the third civil disturbance took place and it did not stopuntil the people were without strength."<P>3801. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, Sa'd ibn al-Musayyab, 'Alqamaibn Waqqas and 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah from the hadith of 'A'isha, thewife of the Prophet, and each related part of the <I>hadith</I>, that shesaid, "I went out with Umm Mistah and Umm Mistah tripped on her dress andsaid, 'May Mistah stumble!' I said to her, 'What you have said is bad. Wouldyou curse a man who was present at Badr?'" and the story of the Lie is mentioned.<P>3802. It is related that Ibn Shihab said, "These were the expeditions ofthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace," and hementioned the hadith and said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, addressing them, 'Have you found the promise ofyour Lord to be true?"<P>Nafi' said that 'Abdullah said, "Some of his Companions said, 'O Messengerof Allah, are you calling on dead people?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'You do not hear what I say better thanthey do.'"<P>3803. Abu 'Abdullah said, "The sum total of those who of Quraysh who werepresent at Badr who had a share allotted to them was eighty-one. 'Urwa ubnaz-Zubayr used to said that az-Zubayr said, 'When their shares were divided,they were a hundred.

Chapter: The story of the Banu'n-Nadir and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, going to them regarding the bloodmoney of the two men, and how they meant to betray the Messenger of Allah</B><P>'Urwa said, "This happened at the beginning of the six month after the Battleof Badr and before Uhud."<P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"It is He who expelled those who reject amongthe People of the Book from their homes to the first gathering-place. Youdid not think that they would leave." </I>(59:2)<P>Ibn Ishaq puts it after Bir Ma'una and Uhud.<P>3804. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "Banu'n-Nadr and Qurayza fought,and so he exiled the Banu'n-Nadir and allowed Qurayza to stay, being graciousto them, until Qurayza fought again. Then he killed their men and dividedup their women and children and property between the Muslims, except forsome of them who reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,who gave them security and they became Muslim. He exiled all the Jews ofMadina: the Banu Qaynuqa', who were the tribe of 'Abdullah ibn Salam, theJews of the Banu Haritha and all other Jews of Madina."<P>3805. It is related that Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "I said to Ibn 'Abbas,'<I>Surat al-Hashr</I>,' and he said, 'Say, Surat an-Nadir."'"<P>Hushaym corroborated it from Abu Bishr.<P>3806. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "A man would appointfor the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, come of the palm-treesuntil he conquered Qurayza and an-Nadir. After that, he returned them ([theamounts appointed] to them."<P>3807. it is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, had the palm-trees of the Banu'n-Nadir burnedand cut down at al-Buwayra. Then it was revealed, <I>'Whatever palm-treesyou cut down, or left standing upright on their roots, was done by Allah'spermission ' </I>(59:5)<P>3808. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, burned the date-palms of the Banu'n-Nadir and cut themdown at al-Buwayra. He said that Hassan said about it:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  The leaders of Banu Lu'ayy found it easy  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to watch the fire spreading at al-Buwayra.  <P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>He said that Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith answered him:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  May Allah make that action continue  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and let the blaze burn its neighbourhoods!  <P>  Then you will know which of us is far from it  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and you will know which of our lands will be harmed!</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>3809. It is is related from Malik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadathan an-Nadri that 'Umaribn al-Khattab once summoned him. Then his chamberlain Yarfa' came to himand said, 'Will you admit 'Uthman, 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf, az-Zubayr, andSa'd ibn al-Waqqas who are asking to enter?' He said, 'Yes.' So he admittedthem. Shortly later he then came and said, 'Will you admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?'He said, 'Yes.' When they entered, 'Abbas said, 'Amir al-Mu'minin! Judgebetween me and this one!' They had a disagreement about the spoils whichAllah had given His Messenger from the Banu'n-Nadir. 'Ali and 'Abbas abusedeach other and the group said, 'O Amir al-Mu'minin! Judge between them andrelieve one of the other.' 'Umar said, 'Be patient. I adjure you by Allahby whose permission the heaven and earth subsist, do you know that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "We do not leaveinheritance. What we leave is <I>sadaqa</I>," and that he meant himself?'They answered, 'He said that.' 'Umar turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas, and said,'I adjure you by Allah, do you know that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said that?' They both said, 'Yes.' He said,'I will talk to you about this matter. Allah - Glory be to Him! - singledout His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for these spoilssomething which he did not give anyone else. He - may His mention be exalted!said, <I>"Whatever booty from them Allah has given to His Messenger &#150;and you spurred on neither horse nor camel in its acquisition" </I>to Hiswords, <I>"Allah has power over all things.</I>" (59:6) This was speciallyfor the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. By Allah,he did not appropriate it to your exclusion, and he did not prefer himselfwith it against you. He gave it to you and distributed it among you untilthis property remained of it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, used to spent on his family the maintenance of a yearfrom this property. Then what remained he made the property of Allah. TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did that duringhis lifetime. Then Allah took the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and Abu Bakr said, "I am the successor of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace.' So Abu Bakr took it and acted with it asthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had acted,and you were there.'<P>"Then he turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, 'You both remember that AbuBakr acted in it as you said, and Allah knows best that in it he was truthful,pious, right-guided, following the truth. Then Allah took Abu Bakr and Isaid, "I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and Abu Bakr. I held it under my control for two yearsduring which I acted in it as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and Abu Bakr acted. Allah knows that I was truthful,pious, right-guided, following the truth in it. Then you two came to talkto me, and you both said the same thing and had the same case. 'Abbas, youcame to me, I said to you both that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "We do not leave inheritance. What we leaveis <I>sadaqa</I>," Then I thought it best to hand it over to you and I said,"If you wish, I will hand it over to you on the basis that you take the pledgeand pact of Allah to act in it as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, acted in it and as Abu Bakr acted in it and as Iacted in it since I took charge. Otherwise, do not speak to me about it,"and you both said, "Hand it over to us on that basis," and I handed it overto you. So are you now seeking from me a decision other than that? By Allahby whose permission the heaven and earth subsist, I would not give a decisionin it other than that until the Last Hour comes! If you are incapable ofit, then give it to me and I will spare you of it.'"<P>He [az-Zuhri] said, "I related this hadith to 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr and hesaid, 'Malik ibn Aws spoke the truth. I heard 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet,say, "The wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,sent 'Uthman to Abu Bakr to ask him for the eighth of the spoils which Allahgave to His Messenger. I opposed them and said to them, 'Will you not fearAllah? Do you not knoew that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, used to say, "We do not leave inheritance. What we leave is<I>sadaqa</I>," and he meant himself by that. "The family of Muhammad eatfrom this property."' So the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, stopped after what I told them."' He said, 'This<I>sadaqa</I> was in the possession of 'Ali and 'Ali denied it to 'Abbasand overcame him. Then it was in the position of Hasan ibn 'Ali, then Husyanibn 'Ali, then 'Ali ibn Husayn and Hasan ibn Hasan, who managed it in turns.It was truly the sadaqa of the Messenger of Allah*.'"<P>3810. It is related that 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin reported that Fatima andal-'Abbas went to Abu Bakr to ask for their inheritance of his land at Fadakand his share of Khaybar. Abu Bakr said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, say, 'We do not bequeath inheritance. Whatwe leave is <I>sadaqa</I>. The family of Muhammad eat from this property,'By Allah, I would prefer to be good to the relatives of the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, than to be good to my ownrelatives.'"<P><P><B>XII: The killing of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf</B><P>3811. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to say that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Who will deal withKa'b ibn al-Ashraf? He has insulted Allah and His Messenger, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace." Muhammad ibn Maslama stood up and said, "Messengerof Allah, would you like me to kill him?." He replied, "Yes." He said, "Giveme permission to say something." He said, "Say it." So Muhammad ibn Maslamawent to him and said, "This man has asked us for <I>sadaqa</I> and has madeimpositions on us, so I have come to ask you to make me a loan." He said,"By Allah, he will tire you!" He said, "We have followed him and we do notwant to leave him until we see how his business will end up. We want foryou to lend us one or two <I>wasqs</I> [of food]." ['Amr related more thanonce, "He did not mention 'one or two wasqs.'"] He said, "Alright, but youmust leave me a pledge." They said, "What do you want?" He said, "Leave yourwomen with me as a pledge." They said, "How can we leave our women with youas a pledge when you are the most handsome of the Arabs?" He said, "Thenleave your sons with me as a pledge." They said, "How can we leave our sonswith you as a pledge? One of them will be abused and it will said, 'He waspledged for one or two wasqs. This will be a shame for us. Rather we willleave our arms as a pledge with you." Sufyan said it meant weapons. He promisedto come to him and he went to him at night with Abu Na'ila, Ka'b's milk brother.He invited them into the fortress and came down to them. His wife said tohim, "Where are you going at this hour?" He said, "It is only Muhammad ibnMaslama and my brother Abu Na'ila." Someone other than 'Amr said that shesaid, "I hear a voice that seems to have blood dripping from it. He said,"It is only my brother, Muhammad ibn Maslama and my milk brother Abu Na'ila.The generous man should answer, even if he is called to an attack by night."<P>He said, "Muhammad ibn Maslama came in with two men." Sufyan was asked, "Did'Amr name them?" He said that some of them named them. 'Amr said, "He broughttwo men with him," and other than 'Amr said, "Abu 'Abs ibn Jabr, al-Harithibn Aws, and 'Abbad ibn Bishr." But 'Amr said, "He brought two men with himand said, 'When he comes, I will speak pull his hair and smell it. When yousee that I have hold of his head, then you must strike him.'" He said once,"Then I will let you smell it." He came down to them fully clad and the smellof perfume came from him. He said, "I have never smelt a more fragrant scentthan this!" Someone other than 'Amr said that he said, "I have the most skilledof Arab women in scent and the most perfect of the Arabs." 'Amr said thathe asked, "Will be give me permission to smell your head?" He said, "Yes."He smelt it and let his companions. Then he said, "Will you give me permission?"and he said, "Yes." When he had a firm grip of him, he said, "Get him!" andthey killed him. Then they went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and informed him.<P><P><B>XIII: The killing of Abu Rafi' 'Abdullah ibn Abi'l-Huqayq.</B><P>It is said that he was Salam ibn Abi'l-Huqayq who was at Khaybar. It is saidthat he used to live in a fortress of his in the Hijaz. Az-Zuhri said, "Itwas after Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf."<P>3812. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent a group to Abu Rafi' and 'Abdullahibn 'Atik went into his house at night while he was asleep and killed him."<P>3813. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent some men of the Ansar to AbuRafi' the Jew and he put 'Abdullah ibn 'Atik in command of them. Abu Rafi'had been injuring the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and helping people against him. He was in a fortress of his in theHijaz. When they drew near to it after the sun had set and the people weretaking their herds home, 'Abdullah ibn 'Atik said to his companions, 'Staywhere you are and I will go. I will try to deceive the gatekeeper and getin.' He advanced until he was near the gate and then he covered himself withhis garment as if he was relieving himself. The people went in and the gatekeepercalled, 'O slave of 'Abdullah! if you want to come in, then come in! I wantto close the gate.' 'So I went in and concealed myself. When the people wentin, he locked the gates and then hung the keys on a peg.' He said, 'I wentto the keys and took them and opned the gate. Some people with talking withAbu Rafi' while he was in some high rooms of his. When the people he wasconversing with left him, I climbed up to him and whenever I opened a door,I would close it from the inside. I said, "If the people learn of me, theywill not get to me before I have killed him." I reached him and he was ina dark room in the midst of his family. I did not know where he was in theroom, so I said, "Abu Rafi'!" He said, "Who is it?" I made for the voiceand struck him a blow with the sword. I was confused and did not finish himand he shouted. I left the room and waited a short while and then went intohim and said, "What is this voice, Abu Rafi'?" He said, "Woe to your mother!A man in the house has struck me with a sword!"' He said, 'Then I struckhim forcefully but did not kill him. Then I placed the point of the swordon his belly until it reached his back. Then I knew that I had killed himand I began to open the doors one by one until I reached his staircase andput my foot down, thinking that I had reached the ground, and I fell in themoonlit night and broke my leg. I bound it with a turban and proceeded untilI sat at the gate. I said, "I will not go out tonight until I knew that Ihave killed him." When the cock crowed, someone stood on the wall and said,"I announce the death of Abu Rafi', the merchant of the people of the Hijaz!"Then I went to my companions and said, "Let's save ourselves! Allah has killedAbu Rafi'!" I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and reported it to him and he said, "Stretch out your leg." I stretched outmy leg and he rubbed it and it was as if there had never been anything wrongwith it.'"<P>3814. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,sent 'Abdullah ibn 'Atik and 'Abdullahibn 'Uqba with some people to Abu Rafi'. They went until they were near thefortress and 'Abdullah ibn 'Atik said to his companions, 'Stay until I goand have a look.' He said, 'I played a trick to enter the fortress.' Theyhad lost a donkey of theirs.' He said, 'They came out with a torch to lookfor it.' He said, 'I was afraid that they would recognise me, so I wrappedup my head as if I were relieving myself. Then the gatekeeper called, "Whoeverwants to come in, should come in before I close it!" So I went in and concealedmyself in the donkey-stall at the gate. They had supper with Abu Rafi' andconversed late into the night.. Then they returned to their houses. Whenthe voices were still and I did not hear any movement, I came out.' He said,'I had seen the gatekeeper put the key to the fortress in a hole and I tookit and opened the gate with it.' He said, 'I said, "If they discover me,I will escape easily." Then I went to the doors of their rooms and lockedthem from the outside. Then I climbed up to Abu Rafi' on a ladder. It wasa dark house and the lamp had been extinguished. I did not know where theman was. So I said, "Abu Rafi'!" He said, "Who is it?"' He said, 'I directedmyself towards the voice and struck him and he shouted and I did not finishthe thing.' He said, 'Then I came as if I was going to help him and, changingmy voice, I said, "What is wrong with you, Abu Rafi'?" He said, "Are younot amazed? Woe to your mother! A man has come in to me and struck me witha sword!"' He said, 'I directed myself at him again and struck him againand it did not accomplish anything. He shouted and his wife got up."' Hesaid, 'I then came with my voice changed as if I was a helper and he waslying on his back and I placed my sword on his belly and then pressed onit until I heard the sound of bone. Then I went out in confusion until Ireached the ladder. I meant to go down it, but I fell from it and silocatedmy leg. I bandaged it and then went limping to my companions, I said, "Goand inform the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.I will not leave until I hear the death announcer." At the beginning of morning,the death announcer climbed up and said, "I announce the death of Abu Rafi'."'He said, "I got up and walked without any defect until I caught up to mycompanions before they came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and I gave him the good news.'"<P><P><B>XIV: The expedition of Uhud</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Remember when you left your family earlyin the day to arrange the believers in their battle stations. Allah isAll-Hearing, All-Knowing."</I> (3:121)<P>And His words, may His mention be exalted, <I>"Do not give up and do notbe downhearted. You shall be uppermost if you are believers. If you havereceived a wound, they have already received a similar wound. We deal outsuch days to people turn by turn, so that Allah will know those who believeand can gather martyrs from among you. Allah does not love wrongdoers. Andso that Allah can purge those who believe and wipe out the rejectors. Ordid you imagine that you were going to enter the Garden without Allah knowingthose among you who had struggled and knowing the steadfast? You were longingfor death before you met it. Now you have seen it with your own eyes."</I>(3:139-143)<P>His words, <I>"Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you were slaughteringthem by His permission. But then you faltered, disputing the command, anddisobeyed after He showed you what you love. Among you are those who wantthis world and among you are those who want the Next World. Then He turnedyou from them in order to test you &#150; but He has pardoned you. Allahpossesses favour for the believers." </I>(3:152)<P>The words of the Almighty, <I>"Do not suppose that those killed in the Wayof Allah are dead. " </I>(2:169)<P>3815. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said on the Day of Badr, "This is Jibril, holding hishorse's head which is decked out for war."<P>3816. It is related from 'Uqba ibn 'Amir that Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and prayed over those killed at Uhud eightyears after the battle as if he was bidding farewell to the living and thedead. Then he stepped up onto the minbar and said, "I am going ahead of youand I am a witness over you. Your meeting-place with me is the Basin. I amlooking at it from where I am. I do not fear for you that you will associateothers with Allah. I fear this world for you and that you will vie with eachother for it." He said, "It was the last time I looked at the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."<P>3817. It is related that al-Bara' said, "On the day we met the idolaters,the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, placed thearchers and put 'Abdullah in charge of them: 'Do not leave. Even if you seethat we have defeated them, do not leave. If you see that they have defeatedus, do not leave.' When we met them, they fled until I saw the woman runningtowards the mountain, They defeated them and, by Allah, I saw the woman runningwith their legs and anklets showing. They began to say, 'Booty! Booty!' 'Abdullahsaid, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made me promisethat you would not leave.' They refused. When they refused, they were confusedabout which way to go and seventy were struck down. Abu Sufyan looked downand said, 'Is Muhammad among the people?' He said, 'Do not answer him.' Thenhe said, 'Is the son of Abu Quhafa among the people?' He said, 'Do not answerhim.'. Then he said, 'Is the son of al-Khattab among the people?' Then hesaid, 'Those have been killed. If they had been alive, they would have answered.''Umar could not restrain himself and said, 'By Allah, you have lied, enemyof Allah! All of those you numbered are among the living! That which willvex you remains!' Abu Sufyan said, ''Hubal be high!' The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Answer him!' They said, 'What shallwe say?' He said, 'Say: "Allah is Higher and More Majestic."' Abu Sufyansaid, We have al-'Uzza and you have no 'Uzza.' The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'Answer him!' They said, 'What shall we say?'He said, 'Say: "Allah is our Protector and you have Protector."' Abu Sufyan,'A day which is in return for the day of Badr. Victory in war goes in turns.You will find some of the people mutiliated. I did not order it, but it doesnot vex me.'"<P>3818. It is related that Jabir said, "Some people took wine on the morningof Uhud and then were killed as martyrs."<P>3819. It is related that Ibrahim said, "One day 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf wasbrought his food while he was fasting and he said, 'Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr waskilled and he was a better man than I and he was shrouded in a cloak. Ifhis head was covered, his feet showed, and if his feet were covered, hishead showed." I saw him say, "Hamza was killed and he was a better man thanI. Worldly goods have been opened up to us - or he said, "We have been givenof this world, - and we fear that our good deeds have been brought forwardfor us." Then he started to weep to the extent that he neglected his food."<P><A HREF="muw8.html#42">3820</A>. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said,"A man said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on theday of Uhud, 'Where do you think that I will be if I am killed?' He said,'In the Garden.' So he threw away some dates that were in his hand and thenfought until he was killed.'"<P>3821. It is related that Khabbab ibn al-Aratt said, "We emigrated with theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the sakeof Allah and our reward was mandatory and in the hands of Allah. Some ofus died, or left, without tasting any of his reward, and one of them wasMus'ab ibn 'Umayr. He was killed on the day of Uhud and we did not find anythingto shroud him with except for a cloak. When we covered his head with it,his feet stuck out, and when we covered his feet, his head stuck o ut. Sothe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to us, 'Coverhis head and put <I>idhkhir</I>-herb on his feet,' or he said, 'Throw someidhkhir-herb on his feet.' Some of us had its fruit ripen and plucked it.<P>3822. It is related that Anas said, "My uncle missed the fighting at Badrand said, 'I missed the first battle of the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace. If Allah gives me the opportunity to be present withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Allah will see whatI shall do!' He met the Day of Uhud. When the people were routed, he said,'O Allah, I apologise to You for what these people have done (i.e. the Muslims)and I declare myself innocent to You of what the idolaters have done.' Thenhe went forward with his sword and met Sa'd ibn Mu'adh. He said, 'Where to,O Sa'd! I smell the fragrance of the Garden from below Uhud!' He proceededand was slain. He could not be recognised until his sister recognised a mole- or his fingertips. He had about eighty wounds, sword thrusts or spear stabsor arrows."<P>3823. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "When we copied out the copiesof the Qur'an and I missed one ayat of <I>Surat al-Ahzab</I> which I usedto hear the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,recite. We looked for it and found it with Khuzayma ibn Thabit al-Ansari.It is: 'Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenantwith Allah.' So we joined it to its <I>sura</I> in the copy of the Qur'an."<P>3824. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said, "When the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, went out to Uhud, some of the people who setout with him turned back. The Companions of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, fell into two groups. One group said, 'We will fightthem,' and one group said, 'We will not fight them.' So it was revealed,<I>'Why is it that you have become two parties regarding the hypocrites,when Allah has returned them to unbelief for what they did?' </I>(4:88) TheProphet, 'It expels men as fire expels the impurities of iron.'"<P><P><B>XV: <I>"And when two of your clans were on the point of losing heart andAllah was their Protector. Let the believers put their trust in Allah."</I>(3:122)</B><P>3825. It is related that Jabir said, "This verse, 'Remember two of your partnersmeditated cowardice,' was sent down about us, the Banu Salima and the BanuHaritha. I would not have liked that it not have sent down when Allah says,'But Allah was their protector.'"<P>3826. It is related that Jabir said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' He said,'A virgin or a woman who was married previously?' I said, 'A woman who wasmarried previously.' He said, 'Why not a virgin who could play with you?'I said, 'Messenger of Allah, my father was killed at Uhud and left ninedaughters. I did not like to marry an inexperienced girl like them, but rathera woman who could comb their hair and take care of them.' He said, 'You areright.'"<P>3827. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that his father was marytredon the day of Uhud and left debts and left six daughter. When it was timeto harvest the dates, he said, "I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and said, 'You know that my father was martyredon the day of Uhud and left many debts and I would like for the creditorsto see you.' He said, 'Go and put every type of date in a different place.'I did that and then called him. When they saw them, they immediately beganto press me, When he saw what they were doing, he walked around the greatestpile of dates three times and then sat over it and said, 'Call your companionsfor me.' He continued to weigh for them until Allah paid the debts of myfather. I would have been satisfied that Allah had settled the debts of myfather and I had not a single date to take back to my sisters. But Allahsaved all the heaps, and I even looked at the heap where the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;had been and it was as if it hadnot been decreased by a single date."<P>3828. It is related that Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas said, "I saw the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of Uhud and twomen were with him fighting for him. They were wearing white clothes, andfighting as fiercely as possible. I never saw them before or after."<P>3829. It is related that Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, turned out his quiver of arrows for me onthe Day of Uhud and said, 'Shoot, may my father and mother be your ransom.'"<P>3830. It is related that Sa'd said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, mentioned both his parents for me on the Day of Uhud [i.e.saying, "May my father and mother be your ransom."]."<P>3831. It is related that Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, mentioned both his parents for me on the Dayof Uhud," i.e. when he said, "May my father and mother be your ransom." whilehe was fighting.<P>3832. It is related that 'Ali said, "I did not see the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, saying, 'May my father and mother be yourransom' to any man except Sa'd."<P>3833. It is related that 'Ali said, "I did not see the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, saying, 'May my father and mother be yourransom' to any man after Sa'd ibn Malik. I heard him say on the Day of Uhud,'Shoot, may my father and mother be your ransom!'"<P>3834. It is related that Abu 'Uthman stated, "In one of the battles in whichthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was fighting,only Talha and Sa'd remained with him as they related."<P>3835. It is related that as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid said, "I accompanied Talha ibn'Ubaydullah, Sa'd, al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Awf andI did not hear any of them relate from the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, except that I heard Talha reporting aboutthe Battle of Uhud."<P>3836. It is related that Qays said, "I saw the hand of Talha with which heprotected the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and had becomeparalysed."<P>3837. It is related that Anas said, "On the Day of Uhud, the people wererouted and fled, leaving the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.Abu Talha was in front of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, was shielding him with his shield. Abu Talha was an archer with astrong bow-arm. On that day he broke two or three bows. If a man passed bywith a quiver of arrows, he would say, 'Put them out for Abu Talha.' TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to look over at thepeople and Abu Talha would say, 'O Prophet of Allah, may my mother and fatherbe your ransom, do not look over lest one of the arrows of the people strikeyou! My upper chest is in front of yours!' I saw 'A'isha bint Abi Bakr andUmm Sulaym with their skirts rolled up so that I could see their anklets,hurrying with the waterskins on their backs. Then they would pour the waterin the mouths of the the people and then go back to fill them up and thencome back and pour it in the mouths of the people. Abu Talha's sword fellfrom is hand two or three times."<P>3838. It is related that 'A'isha said, "On the Day of Uhud when the idolaterswere defeated, Iblis, may Allah's curse be on him, shouted, 'O slaves ofAllah! Watch your backs!&Otilde;'and the first of them turned back to fightthe last of them. Hudhayfa looked, and there was his father, al-Yaman, andhe cried out, 'O slaves of Allah! My father! My father!'" She said, "By Allah,they did not leave him until they had killed him. Hudhayfa said, 'May Allahforgive them.&Otilde;''Urwa said, 'Hudhayfa continued to pray for good regardingit until he met Allah, the Mighty and Exalted.'"<P><I>Basura</I> is to know, from having <I>bas&icirc;ra</I> (insight) in amatter, and <I>absara</I> comes from direct sight with the eye. It is alsosaid that <I>basura</I> and <I>absara</I> are the same.<P><P><B>XVI: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Those of you who turned their backson the day the two armies clashed &#150; it was Shaytan who made them slipfor what they had done. But Allah has pardoned them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving,All-Forbearing." </I>(3:155)</B><P>3839. It is related that 'Uthman ibn Mawhab said, "A man Egypt came and madethe pilgrimage to the House. He saw some people sitting and said, 'Who arethose seated people?' They said, 'Those are Quraysh.&Otilde; He asked, 'Whois the old man?' They answered, 'Ibn 'Umar.&Otilde;'He went to him and said,'I would ask you about something. Will you tell me? I adjure you by thesacredness of this House, do you know that 'Uthman ibn 'Affan fled on theDay of Uhud?&Otilde; He said, 'Yes.&Otilde; He said, 'Do you know that hewas absent from Badr and not present at it?&Otilde; He replied, 'Yes.&Otilde;He said, 'Do you know that he was failed to attend the Pledge of Ridwan andwas not present at it?&Otilde; He replied, 'Yes.&Otilde; The man said, 'Allahis greater!' Ibn 'Umar said, 'Let me now inform you and explain to you whatyou asked about. As for his fleeing from Uhud, I testify that Allah pardonedhim and forgave him. As for being absent from Badr, he was married to thedaughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,who was ill and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said to him, "You will have the reward and share of a man who waspresent at Badr." As for his being absent from the Pledge of Ridwab, if therehad been anyone dearer than 'Uthman in the valley of Makka, he would havesent him in his place. He sent 'Uthman and the Pledge of Ridwan took placeafter 'Uthman had gone to Makka. Therefore the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said of his right hand, "This is the hand of 'Uthman,"and struck it against his other hand and said, "This is for 'Uthman." Takethis with you now.'"<P><P><B>XVII:<I> "Remember when you were scrambling up the slope, refusing toturn back for anyone, and the Messenger was calling to you from the rear.Allah rewarded you with one distress in return for another so you would notfeel grief for what escaped you and what assailed you. Allah is aware ofeverything you do.</I>" (3:153)</B><P>3840. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib was heard to say, "On the Dayof Uhud, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, put 'Abdullahibn Jubayr in charge of the infantry.They were defeated, and that is, 'theMessenger in your rear was calling you back.'"<P><P><B>XVIII: Chapter: </B><P><I>"Then He sent down to you, after the distress, security, restful sleepovercoming a group of you. Whereas another group became prey to anxious thoughts,thinking other than the truth about Allah &#150; thoughts belonging to thedays of ignorance &#150; saying, 'Do we have any say in the affair at all?'Say, 'The affair belongs entirely to Allah.' They are concealing things insidethemselves they do not disclose to you, saying, 'If we had only had a sayin the affair, none of us would have been killed here in this place.' Say,'Even if you had been inside your homes, those people for whom killing wasdecreed would have gone out to their place of death.' So that Allah mighttest what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. Allah knowswhat the hearts contain."</I> (3:155)<P>3841. It is related that Abu Talha said, "I was one of those overcome byslumber on the Day of Uhud so that my sword fell from my hand several times,and then I would pick it up and it would fall and I would pick it again."<P><P><B>XIX:<I> "You have no part in the affair. Either He will turn to them orHe will punish them, for they are the wrongdoers." </I>(3:128)</B><P>Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, receiveda face wound on the Day of Uhud and he said, 'How can a people prosper whoinjure their Prophet's face?' and it was sent down, 'Not for thee, (but forAllah), is the decision.'"<P>3842. It is related from Salim's father that he heard the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say when he raised his head fromthe first <I>rak'at</I> of Fajr, "O Allah, curse so-and-so, so-and-so, andso-and-so" after he said, "Allah hears whoever praises Him. Our Lord, praiseis Yours." Then Allah sent down, "<I>You have no part in the affair. EitherHe will turn to them or He will punish them, for they are the wrongdoers."</I>(3:128)<P><P><B>XX: Concerning Umm Salit</B><P>3843. It is related from Tha'laba ibn Abi Malik that 'Umar ibn al-Khattabdivided up some garments among some of the women of Madina. One excellentgarment remained and one of those with him said, "Amir al-Mu'minin! Givethis to the (grand)daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, to whom you are married (meaning Umm Kultum bint 'Ali)."'Umar said, "Umm Salit is more entitled to it." Umm Salit was one of thepeople of the Ansar who had given allegiance to the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace. 'Umar said, "She carried waterskinsfor us on the Day of Uhud."<P><P><B>XXI: The killing of Hamza ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib</B><P>3844. It is related that Ja'far ibn 'Amr ibn Umayya ad-Damri said, "I wentout with 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Adi ibn al-Khiyar. When we reached Hims, 'Ubaydullahibn 'Adi said to me, 'Would you like to meet Wahshi so we can ask him aboutthe killing of Hamza?' I replied, 'Yes.' Wahshi was living in Hims. We askedabout him and were told, 'He is that one in the shade of his castle as ifhe were a full skin.'" He said, "We went and stopped a short distance fromhim and greeted him and he returned the greeting." He said, "'Ubaydullah'shead was wrapped up in his turban and Wahshi could only see his eyes andfeet. 'Ubaydullah said, 'Wahshi! Do you recognise me?'" He said, "He lookedat him and then said, 'No, by Allah. But I know that 'Adi ibn al-Khiyar marrieda woman called Umm Qital bint Abi'l-'Is, and she bore him a boy in Makkaand I looked for a wet-nurse for him. I carried that boy with his motherand handed him over, and looking at your feet, they resemble them.'" He said,'So 'Ubaydullah uncovered his face and and then said, 'Will you tell us aboutthe killing of Hamza?' He said, 'Yes. Hamza had killed Tu'ayma ibn 'Adi ibnal-Khiyar at Badr and my master, Jubayr ibn Mut'im, said to me, "If you killHamza for my uncle, then you are free."' He said, 'When the people set outin the year of 'Aynayn - and 'Aynayn is a mountain near Uhud, with a valleyseparating them - I went out with the people for the fighting. When the battlelines were drawn, Siba' went out and said, "Is there any who will come forth[to fight me]?" Hamza ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib came out to him and said, "O Siba'!O Ibn Umm Anmar, the woman who circumcised women! Do you oppose Allah andHis Messenger?"' He said, 'Then he attacked him, and he was history.' Hesaid, 'I concealed myself behind a rock for Hamza. When he came near me,I threw my spear at him, driving it into his navel until it emerged betweenhis buttocks.' He said, 'That was the end of him. When the people returned,I returned with them, and I stayed in Makka until Islam spread in it. ThenI went out to Ta'if. They sent a messenger to the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and I was told that he did not harmmessengers.' He said, 'So I went out with the them until I came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When he saw me, he said,"You are Wahshi." I said, "Yes." He said, "It is you who killed Hamza." Isaid, "The business is as you have heard." He said, "Can you remove yourface from me?"' He said, 'I went out. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, died, Musaylima the Liar emerged and I said,"I will go out against Musaylima and perhaps I will kill him to compensatefor Hamza."' He said, 'I went out with the people and what happened happened.'He said, 'There was a man standing by a gap in the wall, looking like anash-coloured camel with his hair dishevelled.' He said, 'I threw my spearand it went into his cheat and came out between his shoulder." He said, 'Thena man of the Ansar attacked himand struck him on the head with a sword.'"<P>'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "A slave-girl on the roof of a house said, 'TheCommander of the Believers has been killed by a black slave!'"<P><P><B>XX: The wounds which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,received on the Day of Uhud</B><P>3845. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The wrath of Allah is severeagainst a people who done this to His Prophet," pointing at his tooth, "Thewrath of Allah is severe against a man who was killed by the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the way of Allah."<P>3846. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The wrath of Allah is severe againsta man who was killed by the Prophet*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,in the way of Allah. The wrath of Allah is severe against a people who bloodiedthe face of the Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."<P>3847. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd was asked about the wound of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of Uhud. He said, "ByAllah, I know who washed the face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and who poured the water and with what he was treated."He said, "Fatima, peace be upon her, washed the blood away while 'Ali pouredthe water from a shield. When she saw that it increased the bleeding, shetook a piece of mat and burned it and then applied it and the bleeding stopped.That day his front-tooth broken and his face was injured, and his helmetwas smashed on his head."<P>3848. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The wrath of Allah is severe againstsomeone killed by a Prophet, and the wrath of Allah is severe against a peoplewho bloodied the face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace."<P><P><B>XXIII: <I>"Those who responded to Allah and the Messenger."</I>(3:172)</B><P>3849. It is related from 'A'isha about<I>, "Those who who did good and weregodfearing &nbsp;among those who responded to Allah and the Messenger, afterthe wound had been inflicted, will have an immense reward."</I> (3:172) Shesaid to 'Urwa, My nephew, your fathers, az-Zubayr and Abu Bakr, were amongthem on the day on Uhud when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was afflicted by what he was afflicted. The idolatersleft him and he feared that he might return and said, 'Who will go afterthem?' He selected seventy men from them.'" He said, "Abu Bakr and az-Zubayrwere among them."<P><P><B>XXIV: The Muslims killed in the Battle of Uhud</B><P>They included Hamza ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib, al-Yaman, Anas ibn Nadr, and Mus'abibn 'Umayr.<P>3850. It is related that Qatada said, "We do not know of any tribe amongthe Arabs who had more martyrs and will be more exalted on the Day of Risingthan the Ansar."<P>It is related from Anas ibn Malik that seventy of them were killed in theBattle of Uhud and seven in the Battle of Bi'r Ma'una, and seventy in thebattle of Yamana. Anas said, "Bi'r Ma'una was in the time of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Yamana was int hetime of Abu Bakr, the day of the (battle against) Musaylima the Liar."<P>3851. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, put two of those killed at Uhudinto a single garment. Then he asked, 'Which of them knew more of the Qur'an?'When one of them was indicated, he put him first in the grave and said, 'Iwill be a witness for these on the Day of Rising.' He instructed that theybe buried covered in their blood and not washed or prayed over."<P>3852. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "When my father was killed,I began to weep and went to uncover his face and my people forbade me todo it. Then I started to uncover him and the Companions of the Prophet stoppedme, but the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not stopme. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not weepfor him. The angels continued to shade him with their wings until he waslifted up.'"<P>3853. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "I dreamt that I brandished a sword and its bladebroke. It was what was inflicted on the believers on the Day of Uhud. ThenI brandished it again and it returned better than it was. That was what Allahbrought of the Conquest and the gathering of the believers. In it I saw cattle,and &nbsp;Allah is good. They were the believers on the Day of Uhud."<P>3854. It is related that Khabbab ibn al-Aratt said, "We emigrated with theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the sakeof Allah and our reward was mandatory and in the hands of Allah. Some ofus died, or left, without tasting any of his reward, and one of them wasMus'ab ibn 'Umayr. He was killed on the day of Uhud and we did not find anythingto shroud him with except for a cloak. When we covered his head with it,his feet stuck out, and when we covered his feet, his head stuck o ut. Sothe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to us, 'Coverhis head and put <I>idhkhir</I>-herb on his feet,' or he said, 'Throw some<I>idhkhir</I>-herb on his feet.' Some of us had its fruit ripen and pluckedit."<P><P><B>XXV: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Uhudloves us and we love it."</B><P>3855. It is related that Anas was heard to say that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "This is a mountain which loves us andwe love it."<P>3856. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said that when Uhud loomed beforethe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he said,"This is a mountain that loves us and we love it. O Allah, Ibrahim made Makkaa Haram and I made what is between its two lava beds a Haram.'"<P>3857. It is related from 'Uqba ibn 'Amir, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, went out one day and prayed over the people of Uhudwith the prayer for the dead. Then he went to the minbar and said, 'I willprepare things for you and will be a witness for you. By Allah, I see myBasin now and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth (orthe keys of the earth). By Allah, I do not fear for you that you will associateanything with Allah after me, but I fear for you that you will fight oneanother for them.'"<P><P><B>XXVI: The expedition of ar-Raji', Ri'l. Dhakwan, and Bi'r Ma'una, andthe story about 'Adal and al-Qara with 'Asim ibn Thabit, Khubayb and hiscompanions</B><P>Ibn Ishaq said that 'Asim ibn 'Umar related that it took place after Uhud.<P>3858. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent out ten men on a spying expedition andput 'Asim ibn Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of 'Asim ibn 'Umar ibnal-Khattab, in command of them. They proceeded until they were between 'Usfanand Makka. Their presence was reported to a branch of Hudhayl called theBanu Lihyan. About a hundred archers, pursued them. They followed their tracksuntil they came to a place where they had camped and found the pits of thedates which they had taken as provision from Madina. They said, 'These arethe dates of Yathrib,' and they followed their tracks until they caught upto them.<P>"When 'Asim and his companions could not advance, they took cover in a highplace. The people came and surrounded them and said, 'If you come down tous, you have protection and assurance that we will not kill any of you!''Asim ibn Thabit said, 'I will not come down into the protection of anunbeliever! O Allah, inform Your Prophet about us!' They shot at them witharrows and killed seven of them, including 'Asim. Khubayb, Zayd and anotherman remained to whom they gave the promise of protection and security andthey came down to them. When they had them in their power, they undid theirbow-strings and tied them up. Then the third man who was with them said,'This is the beginning of treachery!' He refused to accompany them. Theydragged him and tried to persuade him to accompany them. but he would notdo it, so they killed him. They took Khubayb and Zayd ibn Dathina and soldthem in Makka.<P>"The sons of al-Harith ibn 'Amir ibn Nawfal ibn bought Khubayb. Khubayb wasthe one who had killed al-Harith in the Battle of Badr. So Khubayb remaineda prisoner with them until they agreed to kill him."<P>"He asked to borrow a razor from one of the daughters of al-Harith with whichto shave his private parts and she lent it to him. She said, 'I was not payingattention and a son of mine went right up to him and he took him and puthim on his thigh. When I saw him I was so alarmed that he noticed it whilethe razor was in his hand. He said, "Are you afraid that I will kill him?Allah willing, I would never do that."' She used to say, 'By Allah, I neversaw a better prisoner than Khyubayb. By Allah, I found him eating from abunch of grapes he had in his hand, when he was shackled in irons and therewas no fruit at that time in Makka. It was provision from Allah which Hegave to Khubayb.' When they brought him out of the Haram to kill him in profaneland, he said to them, 'Let me pray two <I>rak'ats</I>.' Then he turned tothem and said, 'By Allah, were it not that you might think that I was afraid,I would have made them longer'. He was the first to make the <I>sunna</I>for every Muslim man who is killed to pray two <I>rak'ats</I>. Then he said,'O Allah, reckon them one by one!' He then said:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  'I do not care what manner death I die  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if I am slain as a Muslim!  <P>  That is for the sake of Allah, and if He wills,  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; He can bless the joints of a torn limb!'</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>"Then 'Uqba ibn al-Harith went to him and killed him. Quraysh sent some peopleto 'Asim to bring part of his body which could be recognised. 'Asim had beenone of their great men in the Battle of Badr. Allah sent over him a swarmof bees like a cloud and it protected him from their messengers and theycould not cut off any part of him."<P>3859. It is related that Jabir was heard to say, "The one who killed Khubaybwas Abu Saraw'a."<P>3860. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, sent some seventy men called the Recitors on an errand.Two tribes of the Banu Sulaym, Ri'l and Dhakwan, appeared before them ata well called Bi'r Ma'una.. The people said to them, 'By Allah, we have notcome against you, but we are passing by on an errand for the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace.' But they killed them, and so the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cursed them in the morning prayerfor a month. That was the beginning of the <I>qunut</I>. We had not donethe <I>qunut</I>.'"<P>A man asked Anas about whether the <I>qunut</I> was after or before <I>ruku'</I>or at the end of the recitation. He said, "No, it is after the end ofthe recitation."<P>3861. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said the <I>qunut</I> after <I>ruku' </I>for a month,cursing some Arab tribes."<P>3862. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "Ri'l, Dhakwan, 'Usayya andBanu Lihyan had asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, for reinforcements against their enemy, and so he reinforced themwith seventy of the Ansar whom we used to call the recitors. They would collectwood by day and pray by night. When they are Bi'r Ma'una, they killed themand betrayed them. That reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, did the <I>qunut</I> in the morning for a month in which he cursedsome of the Arab tribes: Ri'l, Dhakwan, 'Usayya and Banu Lihyan." Anas said,"We used to recite some Qur'an about them before it was removed: 'Conveyto our people that we have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and weare pleased'."<P>3863. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, did the <I>qunut</I> in the <I>Subh</I> prayer,cursing some of the Arab tribes: Ri'l, Dhakwan, 'Usayya and Banu Lihyan.<P>It is added that Anas said, "There were seventy of the Ansar who were killedat Bi'r Ma'una."<P>3864. It is related from Anas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, sent my uncle, the brother of Umm Sulayman, with seventy riders.The leader of the idolworshippers, 'Amir ibn Tufayl, had proposed threealternatives. He said, 'the people of the deserts will be yours and the peopleof the towns mine, or I will be your successor, or I will attack you withtwo thousand of the people of Ghatafan. But 'Amir succumbed to the plaguein the house of Umm so-and-so. He said, 'Will I remain in the house of awoman from the family of so-and-so after having a ganglion like a she-camel?Bring me my horse!' And he died on his horse's back. Haram, the brother ofUmm Sulaym, a lame man, and a man of the Banu so-and-so went. He said, 'Youtwo stay near me until I get to them. If they give me security, you willbe there. If they kill me, then go to your companions.' He said, 'Will yougrant me security to convey the message of the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace?'.' He began to speal to them and they madea gesture to a man who came at him from behind and stabbed him (Hammam said,"I think it is, 'right through him.') He said, 'Allah is greater! By theLord of the Ka'ba, I have won!' The other was was pursued and they killedall of them except for the lame man who climbed to the top of a mountain.They Allah sent down on us a verse that was later among the abrogated: 'Wehave met our Lord and He is pleased with us and We are pleased.' The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cursed them for thirty mornings- against Ri'l, Dhakwan, Banu Lihyan and Banu 'Usayya who disobeyed Allahand His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."<P>3865. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say that when Haramibn Milhan, his uncle, was stabbed on the day of Bi'r Ma'una, he sprinkledblood over his face and head and then said, "By the Lord of the Ka'ba, Ihave won!"<P>3866. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Abu Bakr asked the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, for permission to leave when the abuse againsthim became intense, but he told him 'Wait.' He said, 'Messenger of Allah,do you hope to be given permission?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'I hope for that.'" She said, "So Abu Bakrwaited for him. One day the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, came to him at midday. He called him and said, 'Send out thosewho are with you.' Abu Bakr said, 'Messenger of Allah, they are my twodaughters.' He said, 'Are you aware that I have been given permission toleave?' He said, 'In company, Messenger of Allah?' The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'In company.' He said, 'Messenger ofAllah, I have two she-camels which I have made ready to leave.' So he gavethe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, one of them. It wasal-Jad'a'. They proceeded until they reached the cave which is in Thawr andhid themselves. 'Amir ibn Fuhayra, the slave of 'Abdullah ibn at-Tufayl ibnSakhbara, 'A'isha's half brother by her mother, would graze some milk camelbelonging to Abu Bakr, taking it to them to them morning and evening. Hewould go out at the end of the end to them and then go on to pasture, sothat none of the shepherds would become aware of it. When the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, left, he left with them, and followedthem to Madina. 'Amir ibn Fuhayra was killed on the Day of Bi'r Ma'una."<P>3867. It is related that 'Urwa said, "When those at Bi'r Ma'una were killedand 'Amr ibn Umayya ad-Damra taken prisoner, 'Amir ibn at-Tufayl said tohim, 'Who is this?' pointing at a dead person. 'Amr ibn Umayya said, 'Thisis 'Amir ibn Fuhayra.' He said, 'After he was killed, I saw him being raisedto heaven until I could see sky between him and the earth, and then he wasput down.' The news about them reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and he said, 'Your companions have been killed, and theyasked their Lord, saying, "O Allah! Convey to our brothers that we are pleasedwith You and You are pleased with us" So He informed them.'" On that day'Urwa ibn Asma' ibn as-Salt was killed, and 'Urwa was named after him. Mundhirwas named after Mundhir ibn 'Amr.<P>3868. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, did the <I>qanut</I> after<I> ruku' </I>for a month, prayingagainst Ri'l and Dhakwan, and he used to say, ''Usayya disobeyed Allah andHis Messenger."<P>3869. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "For thirty mornings the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, invoked against those who killedhis Companions at Bi'r Ma'una. During this time, he invoked against Ri'land Lihyan, and [he said,] ''Usayya disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.'"Anas said, "Allah Almighty sent down some Qur'an to His Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, about those who were killed, the people ofBi'r Ma'una, which we used to recite and which was later abrogated: 'Conveyto our people that we have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and weare pleased'."<P>3870. It is related that 'Asim al-Ahwal said, "I asked Anas ibn Malik aboutthe <I>qunut</I> in the prayer and he said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Before or after<I>ruku'</I>?' He replied, 'Before it.' I said, 'Someone told me that yousaid it was done after <I>ruku'</I>. He said, 'He lied. The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, only did the <I>qunut</I>after <I>ruku'</I> for a month.He had sent out a group of people called "thereciters" numbering about seventy men to a group of idolaters who had a treatywith the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, butthose who had a treaty with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, overpowered those men and so the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, did the <I>qunut</I> after <I>ruku'</I>for a month to make supplication against them.'"<P><P><B>XXVII: The expedition of the Ditch, which is the Confederates</B><P>Musa ibn 'Uqba said that it took place in Shawwal, 4 AH.<P>3871. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, turned him away on the day of Uhud when he was fourteenand did not allow him (to participate). Then he summoned him on the Day ofthe Ditch when he was fifteen and allowed me [to participate]."<P>3872. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "We were with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the Ditch, and theywere digging while we were carrying the earth on our shoulders. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'O Allah, thereis no life but the life of the Next World, so forgive the Ansar and theMuhajirun!'"<P>3873. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, went out to the Ditch, and the Muhajirunand the Ansar were digging on a cold morning and they did not have any slavesto do that for them. When he say the fatigue and hunger they had, he said,'O Allah, life is the life of the Next World, so forgive the Ansar and theMuhajirun!' They answered him, saying,<BLOCKQUOTE>  'We are those who have given allegiance to Muhammad  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; to always fight in jihad as long as we live!'"</BLOCKQUOTE><P>3874. It is related that Anas said, "The Muhajirun and Ansar were diggingthe Ditch around Madina and moving the earth on their backs, saying,<BLOCKQUOTE>  'We are those who have given allegiance to Muhammad  <P>  to always fight in jihad as long as we live!'"</BLOCKQUOTE><P>He said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was sayingin reply to him, 'O Allah, there is no good but the good of the Next World,so bless the Ansar and the Muhajirun!'"<P>He said, "They would bring a handful of barley and it would be prepared forthem by using rancid fat and it would be placed before the people who werehungry, and it would stick in their throats and it had and unpleasant smell."<P>3875. It is related that Jabir said, "On the Day of the Ditch, we were diggingand a hard bit of rock became exposed. They went to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and said, "'There is a hard bit of rock exposedin the Ditch.' He said, 'I am coming down.' He got up and there was a stonetied to his belly. We had been three days without eating at all. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took a pick and struck it and itbecame like soft sand. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, give me permission togo to my house.' I said to my wife, 'I see that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, is in a condition I cannot bear. Do you have anything?'She said, 'I have some barley and a lamb.' So I sacrificed the lamb and sheground the barley and we put the meat in a cooking-pot. Then I went to theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when the thebread was kneaded and the pot was on the cooking stones and nearly cookedand said, 'I have a little food, so, Messenger of Allah, come with one ortwo men.' He said, 'How much is it?' I told him and he said, 'Abundant andgood. Tell her not to remove the pot nor take the bread from the oven untilI come.' He said, 'Get up,' and the Muhajirun and Ansar got up. I went toher and said, 'Poor you! The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,the Muhajirun, the Ansar and those with them have all come!' She said, 'Didhe ask you?' I said. 'Yes.' He said, 'Enter, but do not crowd round.' Hebegan to break up the bread and put meat on it, covering the pot and ovenafter he took something from them. He gave it to his Companions who thenwithdrew. He continued to breaking up bread and ladling until they were fulland there was still some left. He said, 'Eat this and give some away forhunger has afflicted the people.'"<P>3876. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "When the ditch was dug,I saw that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was hungry,so I went back to my wife and said, 'Do you have anything? I see that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is very hungry.'She brought out a bag which contained a <I>sa' </I>of barley. We had a lambwe had kept at home, so I slaughtered it and she ground the barley. I finishedand cut it up in her cooking-pot. Then I turned to go back to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. She said, 'Do not disgraceme before the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and those with him.' I went to him and spoke confidentially to him, 'Messengerof Allah, we have slaughtered a small lamb of ours and ground a <I>sa' </I>ofbarley, so let you and a few people come.' The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, shouted, 'People of the Ditch! Jabir has prepared somefood, so come along!' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Do not remove your pot nor bake your bread until I come.' I came andthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came leading the people.I went to my wife and she said, 'It is all your fault!' I said, 'I did whatyou said.' She brought out the dough and he spat in it and blessed it. Thenhe went to our pot and spat and blessed it. Then he said, 'Call the womanwho bakes and let her bake with you, and ladle from your pot and do not removeit.' There were a thousand of them. I swear by Allah, they ate until theyleft the food and went away. Our pot was boiling as before and out doughwas baking as before."<P>3877. It is related from 'A'isha about, "Behold!

I head himchanting the rhymes of the words of Ibn Rawaha while he was moving the dirt.He was saying,<BLOCKQUOTE>  'By Allah, if it had been for Allah, we would not  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; have been guided, given sadaqa nor prayed.  <P>  Send down calmness on it and make our feet firm  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp;when we meet the enemy.  <P>  Those have attacked us.

They are waiting for you and I fear that ifyou fail to go to them it will cause division.' She kept at him until hewent. When they people split up, Mu'awiya gave a speech and said, 'Whoeverwants to speak about this matter should show himself to us. We are more entitledto it than him and his father.' Habib ibn Maslama said, 'Why did't you answerhim?' 'Abdullah said, 'I unwrapped my garment and wanted to say, "The onewho fought you and your father for the sake of Islam is more entitled thanyou to this command," but I feared that I would utter a word which wouldcause division between the community and cause blood to be shed and whatI said might be taken other than how I meant it to be understood. So I rememberedwhat Allah has prepared in the Gardens.' Habib said, 'You were preservedand protected.'"<P>Mahmud said that 'Abdu'r-Razzaq has "<I>naws&acirc;tuh&acirc;</I>" (insteadof "<I>nasw&acirc;tuh&acirc;</I>" (locks).<P>3883.

The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'By Allah, I have not prayed either!' We wentto Buthan and he did <I>wudu'</I> for the prayer and so did we.

Umm Ayman came and put the garment around my neck andsaid, 'No, by the One who is the only God, he will not give them to you ashe has given them to me,' or words to that effect. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'You will have others in return,' anshe said, 'No, Allah,' until (I think he said) he gave her tens times thelike of them," or words to that effect.<P>3895.

He said, 'You have given the judgement of Allah regardingthem (or he may have said,.'the judgement of the King.)"<P>3896. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Sa'd was wounded on the Day of theDitch when a man of Quraysh called Hibban ibn al-'Ariqa shot him. He shothim in the mdial arm vein. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, set up a tent in the mosque so that he would be near for him to visithim. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, returnedfrom the Ditch, he put down his weapons and washed. Jibril, peace be uponhim, came to him and said, 'You have put down your arms. By Allah, I havenot put mine down. Go out to them!' He said, 'Where?' He pointed towardsthe Banu Qurayza. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, went to them and they agreed to his judgement and he gave the judgementto Sa'd. He said, 'My judgement regarding them is that the fighters be killedand the women and children taken captive and their property divided up.'"<P>It is related from 'A'isha that Sa'd said, "O Prophet, You know that thereis no one I love to fight for Your sake more than a people who have deniedYour Messenger , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and expelled him!O Allah, I think that You have settled the war between us and them. If anyof the war against Quraysh remained, then make me last for it so that I canfight them for Your sake. If the war is settled, then make the wound burstand make it the cause of my death!" It burst from his upper chest but hedid not alert them. There was a tent of the Banu Ghifar in the mosque andthe blood flowed towards them. They said, "People of tent!

We wrapped our feet in rags and so it became calledthe Expedition of Rags since we wrapped our feet in rags." Abu Burda said,"Abu Musa related this hadith to us and then disliked having done so andsaid, 'I wish I had not mentioned it!'" He said, "It was as if he dislikedany of his actions being disclosed."<P>3900.

Jabir said, "We went to sleep and then theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called us andwe came. There was a bedouin sitting with him and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'This one unsheathed my swordwhile I was asleep. I woke up and he had it unsheathed in his hand and hesaid to me, "Who will protect you from me?" I said, "Allah."

It is the expeditionof al-Muraysi'</B><P>Ibn Ishaq said that it was in 6 AH, but Musa ibn 'Uqba says it was 4 AH.<P>Az-Zuhri said, "The story of the Lie is in the expedition of al-Muraysi'."<P>3907. It is related that Ibn Muhayriz said, "I entered the mosque and sawAbu Sa'id al-Khudri, so I sat down beside him and asked him about coitusinterruptus. Abu Sa'id said, 'We went out with the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, on the attack against the Banu'l-Mustaliq.We took from Arab captives and we desired the women as the separation hadbeen hard on us, and we wanted to practise coitus interruptus. We said, "Willwe practise coitus interruptus while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, is among us before we ask him?" So we asked himabout that and he said, "There is nothing that says you should not do it.There is no soul which exists until the Day of Rising but that it will be."'"<P>3908. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "We went on an expedition with the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, in the direction of Najd.

While we were like that, theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called us andwe came. There was a bedouin sitting before him and he, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, 'This one came to me while I was asleep and unsheathedmy sword. I woke up and he was standing over my head with it unsheathed andhe said, "Who will protect you from me?" I said, "Allah." So he sheathedit and sat down. This is him.'"

(37:151)has <I>ifkuhum</I> and (46:28) has <I>afkahum</I>. He says that it turnedthem from belief and made them liars, as He says, "<I>Averted from it ishe who is averted (ufika)</I>," (51:9), i.e. turned away whoever would beturned away.<P>3910. It is related from 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, about when thepeople of the Lie said what they said about her. (Az-Zuhri said that allof a group related some of her <I>hadith</I> and some remembered more thanothers and confirmed its exact transmission. I memorised from each of themthe <I>hadith</I> which was related to me from 'A'isha and part of the<I>hadith</I> verifies other parts although some of them remembered morethan others. They say that 'A'isha said,)<P>"When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wantedto go on a journey, he drew lots between his wives and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took with him whoever had her lotcame out." 'A'isha said, "Lots were drawn between us for an expedition whichhe went on and my lot came out, so I went out with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. It was after the veil had been sentdown. I was carried in a howdah and was brought down in it.<P>"We travelled until the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, finished that expedition and returned and we drew near to Madina.The announcement was made at night to travel. I got up when they announcedtravel and walked until I had gone past the army. When I finished my need,I went to the camp to leave and then I touched my chest and my necklace madeof onyx had broken. I went back to look for my necklace and looked for itdelayed me."<P>She said, "Those who were carrying me came and picked my howdah and put iton my camel which I was riding. They thought that I was in it. At that timewomen were light and not heavy and did not have a lot of flesh on them. Theyused to eat only a little. So the people did not notice the weight of thehowdah when they lifted it up and carried it as I was a young girl. Theymoved the camel and set off. I found my necklace after the army had left.I came to their site and there was absolutely no one there. I went to theplace where I had been, thinking that they would miss me and return for me.While I was sitting there, drowziness overcame me and I fell asleep. Safwanibn al-Mu'attal as-Sulami, then adh-Dhakwani, was behind the army and hereached my spot at morning. He saw the dark form of someone asleep, so hecame to me. He recognised me when me saw me. He had seen me before the veil.I woke up when he said, 'We belong to Allah and to Him we return!' afterhe had recognised me. I veiled my face with my head-shawl and, by Allah,we did not speak a single word nor did I hear a single word from him exceptfor 'We belong to Allah and to Him we return!' Then he made his camel kneeland he put its leg down and I mounted it. He went leading the camel untilwe reached the army after they had alighted to camp at the height of midday.Then whoever was destroyed was destroyed. The one who led the lie was 'Abdullahibn Ubayy ibn Salul.<P>'Urwa said, "I was told that it was spread and discussed in his presenceand that he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to increaseit." 'Urwa also said, "No one was mentioned as being among the people ofthe Lie except for Hassan ibn Thabit, Mistah ibn Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahshamong some other people about whom I have no knowledge othan than the factthat they formed a group as Allah Almighty said. It is said that the greatestculprit in that was 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul."<P>'Urwa said, "'A'isha disliked for Hassan to be abused in her presence. Sheused to say, 'He is the one who said, "My father and his father and my honourare a protection for the honour of Muhammad against you."'"<P>'A'isha said, "We reached Madina and after I arrived, I was ill there fora month while the people were spreading the word of the people of the liealthough I was not awate of any of that. I imagined in my illness that Idid not see from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, thekindness which I used to see him show when I was ill. He would visit me andgive the greeting and then say, 'How are that one?' Then he would leave.That caused me some doubt, but I was not aware of any of the evil until Irecovered and I went out with Umm Mistah to al-Manasi'. We used to go thelavatory there and we only went out to it from night to night. That was beforewe put up lavatories near our houses."<P>She said, "We followed the custom of the early Arabs of going to the lavatoryin the desert. We found it unpleasant to have lavatories by our houses."She said, "So Umm Mistah bint Abi Ruhm ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib ibn 'Abdu Manaf,whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr ibn 'Amir and the maternal aunt ofAbu Bakr as-Siddiq, and whose son was Mistah ibn Uthatha ibn 'Abbad ibnal-Muttalib and I went out. When we finished our business, Umm Mistah andI were coming towards my house when Umm Mistah tripped on her dress and said,'May Mistah stumble!' I said to her, 'What you have said is bad. Would youcurse a man who was present at Badr?' She said, 'O you there! Have you notheard what he has said?'" She said, "I said, 'And what has he said?' Andshe told be about what the people of the Lie had said."<P>She said, "Then I became even more ill. When I returned to my house, theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came and visitedme and greeted me and then said, 'How is that one?' I said to him, 'Willyou give me permission to go to my parents?'" She said, "I wanted to makesure of the report from them." She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, gave me permission. I asked my mother, 'Mother!What are the people saying?' She said, 'O my daughter! Do not make too muchof the business. By Allah, seldom has there been a woman of beauty with ahusband who loves her with co-wives but that they say a lot against her.'I said, 'Glory be to Allah! The people have been saying this?'" She said,"I spent the entire night until morning unable to stop weeping and couldnot sleep at all. Morning found me still weeping."<P>She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,summoned 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Usama ibn Zayd when the revelation had beendelayed to consult them and ask them about divorcing his wife." She said,"Usama pointed out to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, what he knew of his wife's innocence and what he knew of them.Usama said, '"Keep your wife. We know only good.' 'Ali said, 'Messenger ofAllah, Allah has not constricted you and there are many women besides her.Ask the slavegirl to tell you the truth.'"<P>She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,summoned Barira and said, 'Barira, have you seen anything in her which wouldmake you doubt her?' Barira said to him, 'By the One who sent you with theTruth. I have not seen her do anything for which I could criticise her beyondthe fact that she is a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's leavenso that the sheep comes and eats it.'"<P>She said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,stood up that day and while he was on the minbar asked for help against 'Abdullahibn Ubayy. He said, 'O company of Muslims! Who will help us against a manwhose injury in my family has reached me? By Allah, I only know good of mywife. They mentioned a man about whom I only know good who has not enteredwhere my family is except with me!'"<P>She said, "Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, the brother of 'Abdu'l-Ashhal, got up and said,'Messenger of Allah, by Allah, we will help you against him. If he is fromAws, we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers of Khazraj,command us and we will carry out your command on him.'" She said, "A manof Khazraj got up. Umm Hassan, his cousin, was from his clan-branch. He wasSa'd ibn 'Ubada, the leader of Khazraj. She said, "Before then he had beena virtuous man, but zeal had carried him away, and he said to Sa'd, 'Youlied, by the life of Allah! You will not kill him and you are not able todo that! If he had been from your group, you would not want him to be killed!'Usayd ibn al-Hudayr, the cousin of Sa'd, got up and said to Sa'd ibn 'Ubada,'You have lied, by the life of Allah! We will kill him! You are a hypocritearguing on behalf of hypocrites!'" She said, "The two clans of Aws and Khazrajwere stirred up against one another until they were ready for war while theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standingon the minbar. She said, "The Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, continued to calm them until they were silent and he wassilent." She said, "I wept for that whole day and I could not stop weepingand I could not sleep."<P>"In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights anda day and I could not stop weeping and I could not sleep until I thoughtthat weeping would split my liver. While my parents were sitting with mewhile I was weeping, a woman of the Ansar asked for permission to enter andI gave her permission. She sat down weeping with me. While he were like that,the Messenger of Allah*, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,entered,gave the greeting, and sat down." She said, "He had not sat with me sincebefore the day when what was said about me was said. A month had passed withoutany revelation coming to him regarding my business."<P>She said, "He said the <I>tashahhud</I> when he sat down and then said, ''A'isha,such-and-such about you has reached me. If you are innocent, then Allah willshow you innocent. If you have done any wrong action, then ask forgivenessof Allah and turn to Him in repentance. If the slave of Allah admits hissin and then repents, Allah turns to him.'" She said, "When the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished what he was saying,my tears stopped so that I was not aware of a single tear. I said to my father,'Answer the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,for me regarding what he said.' He said, 'By Allah, I do not know what tosay to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'I said to my mother, 'Answer the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, for me regarding what he said.' She said, 'By Allah,I do not know what to say to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace.'I said, 'I am a young girl who does not recite muchof the Qur'an. By Allah, I know that you have heard this story that peopleare saying and it has become fixed in yourself and you have believed it.If I were to say to you that I am innocent, you would not believe met. IfI were to confess to something to you - and Allah knows that I am innocent- you would believe me. By Allah, I can find no example for you and me exceptfor that of the father of Yusuf when he said, <I>"Steadfast patience isbeautiful. It is Allah alone who is my Help&nbsp;in face of the event thatyou describe."</I> Then I turned over on my bed, Allah knowing that I wasinnocent and hoping that Allah would proclaim me innocent. However, by Allah,I did not think that any revelation would be sent down regarding me. I thoughttoo little of myself that something would be said in the Qur'an regardingme, however I hoped that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, would have a dream in which Allah would exonerate me.<P>"By Allah, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,did not get up from where he was sitting nor did any of the people of theHouse leave before the Revelation descended on him and he and seized by theintense sweating which usually seized him and the sweat was pouring fromhim like pearls of sweat although it was a wintry day because of the weightof the word which descended on him. Then it left the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was smiling. The first wordthat he spoke was that he said to me, ''A'isha, Allah has exonerated you.'She said, "My mother said to me, 'Go to him.' I said, 'No, by Allah! I willnot go to him and I will only praise Allah. the Mighty and Exalted!' ThenAllah Almighty revealed the ten verses, <I>'Those who propagated the lieare a band of you</I>. . .' (24:11)<P>"When Allah sent down this to exonerate me, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, who usedto provide maintenance for Mistah ibn Uthatha because he was related to himand Mistah was poor, said, 'By Allah, I will never provide anything for Mistahever again after what he said about 'A'isha!' Then Allah Almighty sent down,<I>'Those of you possessing affluence and ample wealth should not make oathsthat they will not give to their relatives and the very poor and those whohave emigrated in the way of Allah. They should rather pardon and overlook.Would you not love Allah to forgive you? Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'</I>(24:22) Abu Bakr said, 'Yes, by Allah, I want Allah to forgive me.' Sohe restored to Mistah what he had been giving him. He said, 'By Allah, Iwill never strip him of it!'"<P>'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, also asked Zaynab bint Jahsh about my business. He said to Zaynab,'What do you know? What have you seen?' She said, 'Messenger of Allah, Iprotect my hearing and sight. By Allah, I only know good of her.'" 'A'ishasaid, "She was my rival among the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, but Allah protected her because of her scrupulousness."She said, "Her sister. Hamna began attacking on her behalf and she was destroyedwith those who were destroyed."<P>Ibn Shihab said, "This is what reached me of the story of that group."<P>'Urwa said that 'A'isha said, "By Allah, the man about whom was said whatsaid used to say, 'Glory be to Allah! By the One who has my soul in His hand,I have never even removed the cover of any female!'" She said, "Then afterthat he was killed in the way of Allah."<P>3911. It is related that az-Zuhri said, "Al-Walid ibn 'Abdu'l-Malik said,'Has it reached you that 'Ali was one of those who slandered 'A'isha?' Isaid, 'No, but two men of your people, Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman andAbu Bakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Harith informed me that 'A'isha said tothem that 'Ali was safe concerning her.'" They asked him again but he didnot reply. "Safe" means there was nothing for or against him.<P>3912. It is related that Masruq ibn al-Ajda' said, "Umm Ruman, the motherof 'A&Otilde;isha, said, 'While I was sitting with 'A&Otilde;isha, a womanof the Ansar came in saying, &Ograve;May Allah do such-and-such to a certainperson!"' Umm Ruman asked, "Why?" She replied, "Such-and-such." 'A'isha asked,"Has the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, heardit?" "Yes," she answered. She said, "And Abu Bakr?" She answered, "Yes."She fainted and went she came around, he had a fever and trembling. I puther clothes over her and covered her. The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, came and said, "What is this?" I replied, "Messenger ofAllah, it is fever with trembling." He said, "Perhaps it is on account atale which is being talked about?" I answered, "Yes." 'A'isha sat up andsaid, "If Allah, even if I were to swear to you, you would not believe me.Even I were to say no, you would not excuse me. My example is like that ofYa'qub and his sons. "<I>It is Allah alone who is my Help&nbsp;in face ofthe event that you describe</I>."' She said, 'He left without saying anythingand then Allah sent down her innocence. She said, "Praise belongs to Allah,but no praise to anyone else nor your praise."'"<P>3913. It is related from Ibn Abi Mulayka that 'A'isha used to recite, <I>"Idhtaliq&uuml;nahu bi-alsinatikum" (</I>24:15) and she said that <I>walaq</I>means lying.<P>Ibn Abi Mulayka said, "She knew that better than others since it was sentdown regarding her."<P>3914. It is related from Hisham's father, "I began to abuse Hassan in 'A'isha'spresence and she said, "Do not abuse him. He used to defend the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." 'A'isha said, "Hassanasked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for permissionto satirise the unbelievers. He said, 'What about my lineage?&Otilde; Hassansaid, 'I will remove you from them as one removes the hair from the dough.'"<P>It is related from Hisham's father, "I abused Hassan as he was one of thosewho spoke a lot against her."<P>3915. It is related that Masruq said, "We visited 'A'isha while Hassan ibnThabit was with her reciting some verses of poetry to her. He mentioned someof his <I>ghazal</I> poetry, saying:<BLOCKQUOTE>  'Chaste, honourable, free of suspicion,  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; morning finds her free from having eaten  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the flesh of chaste women.'</BLOCKQUOTE><P>"'A'isha said to him, 'But you are not like that!'" Masruq said, "I askedher, 'Why do you give him permission to visit you when Allah Almighty says,<I>"The one who took it on himself to amplify it will receive a terriblepunishment."</I> (24:11)' She said, 'What punishment is greater than blindness?'She said of him, "He used to defend - or satirise - on behalf of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'"<P><P><B>XXXIII: The expedition of al-Hudaybiyya</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"Allah was pleased with the believers whenthey pledged allegiance to you under the Tree." </I>(48:11)<P>3916. It is related that Zayd ibn Khalid said, "We went out with Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of Hudaybiyyaand it rained on us that night. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, led us in the <I>Subh</I> prayer and then he faced usand said, 'Do you know what your Lord has said?' They said, 'Allah and HisMessenger know best.' He said, 'Allah Almighty said, "This morning My slaveshave become divided up into believers and unbelievers. Those who said, 'Wehad rain by the favour and mercy of Allah,' believe in Me and reject thestars. Those who said that it was because of a certain star, believe in thestar and disbelieve in Me."'"<P>3917. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, made <I>'umra</I> four times, all of which were in Dhu'l-Qa'daexcept the one which was with his <I>hajj</I>: there was the <I>'umra </I>ofal-Hudaybiyya in Dhu'l-Qa'da, the 'umra in the following year in Dhu'l-Qa'da,and the 'umra from al-Ji'rana where he distributed the booty of Hunayn inDhu'l-Qa'da, and the<I> 'umra </I>with his hajj."<P>3918. It is related that Abu Qatada said, "We went with the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of al-Hudaybiya and hisCompanions put on <I>ihram</I> but he did not."<P>3919. It is related that al-Bara' said, "You consider the Conquest to bethe conquest of Makka, and the conquest of Makka was indeed a conquest, butwe considered the Conquest to be the Pledge of Ridwan on the Day of Hudaybiyya.We were fourteen hundred with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace. Al-Hubaybiya was a well. We drew it out until we did not leavea drop in it. That reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and he came and sat on its edge and asked for a vessel of water andrinsed his mouth, prayed and and poured it into the well. We waited a shorttime and then we took out what we and our mounts wished."<P>3920. It is related that al-Bara' said that they numbered fourteen hundredor more on the Day of Hudaybiyya. They camped at a well and drew it dry.They went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and he went and sat on its edge and then said, 'Bring me a bucket of itswater. He was brought it and spat in it and made supplication. Then he said,'Leave it a time.' They quenched themselves and their mounts until they left."<P>3921. It is related that Jabir said, "The people were thirsty on the Dayof Hudaybyiya and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, had a small vessel in front of him and he did wudu'. The people rushedtowards him and he said, 'What is wrong with you?' They said, 'Messengerof Allah, we do not have any water with which to do wudu' or to drink exceptwhat is in front of you.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, placed his hand in the vessel and the water began to bubble betweenhis fingers like fountains. We drank and did <I>wudu</I>'." I said to Jabir,'How many were you?' He said, 'If there had been a hundred thousand, it wouldstill have been enough for us. We were fifteen hundred.'"<P>3922. It is related that Qatada said, "I said to Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, 'Ihave heard that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah says that there were fourteen hundred.'Sa'id said to me, 'Jabir related to me that there were fifteen hundred whogave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, on the Day of Hudaybiya.'"<P>Abu Dawud said that Qurra related it. Muhammad ibn Bashshar corroboratedit as Abu Dawud related it from Shu'ba.<P>3923. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to us on the Day of Hudaybiyya,'You are the best people on the earth.' We were fourteen hundred. If I couldstill see today, I would show you the place of the tree."<P>Al-A'mash corroborated it. He heard Salim who heard Jabir say, "Fourteenhundred."<P>3924. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfasaid, "The people of the treewere thirteen hundred, and Aslam was an eighth of the Ansar.<P>Muhammad ibn Bashshar corroborated it as Abu Dawud related it from Shu'ba.<P>3925. It is related that Mirdas al-Aslami, who was one of those at the Tree,was heard to say, "The righteous will disappear one by one until only thedregs remain like the dregs of barley or dates and Allah will not care aboutthem at all."<P>3926. It is related that Al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and Marwan said, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out from Madina with abouta thousand of his Companions until they came to Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then&nbsp;garlanded his sacrificialanimals and marked it and went into ihram for 'umra."<P>I cannot count how often I heard it was Sufyan until I heard him say, "Ido not remember the marking and garlanding from az-Zuhri, so I do not know,i.e. the location of marking and garlanding, or the entire hadith.<P><A HREF="muw7.html#248">3927</A>. It is related from Ka'b ibn 'Ujra thatthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw himwhen the lice were falling on his face. He asked, "Are your lice troublingyou?" He replied, "Yes." So he commanded him to shave his head while he wasat al-Hudaybiyya and it was not clear to them and they could come out of<I>ihram</I> there and they were still hoping to enter Makka. Then Allahrevealed the <I>fidya</I> and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, commanded him to feed six poor people with one faraqor sacrifice a sheep or fast for three days.<P>3928. It is related that Aslam said, "I went out with 'Umar ibn al-Khattabto the market and a young woman caught up to 'Umar and said, 'Amir al-Mu'minin,my husband has died leaving young children. By Allah, they do not have evena sheep's trotter to cook nor any crops or animals. I fear that that thedrought may destroy them. I am the daughter of Khufaf ibn Ima' al-Ghifariwho was present at al-Hudaybiya with the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace. 'Umar stopped with her and did not continue onwards. Thenhe said, 'Welcome to a close relative.' Then he went to a strong camel whichwas tied in the house and loaded on to it two bags full of food. Betweenthem he placed money and clothes and then he gave her its halter and said,'Lead it. It will not finish until Allah gives you good.' A man said, 'Amiral-Mu'minin, you have given her too much!' 'Umar said, 'May your mother bebereft of you! By Allah, I saw the father and brother of this woman layingsiege to a fortress for a time and then conquering it and then we discussedwhat their full shares of it should be."<P>3929. It is related that the father of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "I sawthe Tree and then I came to it later and could not recognise it."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that Mahmud said, "Then I later forgot it."<P>3930. It is related that Tariq ibn 'Abdullah said, "I went out on hajj andpassed by some people who were praying. I asked, 'What is this mosque?' Theyreplied, "This is the Tree where the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, received the allegiance in the Pledge of Farewell.'I went to Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab and informed him. Sa'id said, 'My fatherinformed me that he was among those who gave allegiance to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, under the tree. He said,"When we went out the following year, we had forgotten it and could not findit."' So Sa'id said, 'If the Companions of Muhammad did not know it and thenyou know it, do you then know better?'"<P>3931. It is related that the father of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said, "We wereamong those who gave allegiance under the Tree. Then we returned to it thefollowing year and it was hidden from us."<P>3932. It is related that Tariq said, "The tree was mentioned in the presenceof Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab and he laughed and said, 'My father informed meand he was present at it."'<P>3933. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa, who was one of the peopleof the Tree, was heard to say, "When people came to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, with their <I>zakat</I>, he would say, 'OAllah, bless the family of so-and-so.' My father took his <I>zakat</I> tohim and said, 'O Allah, bless the family of Abi Awfa.'"<P>[<I>Sadaqa</I> is used with the meaning of <I>zakat</I>.]<P>3934. It is related that 'Abbad ibn Tamim said, "On the Day of the Battleof al-Harra when the people were giving allegiance to 'Abdullah ibn Hanzala,Ibn Zayd asked, 'On what basis is Ibn Hanzala taking the people's allegiance?'He was tols, 'To death.' He said, 'I will not give allegiance to anyone forthat after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.'He had been present with him at al-Hudaybiyya."<P>3935. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa', who was one of the people ofthe Tree, said, "We used to pray Jumu'a with the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and then leave. The walls had no shade which wecould use."<P>3936. It is related that Yazid ibn Abi "Ubayd said, "I asked Salama ibn al-Akwa','On what basis did you give allegiance to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, on the Day of al-Hudaybiyya?' He replied,'To death.'"<P>3937. It is related that al-Musayyab said, "I met al-Bara' ibn 'Azib andsaid, 'May you have good! You kept the company of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and gave allegiance to him under the Tree!'He said, 'O nephew! You do not know what we have done after him!'"<P>3938. It is related from Abu Qilaba that Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak informed himthat he gave allegiance to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, under the Tree.<P>3939. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that <I>"Truly We have granted youa manifest victory" </I>(48:1) is al-Hudaybiyya. His Companions said, "Delightfulcongratulations! But what do we have?" So Allah sent down, <I>"That He mightadmit the believing men and women into Gardens with rivers flowing underthem." </I>(48:5)<P>Shu'ba said, "I came to Kufa and related all of it from Qatada and then Ireturned and mentioned it. He said, "The '<I>Truly We have granted you amanifest victory</I>' is from Anas and 'Delightful congratulations!' is from'Ikrima.<P>3940. It is related that Zahir al-Aslami, who was one of those who was presentat the Tree, said, 'I was kindling the fire under the pots with the donkeymeat when the announcer of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, announced, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, has forbidden you donkey flesh.'"<P>It is related from a man of them who was one of the people of the Tree, namedUhban ibn Aws, who had something wrong with his knee and when he prostrated,he used to put a cushion under his knee.<P>3941. It is related from Suwayd ibn an-Nu'man, who was one of the peopleof the Tree, that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and his Companions were given <I>sawiq</I> and chewed it.<P>Mu'adh corroborated it from Shu'ba.<P>3942. It is related that Abu Jamra said, "I asked 'A'idh ibn 'Amr, who wasone of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,who was people of the Tree, 'Can the <I>witr</I> be undone [i.e. repeated]?'He said, 'When you do the <I>witr</I> at the beginning of the night, thenyou do not do the <I>witr</I> at the end of it.'"<P><A HREF="muw4.html#9">3943</A>. It is related from Zayd ibn Aslam from hisfather that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was travelling at night on one of his journeys and 'Umar ibn al-Khattab wastravelling with him. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab asked him about something and hedid not answer. Then he asked him again and he did not answer. Then he askedhim yet again and he did not answer. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "May yourmother be bereft of you, 'Umar! You have pressed the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, three times and each time he hasnot answered you.'" 'Umar said, 'I spurred my camel on and then went aheadof the Muslims, fearing that some Qur'an would be sent down about me. Itwas not long before I heard someone shouting for me." He said, "I said, 'Iwas afraid that some Qur'an might be sent down about me!' I went to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and greeted him and hesaid, 'Tonight a <I>sura</I> has been sent down on me which I love more thanthat on which the sun rises. Then he recited, "<I>Truly We have granted youa manifest victory</I>." (48:1)'"<P>3944. It is related from al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and Marwan, the <I>hadith</I>of each supporting the other's, who said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, went out in the year of al-Hudaybiyya with abut onethousand of his Companions. When he reached Dhu'l-Hulayfa, he garlanded thesacrificial animals and marked them, and assumed ihram for 'umra. He sentout a spy from Khuza'a. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,travelled until he was at Ghadir al-Ashtat when his spy came to him and said,'Quraysh have gathered forces against you and they have gathered the Abyssiniansagainst you. They will fight you and bar you from the House and stop you.'He said, 'O people! Tell me what you think. Do you think that I should attackthe their families and the offspring of those who desire to bar us from theHouse? If they come to us, Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, has cut off a spyfrom the idolaters. Otherwise, we will leave them bereft.' Abu Bakr said,'O Messenger of Allah, you set out aiming for this House without any desireto fight anyone or to make war on anyone. Make for it and we will fight whoeverbars us from it.' He said, 'Proceed in the name of Allah!'"<P>3945. Part of what 'Urwa reported from Marwan ibn al-Hakam and al-Miswaribn Makhrama, reporting about what happened with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the 'umra of al-Hudaybiyya, "Whenthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,wrote thetreaty of truce with Suhayl ibn 'Amr on the Day of al-Hudaybiya, one of thepreconditions of that Suhayl ibn 'Amr made was that he said, 'On the conditionthat if any of us comes to you, even if he has your religion, you will returnhim to us and you will not come between us and him.' Suhayl refused to concludethe truce with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, except on that basis. The believers disliked that and were grievedby it and spoke against it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, signed it and then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, returned Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl on that very dayto his father, Suhayl ibn 'Amr, When any man came to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he returned him in that period,even if he was a Muslim. Believing emigrant women came. and Umm Kulthum bint'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt was one of those who went to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Se was a young woman. Her familycame to ask the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,to return her when Allah Almighty sent down what He sent down about believingwomen."<P>[i.e. 60:12]<P>3946. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to examine believingwomen who emigrated by this <I>ayat</I>,<I> 'O Prophet! When believing womencome to you pledging allegiance to you...' </I>(60:12)"<P>'Urwa's uncle said, "It reached us that when Allah commanded His Messengerto return to the idolaters what they had spent on their wives who had emigrated,and we were informed that when Abu Basir came..." and he mentioned it infull.<P>3947. It is related from Nafi' that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar went out to make'umra during the sedition and he said, "If I am barred from the House, wewill do as we did with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace." He assumed <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I> because the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had assumed <I>ihram</I>for <I>'umra </I>in the Year of al-Hudaybiyya.<P>3948. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar put on <I>ihram</I> and said,"If something intervenes between me and it, I will do as the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, did when the unbelievers of Qurayshcame between him and it." Then he recited, <I>"You have an excellent modelin the Messenger of Allah." </I>(33:21)<P><A HREF="muw7.html#100">3949</A>. It is related from Nafi' that 'Ubaydullahibn 'Abdullah and Salim ibn 'Abdullah reported that they spoke to 'Abdullahibn 'Umar.<P>It is related from Nafi' that one of 'Abdullah's sons said to him, "If onlyyou would stay home this year. I fear that you will not reach the House."He answered, "We went out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, when the unbelievers of Quraysh were between him andthe House. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sacrificedhis sacrificial animals and shaved his head and his Companions cut theirhair short." He said, "I testify to you that I went into <I>ihram</I> todo<I> 'umra</I>. If the way is clear between me and the House, I will do<I>tawaf</I>. If something comes between me and it, I will do as the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did." Then he travelledfor a time and then said, "I only think that they are the same. I testifyto you that I have gone into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>and hajj." Sohe only did one <I>tawaf</I> and one <I>sa'y </I>and came out of <I>ihram</I>for both of them.<P>3950. It is related that Nafi' said, "People were saying that Ibn 'Umar becameMuslim before 'Umar, but that was not the case. On the Day of al-Hudaybiyya,'Umar sent 'Abdullah for a horse which a man of the Ansar had to fetch itfor him to fight on. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was receiving allegiance under the Tree, but 'Umar was not awareof that. 'Abdullah gave him allegiance and then went to the horse and broughtit to 'Umar. 'Umar was dressing for battle and he informed him that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was receiving allegianceunder the Tree." He said, "He went and 'Abdullah went with him until he gaveallegiance to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.This is what the people were talking about when they said that Ibn 'Umarhad become Muslim before 'Umar."<P>3951. It is related from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar that the people were with theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyaand they had separated into the shade of the trees. Then suddenly the peoplewere around the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,looking at him. He said, "'Abdullah, see why the people are around the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looking at him," He foundthat they were giving allegiance, so he gave allegiance and then returnedto 'Umar who then went out and gave allegiance.<P>3952. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa said, "We were with the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he went on <I>'umra</I>. Hedid <I>tawaf</I> of the House and we did <I>tawaf</I> with him, he prayedand we prayed with him. He ran between Safa and Marwa and we were shieldinghim from the people of Makka so that no one would harm him."<P>3953. It is related that Abu Wa'il said, "When Sahl ibn Hunayf came fromthe Battle of Siffin, we went to ask about him. He said, 'You should suspectyour opinions! I saw myself on the day when Abu Jandal came! If I had beenable to defy the order of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, I would have defied it, but Allah and His Messenger knew best. Wedid not put our swords on our shoulders in the case of something which outragedus but that our swords made it easier for us to reach something we agreedto before this business. Whenever we mend one side, a breach opens on theother side and we do not know what to do about it.'"<P>3954. It is related that Ka'b ibn 'Ujra said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, came to me in the time of al-Hudaybiyya while thelice were falling onto my face. He said, 'Are your lice troubling you?' Isaid, 'Yes.' He said, 'Shave your head and fast for three days or feed poorpeople or sacrifice a sheep.'" Ayyub said, "I do not know with which of themhe started."<P>3955. It is related that Ka'b ibn 'Ujra said, "We with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at al-Hudaybiyya and we were in<I>ihram</I> and the idolaters had prevented us from continuing." He said,"I had abundant hair and the lice were falling onto my face. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, passed by me and said, 'Are yourlice troubling you?' I replied, 'Yes.'" He said, "This verse was sent down:<I>'If any of you are ill or have a head injury, the expiation is fastingor sadaqa or sacrifice.' </I>(2:195)"<P><P><B>XXXIV: The story of 'Ukl and 'Uyayna</B><P>3956. It is related from Anas that some people of 'Ukl and 'Uyayna came toMadina to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and theyprofessed Islam. They said, "O Prophet of Allah! We are herdsmen and we arefarmers." They found Madina unwholesome and so the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, commanded some milk camels and a herdsmanfor them. He told them to go out with the camels and to drink their milkand urine. They went until they were in the region of al-Harra where theyrecanted their Islam and murdered the herdsman of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and stole the milk camels. The news of thisreached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he sentout people after them. He commanded that nails be driven into their eyesand their hands and feet cut off and they were left in the al-Harra regionuntil they died in that condition."<P>Qatada said, "It reached us that after that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, encouraged sadaqa and forbade mutilation."<P>Qatada said, "From 'Urayna."<P>Anas said, "Some people came from 'Ukl."<P>3957. It is related from Abu Raja', the client of Abu Qilaba who was withhim in Syria that one day 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz consulted the people, asking,"What do you say about this oath-taking (<I>qas&acirc;ma</I>)?" They said,"It is a right which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and the khalifs before you carried out." He said, "Abu Qilabawas behind his seat when 'Anbasa ibn Sa'id asked, 'Where is the <I>hadith</I>of Anas regarding the people of 'Urayna?' Abu Qilaba said, 'Anas ibn Malikrelated it to me.'"<P>Anas said, "From 'Urayna," and Abu Qilaba said from Anas, "From 'Ukl," andhe mentioned the story.<P><P><B>XXXV: The expedition of Dhat al-Qarad</B><P>It is the raid which was launched against the milk-camels of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, three days after Khaybar.<P>3958. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "I went out before thefirst <I>adhan</I> and the milk camels of the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, were being herded at Dhat al-Qarad." He said,"A a slave of 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf met me and said, 'The milk camels ofthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, have beentaken.' I asked, 'Who took them?' He said, 'Ghatafan and Fazara.' I gavethree shouts: 'O companions!' so that I made whatever is between the twolava fields of Madina hear me. Then I rushed ahead until I caught up to themwhile they were watering the camels. As I was an archer, I began to shootmy arrows at them, saying:<BLOCKQUOTE>  "'I am the son of al-Akwa'  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; and today is a day when the blameworthy perish!'</BLOCKQUOTE><P>"I kept on chanting metric words until I rescued the milk camels from themand I also seized thirty cloaks from them." He said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and the people came and I said, 'O Prophetof Allah. I have kept the people from the water and they are thirsty. Sendafter them straightaway.' He said, 'O son of al-Akwa'! You have been givenpower, so be kind.'" He said, "Then we returned and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, let me ride behind him on his she-cameluntil we entered Madina."<P><P><B>XXXVI: The expedition of Khaybar</B><P>3959. It is related from Suwayd ibn al-Nu'man that he went out with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of Khaybar.They travelled until they reached as-Sahba', which is near Khaybar. "TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed <I>'Asr </I>andthen asked for food. Only <I>sawiq</I> was brought. He ordered that it bemoistened. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,ate and we ate as well. Then he got up for <I>Maghrib</I> and rinsed hismouth out and we also rinsed out our mouths. Then he prayed without repeatingwudu'."<P>3960. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "We went out with theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to Khaybar and we travelledby night. A man among the people said to 'Amir, 'O 'Amir! Won't you let ushear a little of your verses?' 'Amir was a man who was a poet and camel-chanter.He began to chant in time with the camels of the people, saying:<BLOCKQUOTE>  'O Allah, were it not for You, we would not have been guided  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; nor given <I>sadaqa</I> nor prayed!  <P>  So forgive as ransom what we have not done,  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; and send down tranquillity on us.  <P>  Make our feet firm when we meet the enemy,  <P>  &nbsp; &nbsp; but we refuse if they desire to tempt us.  <P>  They have bayed out for help against us!'</BLOCKQUOTE><P>"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked,'Who is this driver?' They said, ''Amir ibn al-Akwa'.' He said, 'May Allahhave mercy on him!' A man among the people said, 'It [i.e. martydrom] ismandatory, Prophet of Allah! Would that you let us enjoy him longer!' Sowe came to Khaybar and besieged them until we were afflicted by terriblehunger. Then Allah Almighty gave us the conquest of it over them. In theevening of the day on which they conquered them, the people kindled severalfires. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, 'Whatare these fires? For what are they being kindled?' They replied, 'For meat.'He asked, 'For what meat?' They said, 'For (cooking) domestic donkeys.' TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Pour them out andbreak them.' A man said, 'O Messenger of Allah! Or can we pour them out andwash them?' He said, 'Or that.'<P>"When the people were formed in battle lines, 'Amir's sword was short andhe went to strike the leg of a Jew and the edge of his sword came back andstruck 'Amir's own knee and he died from it. " He said, "When they returnedhome, Salama said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,sawme and took hold of my hand and said, "What is the matter with you?" I saidto him, "May my father and my mother be your ransom! They claim that 'Amir'sactions are lost!" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, "Whoever said that has lied. He has a double reward." He put two ofhis fingers together and said, "He is a striving striver. Few Arabs haveachieved the like of him!"'"<P>Hatim said, "He grew up with it."<P>3961. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, came to Khaybar at night. When he came to a peopleat night, he would not attack them until morning. In the morning, the Jewscame out carrying their spades and buckets. When they saw him, they said,'Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad and the army!' The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, saw them, he said, 'Khaybar is destroyed. When wealight in the yard of a people, it is a bad morning indeed for those whohave been warned.'"<P>3962. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We reached Khaybar in theearly morning and its people came out with spades. When they saw the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they exclaimed, 'Muhammad! By Allah,Muhammad and the army!' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Allah is greater! Khaybar is destroyed. When we alight in the yardof a people, it is a bad morning indeed for those who have been warned.'We got some donkey meat and then the announcer of the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, announced, 'Allah and His Messengerhave forbidden you donkey meat. It is unclean.'"<P>3963. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said that somone came to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, "Donkeys havebeen eaten." He was silent. Then he came to him a second time and said, "Donkeyshave been eaten." He was silent. Then he came to him a third time and said,"Donkeys have been eaten." Then he commanded an announcer to announce amongthe people, "Allah and His Messenger have forbidden you the meat of domesticdonkeys." So the pots were upset while the meat was boiling in them.<P>3964. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, prayed <I>Subh</I> near Khaybar when it was dark. Then hesaid, 'Allah is greater! Khaybar is destroyed. When we alight in the yardof a people, it is a bad morning indeed for those who have been warned.'They came out running in the roads. The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, killed the fighters and took the women and children captive.Safiyya was among the captives and she went to Dihya al-Kalbi and then shewent to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He made herbride-price her emancipation,"<P>'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn Suhayb said to Thabit, "Abu Muhammad, did you say to Anas,'What was her bride-price?' Thabit nodded his head to confirm it.'"<P>3965. It is related that 'Abdu'-l'Aziz ibn Suhayb said, "I heard Anas ibnMalik say, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took Safiyyacaptive and set her free and then married her.' Thabit asked Anas, 'Whatwas her bride-price?' He said, 'Her bride-price was herself. He freed her.'"<P>3966. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi is that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the idolaters met andfought. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,returned to his camp, the others returned to their camp. A man among theCompanions of the Messenger of Allah who would follow any of them who wasseparate or alone and strike him with his sword. It was said, "Today noneof us has given satisfaction as so-and-so has!" The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "He is one of the people of theFire." A man of the people said, "I will accompany him." He said, "He wentout with him and stopped whenever he stopped and hurried with him wheneverhe hurried." He said, "The man received a severe wound and hastened his deathby placing the hilt of his sword in the earth and its point at his breastand then fell on his sword and killed himself. The man went to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I testify thatyou are the Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'What is it?' He said, 'Regardingthe man you mentioned before as being one of the people of the Fire, whichpeople thought terrible, I said, "I will go out to follow him." I went outafter him. Then he received a severe wound and he hastened his death by placingthe hilt on his sword in the earth and point at his breast and then he fellon it and killed himself.' At that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'A man can do the actions of the people ofthe Garden in what he shows to people, while he is one of the people of theFire, and a man can do the actions of the people of the Fire in what he showsto people, while he is one of the people of the Garden.'"<P>3967. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "We were present at Khaybar andthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said abouta man with him who claimed to be a Muslim, 'This is one of the people ofthe Fire.' When the fighting occurred, the man fought fiercely and receivedseveral wounds. Some people nearly doubted. The man felt the pain of thewound and put his hand in his quiver and removed an arrow from it, and killedhimself with it. Some of the Muslim men dashed up and said, 'Messenger ofAllah. Allah has confirmed what you said, So-and-so committed suicide andkilled himself!' He said, 'So-and-so, get up and announce that only a believerwill enter the Garden, and Allah might support this <I>deen</I> with an impiousman.'"<P>Ma'mar corroborated it from az-Zuhri.<P>It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "We were present with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at Khaybar."<P>It is related from Sa'id from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>Salih corroborated it from az-Zuhri.<P>It is related that 'Ubaydullah ibn Ka'b said, "Someone who was present withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at Khaybar relatedto me."<P>It is related from 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah and Sa'id from the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>3968. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "When the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, attacked Khaybar (or he said,'When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, madefor Khaybar,") and the people were overlooking a valley, they would raisetheir voices with the <I>takbir</I>, 'Allah is greater! Allah is greater!There is no god but Allah!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'Be kind to yourselves! You are not calling someonewho is deaf or absent. You are calling on One who is hearing, near. He iswith you.' I was riding behing the animal of the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and he heard me saying, 'There is nopower nor strength except by Allah,' and he said to me, 'O 'Abdullah ibnQays!' I said, 'At your service, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Shall I directyou to a word which is one of the treasures of the Garden?' I said, 'Yes,indeed, Messenger of Allah, may my mother and father be your ransom!' Hesaid, 'There is no power nor strength except by Allah.'"<P>3969. It is related that Yazid ibn Abi 'Ubayd said, "I saw the scar of awound on Salama's leg and I asked, 'O Abu Muslim! What is this wound?' Hereplied, 'This is a wound which I received on the Day of Khaybar. Peoplesaid, "Salama has been wounded!" I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, and he spat on it three times and I have had no complaintfrom it until now.'"<P>3970. It is related that Sahl said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, and the idolaters met in one of his expeditions and fought.Then each peopke retired to their camps. Among the Muslims was a man whowould follow any of them who was separate or alone and strike him with hissword. It was said, 'Messenger of Allah, no one has given satisfaction asso-and-so has!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'He is one of the people of the Fire.' They said, 'Which ofus will be among the people of the Garden if this man is among the peopleof the Fire?' A man of the people said, 'I will follow him. I will be withhim whether he goes fast or slow.' When he was wounded, he hastened his deathby placing the hilt of his sword in the earth and its point at his breastand then fell on his sword and killed himself. The man went to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'I testify thatyou are the Messenger of Allah.' He asked, 'What is it?' and he told him.He said, 'A man can do the actions of the people of the Garden in what heshows to people, while he is one of the people of the Fire, and he can dothe actions of the people of the Fire in what he shows to people, while heis one of the people of the Garden.'"<P>3971. It is related that Abu 'Imran said, "Anas looked at the people on<I>Jumu'a </I>and saw head shawls and said, 'They look at this moment likethe Jews of Khaybar.'"<P>3972. It is related that Salama said, "Ali ibn Abi Talib stayed behind theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, during Khaybar becausehe had an eye-complaint. He said, 'Can I stay behind the Prophet!' and hejoined him. On the evening of the night before the morning when Khaybar wasconquered, the Prophet said, 'I will give the banner - or it will be taken- tomorrow to a man whom Allah and his Messenger love, and Allah will givehim victory.' We were hoping for it and it was said, 'This is 'Ali!' andhe gave it to him, and Allah gave him victory."<P>3973. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd reported that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said on the Day of Khaybar, "I will give thebanner to a man at whose hands Allah will conquer. He loves Allah and HisMessenger, and Allah and His Messenger love him." He said, "The people spentthe night wondering to whom it would be given, and in the morning all thepeople went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, all of them hoping to be given it. He asked, 'Where is 'Ali ibn 'AbiTalib?' He was told, 'He has something wrong with his eyes, Messenger ofAllah.' He said, 'Send for him.' He was brought and the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, spat in his eyes and made supplicationfor him, and it was healed as if there had not been anything wrong with it.He gave him the banner and 'Ali said, 'Messenger of Allah, shall I will fightthem until they are like us?' He said, 'Take it easy until you arrive intheir quarter and then invite them to Islam and tell them what Allah hasmade incumbent for them. By Allah, that one man be guided by you is betterfor you than having than red camels.'"<P>3974. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We reached Khaybar and whenAllah let him conquer the fortress, the beauty of Safiyya bint Huyayy ibnAkhtab was mentioned to him. Her husband had been killed and she was stilla bride. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,chose her for himself and went with her until we reached Sadd ar-Sahba' whereshe became lawful and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, went to her in marriage. Then some <I>hays</I> was put on a smallleather mat. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said to me, 'Announce it to those around you.' That was his marriage-feastfor Safiyya. Then we left for Madina. I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, wrapping her in his cloak behind him. Thenhe sat beside his camel and put his knee up and Safiyya put her foot on hisknee to mount."<P>3975. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;spent three days with Safiyyabint Huyayy on the Khaybar road where he married her. She was one of thosefor whom the veil was ordered."<P>3976. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, remained between Khaybar and Madinafor three nights when he married Safiyya. I invited the Muslims to his weddingfeast. There was no bread or meat in it, but he only commanded Bilal to spreadout a leather mat on which was placed some dates, dried yoghurt and ghee.The Muslims asked, 'Is she one of the Mothers of the Believers or his slave[lit. what his right hand owns]?' They said, 'If he veils her, then she isone of the Mothers of the Believers. If he does not veil her, then she ispart of his property.' When he travelled, he made a place for her behindhim and extended the veil."<P>3977. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal said, "While we were layingsiege to the fortress of Khaybar, someone threw a leather bag contained gheeand I rushed to get it. I turned and there was the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and I was embarrassed before him."<P>3978. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that on the Day of Khaybar the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade eating garlicand the flesh of domestic donkeys.<P>The report that&nbsp;he forbade eating garlic is only from Nafi' while theflesh of domestic monkeys is related from Salim.<P><A HREF="muw9.html#m41">3979</A>. It is related from 'Ali ibn Abi Talib thatthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadethe mut'a (temporary marriage) with women on the Day of Khaybar and eatingthe flesh of domestic donkeys.<P>3980. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "On the Day of Khaybar the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade eating the flesh of domesticdonkeys."<P>3981. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, forbade eating the flesh of domestic donkeys."<P>3982. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "On the Day of Khaybarthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade eating theflesh of domestic donkeys, but allowed horse-meat."<P>3983. It is related that Ibn Abi Awfa said, "We were afflicted by severehunger on the Day of Khaybar. When the pots were boiling," and he said, "someof it was cooked, the announcer of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, came, 'Do not eat any of the flesh of the donkeys. Pour it out.'"Ibn Abi Awfa said, "It was related to us that he had forbidden it becauseof the <I>khumus</I> had not been taken from it, but some of them said thathe forbade it absolutely because they used to eat filth."<P>3984. It is related from al-Bara' and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa and they werewith the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and got some donkeysand cooked them. Then the announcer of the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, announced, "Overturn the pots."<P>3985. It is related that al-Bara' and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa related thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said on the Khaybarwhen the pots had been set up, "Overturn the pots."<P>It is related that al-Bara' said, "We raided with the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace," and the like.<P>3986. It is related that al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, commanded us during the Khayar expeditionto throw away the meat of domestic donkeys, raw and cooked, and he did notcommand us to eat it later."<P>3987. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I do not know why the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade it because theywere beasts of burden for the people and so disliked for their carriers tobe removed, or he made the flesh of domestic donkeys unlawful on the Dayof Khaybar."<P>3988. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "On the Day of Khaybar the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the horse two sharesand the man on foot one share." Nafi' explained it and said, "If a man hada horse, he got three shares and if he did not have a horse, he got one share."<P>3989. It is related that Jubayr ibn Mut'im said, "I and 'Uthman ibn 'Affanwent to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and we said, 'You have given to the Banu'l-Muttalib from the <I>khumus</I>of Khaybar and left us out although we have the same position with you.'He said, 'The Banu'l-Muttalib and the Banu Hashim are the same thing.'" Jubayrsaid, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not distributeanything to the Banu 'Abdu Shams nor the Banu Nawfal."<P>3990. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The fact that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;had departed reached us while we werein the Yemen. So we set out to emigrate to him - me and two of my brothers,and I was the youngest of them. One of them was Abu Burda and the other wasAbu Ruhm. (He said either, "We were some," or "We were fifty-three or fifty-two)men of our people. We embarked on a boat and out boat took us to the Negusin Abyssinia. We found Ja'far ibn Abi Talib. We stayed with him until weall went and found the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,whenhe had conquered Khaybar.<P>"Some of the people used to say to us, i.e. the people of the ship, 'We emigratedbefore you. Asma' bint 'Umays, who was one of those who arrived with us,visited Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace. She had emigrated to the Negus with those who emigrated. 'Umar camein to Hafsa while Asma' was with her." He said, "When 'Umar saw Asma', heasked, 'Who is this?' She said, "Asma' bint 'Umays.' 'Umar asked, 'Is thisthe Abyssinian? The seafarer?' Asma' replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'We emigratedbefore you so we are more entitled to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, than you.' She got angry and said, 'No, by Allah!While you were with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, who was feeding those of you who were hungry and admonishing thoseof you who were ignorant, we were in an abode - or a land - which was farand hated the <I>deen</I>, in Abyssinia, and that was for the sake of Allahand His Messenger. By Allah, I will not eat any food nor drink anything untilI mention what you have said to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace! We were being abused and made to fear. I will mentionthat to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I willask him! By Allah, I will not lie nor deviate nor add anything to it!' Whenthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came, she said, 'OProphet of Allah! 'Umar said such-and-such.' He asked, 'And what did yousay to him?' She replied, 'I said such-and-such to him.' He said, 'He isnot more entitled to me than you. He and his companions have one emigrationwhile you - the people of the ship - have two emigrations.' She said, 'Isaw Abu Musa and the people of ship coming to me in successive groups toask me about this <I>hadith</I>, and there was nothing in the world whichdelighted them more or what was more important to them that what the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to them.'"<P>Abu Burda said, "Asma' said, 'I saw Abu Musa when he was asking me to repeatthis <I>hadith</I>.'"<P>3991. It is related that Abu Musa said that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "I recognise the voices of the group ofal-Ash'arites with the Qur'an when they go into their homes at night, andI recognise their houses from their voices chanting the Qur'an at night,even if I have not seen they houses when they went into them in the day.One of them is Hakim who, when he met the cavalry (or he said, "the enemy"),said to them, 'My companions order you to wait for them.'"<P>3992. It is related that Abu Musa said, "We came to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, after he had conquered Khaybar and he gaveus a share and he did not give a share to anyone who was not present at Khaybarexcept for us."<P>3993. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "We conquered Khaybar and didnot take as booty either gold nor silver. We took cattle, camels, goods andgardens. Then we went with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, to Wadi al-Qura. He had with him a slave of his called Mid'amwhom one of the Banu'd-Dibbab. While he was removing the saddle of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a stray arrow came andhit that slave. The people said, 'Welcome to martyrdom for him!' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Rather, by theOne who has my soul in His hand, the cloak which he took from the booty onthe Day of Khaybar before the distribution has been kindled into fire onhim.' Then a man who had heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, say that brought one or two straps and said, 'This is somethingI took.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'One - or two - straps of fire.'"<P>3994. It is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "By the One in whosehand my soul is, were it not that I I might leave other Muslims poor withoutnothing, I would have distributed every village I conquered among its peopleas the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, distributed Khaybar,but I leave it as a treasury which they can distribute."<P>3995. It is related that 'Umar said, "If it were not for other Muslims, Iwould have distributed every village I conquered among its people as theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, distributed Khaybar."<P>3996. It is related that Abu Hurayra went to the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and asked him [for a share]. One of the sons ofSa'id ibn al-'As said, "Do not give it to him!" Abu Hurayra said, "This isthe murderer of Ibn Qawqal!' He said, "How strange! A desert weasel? slipsdown from Qadum Da'n!"<P>It is related that Abu Hurayra reported to Sa'd ibn al-'As, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent Aban on a raid fromMadina in the direction of Najd." Abu Hurayra said, "Aban and his companionscame to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at Khaybar afterhe had conquered it, and the reins of their horses were made of palm fibre."Abu Hurayra said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, do not give them a share!'Aban said, 'You say this, you desert weasel, coming down from the top ofDa'n?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Aban!Sit down!' and he did not give them a share."<P>3997. It is related from Sa'id that Aban ibn Sa'id came to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and greeted him. Abu Hurayra said, 'OMessenger of Allah! This is the murderer of Ibn Qawqal!" Aban said to AbuHurayra, "How strange you are! A desert weasel?slips down to us from QadumDa'n, blaming me for killing someone man whom Allah has honoured at my handsand whom He forbade to disgrace me at his hands."<P>3998. It is related from 'A'isha that Fatima, peace be upon her, the daughterof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent to Abu Bakrto ask for her share of the inheritance from what the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left of the spoils in Madina andFadak which Allah had given him, and what was left of the <I>khumus</I> ofKhaybar. Abu Bakr said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'We do not bequeath inheritance. What we leave is<I>sadaqa</I>. The family of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, eat from this property.' I will not alter anything of the<I>sadaqa</I> of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, from the state which it had in the time of the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I will only act in it as theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, acted." So AbuBakr refused to give Fatima any of it. Therefore Fatima got angry with AbuBakr on that account and dissociated herself from him and did not speak tohim until she died. She lived for six months after the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace. When she died, her husband 'Ali buried herat night and did not inform Abu Bakr, and prayed over her.<P>While Fatima was alive, people had esteem for 'Ali, but when she died, 'Alinoticed a change indicating dislike in people's faces. Therefore he soughta reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him his allegiance, and he had notgiven allegiance during those months. 'Ali sent to Abu Bakr, "Come to usand do not let anyone come with you," disliking for 'Umar to be present.'Umar said, "No, by Allah, you will not go into them alone!" Abu Bakr said,"What do you think that they do to me? By Allah, I will go them!"<P>So Abu Bakr went in to them and 'Ali said the <I>shahada</I> and then said,"We acknowledge your excellence and what Allah has given you and we do notenvy you the good which Allah has caused to come to you, but you actedindependently of us in the business and we thought that we had a portionin it because of our closeness to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace." So Abu Bakr's eyes filled with tears. When AbuBakr spoke, he said, "By the One who has my soul in His hand! I prefer tomaintain my ties with the relatives of the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, than to maintain ties with my own relatives.As for the conflict which arose between you and me about these properties,I will not be remiss in seeing that good is done in it and I will not abandonanything which I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace,&nbsp;do with them, without doing it." Then 'Ali said to Abu Bakr,"I promise you that I will give allegiance in the afternoon." When Abe Bakrhad prayed <I>Dhuhr</I>, he went up the minbar and said the <I>tashahhud</I>and mentioned the business of 'Ali and how he had refrained from givingallegiance and excused him for the excuses he had made. Then 'Ali asked forforgiveness and said the <I>tashahhud</I> and esteemed Abu Bakr's right andsaid that he had not been moved to what he did on account of any jealousytowards Abu Bakr nor any aversion to the preference which Allah had bestowedon him, "but we used to consider that we had a portion in this business andhe acted independently of us and we felt aggrieved in ourselves." The Muslimswere happy about that and said, "You have done the right thing." The Muslimswere friendly to 'Ali when he returned the correct business."<P>3999. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When Khaybar was conquered, we said,'Now we will have our fill of dates.'"<P>4000. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "We have had our fill of dates sincewe conquered Khaybar."<P><P><B>XXXVII: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, appointingsomeone as agent for the people of Khaybar</B><P>4001. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Abu Hurayra that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, appointed a man as anagent in Khaybar who brought him some dates of a really excellent kind. TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, "Areall the dates of Khaybar like this?" He replied, "No, by Allah, Messengerof Allah. We take one <I>sa' </I>of this kind for two <I>sa's</I> and two<I>sa's</I> for three <I>sa's</I>." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Do not do that. Sell the worse ones for dirhamsand then buy the good ones with those dirhams."<P>It is related from Abu Sa'id and Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;sent a brother of the Banu 'Adi fromthe Ansar to Khaybar and put him in charge of it.<P>The like of it is related from Abu Sa'id and Abu Hurayra.<P><P><B>XXXVIII: How the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, dealtwith the people of Khaybar</B><P>4002. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, rented Khaybar to the Jews to work it and cultivateit on the basis that they would have half of what it produced."<P><P><B>XXXIX: The sheep which was poisoned and given to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, at Khaybar</B><P>'Urwa transmitted it from 'A'isha from the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace.<P>4003. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When Khaybar was conquered, apoisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace."<P><P><B>XL: The expedition of Zayd ibn Haritha</B><P>4004. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, put Usama ibn Zayd in command over some people.Some people disparaged his being in command and the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'If you disparage him being in command, youalso disaparaged the leadership of his father before. By Allah, he was worthyof command and he was one of the most beloved of people to me, and this isone of the most beloved of people to me after him.'"<P><P><B>XLI: The Fulfilled 'Umra ('Umra al-Qada')</B><P>Anas mentioned it from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>4005. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, went on <I>'umra </I>during Dhu'l-Qa'da, but the peopleof Makka refused to let him enter Makka until he completed an agreement withthem that he would remain there three days. When they wrote the document,they wrote, 'This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, decides.' They said, 'We will not ratify this. Ifwe knew that you were the Messenger of Allah, we would not have preventedyou at all. Rather you are Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah' He said, 'I am the Messengerof Allah, and I am Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah.' Then he told 'Ali, 'Rub out"Messenger of Allah".' He said, 'No, by Allah, I will never rub you out.'So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, tookthe document, although he could not write well and wrote, 'This is what Muhammadibn 'Abdullah decides. No weapon will enter Makka except in a sheath. Noneof its people will go out if he wishes to follow him and he will not preventany of his Companions who wishes to remain there.' When they entered it andthe term was over, they went to 'Ali and said, 'Tell your companion to leaveus for the term is over.' So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, left and they were followed by the daughter of Hamza, calling out,"Uncle! Uncle!' 'Ali met her and took her hand and he said to Fatima, peacebe upon her, 'Here is the daughter of your uncle. Carry her.' 'Ali, Zaydand Ja'far quarrelled over her. 'Ali said, 'I am more entitled to her. Sheis my uncle's daughter.' Ja'far said, 'She is my uncle's daughter and hermaternal aunt is married to me.' Zayd said, 'She is the daughter of my brother.'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, judged that she shouldgo with her maternal aunt and said, 'The maternal aunt is in the positionof the mother.' He said to 'Ali, 'You are from me and I am from you.' Hesaid to Ja'far, 'You are like me in character and physique.' He said to Zayd,'You are our brother and our client.' 'Ali said, 'Won't you marry Hamza'sdaughter?' He replied, 'She is the daughter of my milk brother.'"<P>4006. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent out to make <I>'umra,</I> but the unbelieversof Quraysh came between him and the House. So he slaughtered his sacrificialcamels and shaved his head at al-Hudaybiyya and made an agreement with themthat he would make <I>'umra </I>the following year and they would carry noweapons except swords, and they would only stay there at long as they wished.So he made<I> 'umra</I> the following year and entered it in accordance withtheir peace agreement. When he had remained there three days, they orderedhim to leave, and he left."<P>4007. It is related that Mujahid said, "'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr and I enteredthe mosque and found 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar sitting next to the room of 'A'isha.He said, 'How many times did the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, do <I>'umra</I>?' He said, 'Four times: once in Rajab.' We heard 'A'isha,Umm al-Mu'minin, cleaning her teeth and so 'Urwa said, 'O Umm al-Mu'minin!Do you not hear what Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman is saying? He says that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went on <I>'umra </I>fourtimes, one of which was in Rajab.' She said, 'The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, did not do any 'umra but that he was present withhim. He never went on 'umra in Rajab.'"<P>4008. It is related that Ibn Abi Awfa said, "When the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, did <I>'umra</I>, we shielded him from theboys of the idolaters and from them lest they should injure the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."<P>4009. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and his Companions arrived and the idolaterssaid, 'A delegation has come to you which has been weakened by the feverof Yathrib.' So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commandedthem to walk fast for the first three circuits, walking normally betweenthe two corners. If it had not been for his kind-heartedness towards themhe would have commanded them to walk fast for every one of the circuits."<P>It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, arrived in the year in which he had been promised security,he said, 'Walk fast' in order to show the idolaters their strength. Theyidolaters were in the direction of Qu'ayqi'an."<P>[Qu'ayqi'an: a mountain in Makka.]<P>4010. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, went fast at the House and between Safa and Marwa toshow the idolaters his strength."<P>4011. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, married Maymuna while he was in <I>ihram</I>, butconsummated the marriage after he was out of <I>ihram</I>. She died at Saraf."<P>It is added that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, married Maymuna during the Fulfilled 'Umra."<P><P><B>XLII: The expedition to Mu'ta in the land of Syria</B><P>4012. It is related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar reported to him that he stoodover Ja'far on that day when he had been killed and counted fifty wounds,from stabs or strokes, and none of them was on his back."<P>4013. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, put Zayd ibn Haritha in command of the Mu'taexpedition. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'If Zayd is killed, then Ja'far. If Ja'far is killed, then 'Abdullahibn Rawaha.'" 'Abdullah said, "I was with them in that expedition and wesearched for Ja'far ibn Abi Talib and found him among the slain and we foundabout ninety wounds om his body - from stab or shots."<P>4014. It is related from Anas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, announced the deaths of Zayd, Ja'far and Ibn Rawaha to the peoplebefore their news had arrived. He said, "Zayd took the standard and was struckdown. Then Ja'far took it and was struck down. Then Ibn Rawaha took it andwas struck down,' and his eyes were weeping. 'Then one of the swords of Allahtook the banner until Allah gave them victory.'"<P>4015. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the news arrived of the deathsof Ibn Haritha, Ja'far ibn Abi Talib and 'Abdullah ibn Rawaha, the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sat down and his grief was clearlyvisible. I was looking through a crack in the door. A man came to him andsaid, 'Messenger of Allah, the women of Ja'far.'" She said, "And he mentionedtheir weeping. He told him to forbid them." He said, "The man went and thenreturned saying that he had forbidden them but they had not obeyed him."He said, "He commanded him to go again, and he went and returned yet againand said, 'By Allah, they are too much for us.'" She claimed that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Put dust in theirmouths." 'A'isha said, "I said. 'May Allah rub your nose in the dust! ByAllah, you did not do what he ordered you to do nor did you spare the Messengerof Allah's distress!'"<P>4016. It is related that 'Amir said, "Whenever Ibn 'Umar greeted Ibn Ja'far,he would say, 'Peace be upon you, son of the one with two wings.'"<P>4017. It is related that Khalid ibn al-Walid said, "On the Day of Mu'ta,nine swords broke in my hand and I only had left a Yemeni broadsword in myhand."<P>4018. It is related that Khalid ibn al-Walid said, "On the Day of Mu'ta,nine swords shattered in my hand and I only had left a Yemeni broadswordin my hand."<P>4019. It is related that an-Nu'man ibn Bashir said, "'Abdullah ibn Rawahafainted and his sister 'Amra began to weep and say, 'What a paragon he was!'and this and that, repeating them. When he recovered consciousness, he said,'You did not say anything without it being said to me, "Are you really likethat?"'"<P>4020. It is related that an-Nu'man ibn Bashir said, "'Abdullah ibn Rawahafainted..." with this hadith. "So when he died, she did not weep over him."<P><P><B>XLIII: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sending Usamaibn Zayd to al-Huruqat, a tribe of Juhayna</B><P><B> </B>4021. It is related that Usama ibn Zayd said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent us to al-Huraqa, and in themorning we defeated the people, I and a man of the Ansar caught up to oneof their men. When we overpowered him, he said, 'There is no god but Allah.'The Ansari held back from him and I stabbed him with my spear until I killedhim. When we arrived, that reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and he said, 'O Usama, did you kill him after he said, "Thereis no god but Allah"? I said. "He was trying to save himself.' He continuedto repeat it until I wished that I had not become Muslim before that day."<P>4022. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "I went on seven expeditionswith the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I went outin nine expeditions which he sent out. Once Abu Bakr was our commander andonce it was Usama."<P>It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "I went out on seven expeditionswith the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and also wentout in nine expeditions which he sent out. One Abu Bakr was in charge ofus and once it was Usama.<P>4023. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "I went on seven expeditionswith the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I raided withIbn Haritha when he was put in command over us."<P>4024. It is related that Salama ibn al-Akwa' said, "I went on seven expeditionswith the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." Then he mentionedKhaybar, al-Hudaybiya, the Battle of Hunayn, and the Battle of al-Qarad."Yazid said, "I forgot the rest of them."<P><P><B>XLIV: The expedition of the Conquest and what Hatib ibn Abi Balta'a sentto the people of Makka to inform them about the expedition of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace</B><P>4025. It is related that 'Ubaydullah ibn Abi Rafi' said, "I heard 'Ali say,'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, dispatchedme, az-Zubayr and al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad, saying, "Go until you reach themeadow Khakh. There will be a woman in a howdah with a letter. Take it fromher." He said, "We went out and made our horses gallop until we reached themeadow and found the woman. We ordered her, "Produce the letter." She replied,"I do not have a letter." We said, "You will bring out the letter or we willtake your clothes." She brought it out from her plaided hair. We took itto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and itcontained something from Hatib ibn Abi Balta'a to some of the idolaters amongthe people of Makka, informing them about some of the business of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, "O Hatib, what is this?"He replied, "O Messenger of Allah, do not be hasty with me. I am a man whowas attached to the Quraysh." He said, "I was an ally, but I was not oneof them while those of the Muhajirun with you have relatives in Makka whowill protect their family and property. Since I lacked that lineage amongthem, I wanted to do them some favour with which to protect my relatives.I did not do it out of disbelief or apostasy, nor out of being pleased withdisbelief after Islam." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "He has told you the truth."<P>'Umar said, "O Messenger of Allah, let me strike off the head of this hypocrite!"He replied, "He was present at Badr and what will inform you? Perhaps Allahlooked down on the people of Badr and said, 'Do what you like. I have forgivenyou.'"'<P>So Allah sent down the <I>sura</I>, <I>'O you who believe! Do not take Myenemy and your enemy as friends, showing love for them when they have rejectedthe truth that has come to you</I> - to His words - <I>Any of you who dothat have strayed from the Right Way.' </I>(60:1)"<P><P><B>XLV: The expedition of the Conquest during Ramadan</B><P>4026. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, made the expedition of the Conquest during Ramadan."<P>Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab was heard to say the like of it.<P>It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, fasted until he reached al-Kadid, a water sourcebetween Qudayd and 'Usfan - where he broke his fast. He broke his fast untilthe end of the month."<P>4027. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, set out from Madina in Ramadan with ten thousandmen, eight and a half years after he had arrived in Madina. He and the Muslimswith him went to Makka and he and they were fasting until they reached al-Kadid,a water source between Qudayd and 'Usfan - where he broke his fast and therest of the people broke their fast."<P>Az-Zuhri said, "One takes the latest command of the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace."<P>4028. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, set off for Hunayn in Ramadan and the people disagreed,some were fasting and some were not fasting. When he was upright on his camel,he asked for a glass of milk or water and put it on his hand (or on his camel).Then he looked at the people and said to the fasters and those who were notfasting, 'Break your fast.'"<P>It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, went out in the year of the Conquest."<P>It is related from Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>4029. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, travelled in Ramadan and fasted until he reached'Usfan. Then he called for a vessel of water and drank during the day sothat the people would see him and ceased fasting until he reached Makka."<P>Ibn 'Abbas used to say, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, both fasted and broke his fast in the journey. So whoeverwishes to can fast and whoever wishes to can break his fast.<P><P><B>XLVII: Where the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, fixedthe standard on the Day of the Conquest</B><P>4030. It is related that Hisham's father said, "When the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, travelled in the year of the Conquest,Quraysh heard about that and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, Hakim ibn Hiram and Budaylibn Warqa' went out to look for news of the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace. They travelled until they reached Marr az-Zahranand there were fires like the fires of 'Arafa. Abu Sufyan asked, 'What isthis? It looks like the fires of 'Arafa!' Budayl ibn Warqa' replied, 'Thefires of the Banu 'Amr.' Abu Sufyan said, ''Amr are less than that.' Someof the sentries of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, saw them and caught them and brought them to the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Abu Sufyan became Muslim.When the Prophet travelled, he told al-'Abbas, 'Keep Abu Sufyan at the peakof the mountain so that he can see the Muslims.' Al-'Abbas kept him therewhile the tribes began to pass with the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, passing squadron after squadron in front of Abu Sufyan.A squadron passed and he asked, ''Abbas, who are these?' He rplied, 'Theseare Ghifar.' He said, 'I have nothing to do with Ghifar.' Then Juhayna passedand he said the like of that. Then Sa'd ibn Hudhaym passed and he said thelike of that. Sulaym passed and he said the like of that, until a squadronpased whose like he had not seen. He asked, 'Who are these?' He said, 'Theseare the Ansar led by Sa'd ibn 'Ubada who has the standard.' Sa'd ibn 'Ubadasaid, 'O Abu Sufyan! Today is the day of battle. Today the Ka'ba will bemade lawful!' Abu Sufyan said, 'O 'Abbas, how splendid the day of ragingwar is!' Then a squadron came, which was the smallest of the squadrons, amongwhich were the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and his Companions. The banner of the Prophet* was with az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam.When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, passedby Abu Sufyan, he said, 'Do you know what Sa'd ibn 'Ubada said?' He asked,'What did he say?' He said, 'Such-and-such.' He said, 'Sa'd lied. Ratherthis is a day in which Allah will exalt the Ka'ba, and a day in which theKa'ba will be covered.'" He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, commanded that his banner be fixed at al-Hajun."<P>It is related from Nafi' ibn Jubayr, "I heard al-'Abbas say to az-Zubayribn al-'Awwam, ''Abdullah! It is here that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, commands you to fix the banner.'"<P>He said, "On that day the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, commanded Khalid ibn al-Walid to enter from the upper part ofMakka from Kada' while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,entered from Kuda. On that day two men of the cavalry of Khalid ibn al-Walidwere killed: Hubaysh ibn al-Ash'ar and Kurz ibn Jabir al-Fihri.<P>4031. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal said, "I saw the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Day of the Conqueston his she-camel, reciting <I>Surat al-Fath</I>, his voice quivering withit. He [Mu'awiya ibn Qurra] said, "Were I not afraid that the people wouldgather, I would chant it as he chanted it."<P>4032. It is related that Usama ibn Zayd said in the time of the Conquest,"Messenger of Allah, where will you stay tomorrow? In your house in Makka?"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, replied, "Did 'Aqilleave us any house?" Then he said, "The believer does not inherit from theunbeliever nor the unbeliever from the believer."<P>Az-Zuhri was asked, "Who inherited from Abu Talib?" He replied, "'Aqil andTalib inherited."<P>Ma'mar has from az-Zuhri, "Where will you stay tomorrow" in his hajj, andYunus did not say, "in his hajj nor 'in the time of the Conquest.'"<P>4033. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah. may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "If Allah gives us victory, Prophetwilling, our stopping place will be al-Khayf, where they took the oath ofdisbelief."<P>4034. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace,said when we made for Hunayn, 'Our stoppingplace tomorrow will, Allah willing, be Khayf Bani Kinana where they tookthe oath of disbelief.'"<P>4035. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, entered Makka in the year of the Conquestwith a helmet on his head. When he removed it, a man came and said, 'IbnKhatal is holding onto the cover of the Ka'ba.' He said, 'Kill him.'"<P>Malik said, "On that day, as far we know - and Allah knows best - the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was not in <I>ihram</I>."<P>4036. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, entered Makka in the year of the Conquest and therewere 360 idols around the House. He began to poke them with a stick in hishand saying, <I>'Truth has come and falsehood has vanished,' </I>(17:81)<I>'The Truth has come. Falsehood cannot originate or regenerate.' </I>(34:49)"<P>4037. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, came to Makka, he refused to enter theHouse as long as there were idols in it. He commanded that they be takenout and they were. They brought out a picture showing Ibrahim and Isma'ilholding divining arrows in their hands. The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah fight them! They know that neitherof them ever divined with them.' Then he entered the House and said the<I>takbir</I> in each of its corners but went out without praying in it."<P>Ma'mar corroborated it from Ayyub.<P>It is related from 'Ikrima from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P><P><B>LXVII: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, enteringfrom the upper part of Makka</B><P>4038. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar &#163; that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came on the Day of the Conquestfrom the upper part of Makka on his riding-camel and Usama ibn Zayd was ridingbehind him. Bilal and 'Uthman ibn Talha, who was one of the gatekeepers,were with him. He made his camel kneel in the mosque and commanded him tobring the key of the House. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, entered the House with Usama ibn Zayd, Bilal, and 'Uthmanibn Talha. He remained in it a long time and then went out and the peoplerushed up, 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar was the first to enter and he found Bilalstanding behind the door. He asked him, "Where did the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray?" He pointed to the place wherehe had prayed. 'Abdullah said, "I forgot to ask him how many prostrationshe had made."<P>4039. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, entered on the Day of the Conquest from Kada', which isin the upper part of Makka."<P>Abu Usama and Wuhayb corroborated him in Kada'.<P>4040. It is related from Hisham's father, "In the Year of the Conquest, theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered from Kada' fromthe upper part of Makka."<P><P><B>XLVIII: The camping of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, on the Day of the Conquest</B><P>4041. It is related that Ibn Abi Layla said, "No one but Umm Hani' informedus that they had seen the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,pray <I>Duha</I>. She mentioned that on the day Makka was conquered, theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did <I>ghusl</I> in herhouse and prayed eight <I>rak'ats</I>. 'I never saw him do a more rudimentaryprayer than it, but he did a complete <I>ruku' </I>and <I>sujud</I>.'"<P>4042. It is related that 'A'isha said, "In his <I>ruku' </I>and <I>sujud</I>the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, 'Glorybe to You, O Allah, our Lord, and with Your praise. O Allah, forgive me!'"<P>4043. It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr about that Ibn 'Abbas said, "'Umaribn al-Khattab used to let me enter with the shaykhs of Badr. 'One of themasked, 'Why do you let this lad enter with us when we have sons of the sameage?&Otilde; He said, 'He is from what you know.'"<P>He said, "One day he invited them and invited me with them, and I only thinkthat he invited me on that day in order to show them something about me.He said, 'What do you say about, <I>'When Allah's help and victory have arrivedand you have seen people entering Allah's deen in droves</I>,' to the endof the <I>sura</I> (110) Some of them said, 'We are commanded to praise Allahand to ask His forgiveness when we are given help and are given victory,'and some of them said, 'We do not know' or did not say anything. He saidto me, 'Ibn 'Abbas, is that what you say?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'And whatdo you say?' I said, 'It is the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, being informed by Allah of the end of his life. <I>'WhenAllah's help and victory have arrived'</I> is the Conquest of Makka. Thatis the sign of your term. <I>"Then glorify your Lord's praise and ask Hisforgiveness. He is the Ever-Returning."</I>' 'Umar said, 'I do not know otherthan what you know of it.'"<P>4044. It is related that Abu Shurayh al-'Adawi said to 'Amr ibn Sa'id whenhe was sending his troops to Makka, "O Amir! Let me tell you what the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said on the day after the Conquestof Makka which I heard with my own ears and grasped with my heart and myeyes saw him when he uttered it. He praised and glorified Allah and thensaid, 'Makka was made a sanctuary by Allah and not by people. So it is notlawful for anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood init or cut down a tree in it. If anyone allows it because the Messenger ofAllah fought in it, then say that Allah gave His Messenger permission andhe did not give you permission. I was only given permission in it for a singlehour of one day, and now its sanctity has reverted to what it was previously.Let the one who is present convey to the one who absent.'" Abu Shurayh wasasked, "What did 'Amr say?" He said that 'Amr said, "I know better than you,Abu Shurayh. The Haram does not give refuge to one who rebels, to any fugitivekiller, nor anyone who flees after taking something unlawfully."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that <I>kharba</I> means that which is wasted.<P>4045. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that he heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say in the year of theConquest when he was in Makka, "Allah and His Messenger have forbidden tradingin wine."<P><P><B>XLIX: The stay of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,in Makka in the time of the Conquest</B><P>4046. It is related that Anas said, "We prayed with the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, for ten days during which he shortened theprayer."<P>4047. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, stayed in Makka for nineteen days in which he prayedtwo <I>rak'ats</I>."<P>4048. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "We stayed with the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, for nineteen days on a journey duringwhich he shortened the prayers." Ibn 'Abbas said, "When we travel somewherefor nineteen days we would shorten the prayer but if we stayed longer wewould do the full prayer."<P><P><B>L: Those who were present at the Conquest of Makka</B><P>4049. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Tha'laba ibn Su'ayr whose face theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, touched in the year ofthe Conquest...<P>4050. It is related from az-Zuhri, "While we were with Ibn al-Musayyab, SunaynAbi Jamila reported to us. Abu Jamila stated that he had met the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and had gone out with him in theyear of the Conquest.<P>4051. It is related from 'Amr ibn Salima.<P>Ayyub said, "Abu Qilaba said to me, 'Will you not meet him and question him?'So I met him and questioned him and he said: 'We were at a water placemuch-frequented by people, and the caravans would pass by us and we wouldask the people, "What is wrong with the people? What is wrong with the people?Who is this man?" They would say, "He claims that Allah has sent him andhas revealed to him (or "that Allah has revealed such-and-such") .I usedto memorise those words and it was as if that was fixed in my heart, TheArabs waited until the Conquest to become Muslim. They used to say, "Leavehim and his people. If he overcomes them, then he is a truthful Prophet."When the Conquest took place, all the people rushed to become Muslim, andmy father rushed to become Muslim before his people. When he arrived back,he said, "By Allah, I have truly come to you from the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace,. He said, "Pray such-and-such a prayer atsuch-and-such a time, and pray such-and-such a prayer at such-and-such atime. When the time of the prayer comes, then let one of you announce it,and let the one of you who has the most Qur'an lead you." They looked andthere was no one who had more Qur'an than me since I used to learn it fromthe caravans. They put me in front of them when I was only about six or sevenyears old, wearing a cloak. When I prostrated, I was exposed. A woman ofthe tribe said, "Will you not cover the ass of your recitor?" So they boughtand made a shirt for me. I have never so happy with anything as I was withthat shirt.'"<P>4052. It is related from 'A'isha from the Prophet*.<P>It is related that 'A'isha said, "'Utba ibn Abi Waqqas took an undertakingfrom his brother, Sa'd, to take the son of the slavegirl of Zam'a. 'Utbasaid, 'He is my son.' When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, came to Makka during the Conquest, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas tookthe son of the slavegirl of Zam'a and took him to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and 'Abd ibn Zam'a went with him.Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas said, 'He is the son of my brother. He entrusted hisson to me.' 'Abd ibn Zam'a said, 'Messenger of Allah, this is my brother.This is the son of Zam'a. He was born on his bed.' The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked at the son of Zam'a's slavegirland he was the person with the closest resemblance to 'Utba ibn Abi Waqqas.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Heis yours. He is your brother, 'Abd ibn Zam'a,' because he was born on hisbed. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Veil yourself from him, Sawda,' because of the resemblance he saw in himto 'Utba ibn Abi Waqqas."<P>'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "The child belongs to the bed and stones belong to the adulterer."Ibn Shihab said that Abu Hurayra used to state that publicly.<P>4053. It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that s woman stole in the timeof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, duringthe expedition of the conquest. Her people went to Usama ibn Zayd to askhim to intercede. 'Urwa said, "When Usama spoke to him aboout her, the faceof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, changedand he said, 'How can you speak to me when it is a case of one of the legalpunishments of Allah Almighty?' Usama said, 'Ask forgiveness for me, Messengerof Allah.' In the evening, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, stood up and spoke and praised Allah as He deserves andthen said, 'Following on from that, the people before you were destroyedbecause when a noble among them stole, they let him be, but when the weakamong them stole, they carried out the legal punishment on them. By the Onewho has the soul of Muhammad in His hand, if Fatima the daughter of Muhammadwere to steal, I would cut off her hand.' Then the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, commanded that that woman's hand becut off. She repented well after that and married. 'A'isha said, 'She usedto come after that and present her need to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace.'"<P>4054. It is related that Mujashi' said, "I brought my brother to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after the Conquest and I said,'Messenger of Allah, I have brought you my brother to take allegiance basedon emigration.' He said, 'The people of emigration have taken what is init.' I said, 'On what basis will you take his allegiance?' He said, "I willtake his allegiance based on Islam, belief, and jihad.'"<P>[Abu 'Uthman said,] "I met Abu Ma'bad later and he was the elder of them,and asked him and he said, "Mujashi' spoke the truth."<P>4055. It is related that Mujashi' ibn Mas'ud said, "I went with Abu Ma'badto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to give him allegiancebased on emigration." He said, 'Emigration has passed to its people. I willtake his allegiance based on Islam, belief, and jihad.'<P>[Abu 'Uthman said,] "I met Abu Ma'bad later and and asked him and he said,"Mujashi' spoke the truth."<P>It is related from Mujashi' that he brought his brother Mujalid.<P>4056. It is related from Mujahid, "I said to Ibn 'Umar, 'I want to emigrateto Syria.' He said, 'There is no emigration, but only jihad. Go and offeryourself, and if you find something, then do it. Otherwise, good back.<P>It is related from Mujahid, "I said to Ibn 'Umar, and he said, 'There isno emigration today, ' or after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace,' the like of it."<P>4057. It is related from Mujahid ibn Jabr al-Makki that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umarused to say, 'There is no emigration after the Conquest.'"<P>4058. It is related that 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah said, "I visited 'A'isha with'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr al-Laythi and he asked her about emigration. She said,'There is no emigration today. One of the believers would flee with his deento Allah Almighty and to His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, fearing that he would be tempted in it. Today Allah has made Islamvictorious and the believer can worship his Lord wherever he wishes, butthere is jihad and intention.'"<P>4059. It is related from Mujahid that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, stood up on the Day of the Conquest and said, "Allahmade Makka a sanctuary on the day He created the heavens and earth, and itwill remain sanctified by the sanctification of Allah until the Day of Rising.It was not lawful for anyone before me to violate it and will not be lawfulfor anyone after me. It was only made lawful for me for one hour of time.Its game is not to be chased nor its trees cut nor its thorn bushes uprooteddown nor is any dropped thing picked up in it lawful, except by someone whoannounces that he has done so". Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib said, "Exceptfor the <I>idhkhir</I> plant, Messenger of Allah, which is needed for theuse of our goldsmiths and our houses!" Then he was silent and then then said,"Except for the <I>idhkhir</I> plant. It is lawful."<P><P><B>LI: The words of Allah Almighty:</B><P><I>"Allah has helped you on many occasions, including the Day of Hunayn whenyour great numbers delighted you but did not help you in any way, and theearth seemed narrow to you for all its great breadth, and you turned yourbacks. Then Allah sent down His Serenity on His Messenger and on the believers,and sent down troops you could not see, and punished those who rejected.That is how the rejectors are repaid. Then after that Allah will turn towardsanyone He wills. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </I>(9:26-27)<P>4060. It is related that Isma'il said, "I saw a scar on the hand of Ibn AbiAwfa and he said, 'I received it with the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, in the Battle of Hunayn.' I said, 'You were present at Hunayn?'He said, 'Yes, and before it.'"<P>4061. It is related from al-Bara' that a man came to him and said , "O Abu'Umara! Did you retreat on the day of Hunayn?" He said, "I testify that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not retreat.However, the hasty people rushed away and Hawazin shot at them. Abu Sufyanibn al-Harith had hold of the head of his white mule and the Prophet wassaying, 'I am the Prophet and it is no lie. I am the son of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib.'<P>4062. It is related that Abu Ishaq said, "While I was listening, al-Bara'was asked, 'Did you retreat with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, on the day of Hunayn?' He replied, 'The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, did not retreat. They were archers and he was saying,"'I am the Prophet and it is no lie. I am the son of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib."'"<P>4063. It is related that a man of Qays asked al-Bara', "Did you flee fromthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the Dayof Hunayn?" He said, "But the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, did not flee. Hawazin are archers. When we attacked them,they were routed. We swooped on the booty and were met with arrows. I sawthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on his whilemule and Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith had hold of its rein and the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was saying, 'I am the Prophet and itis no lie. I am the son of 'Abdu'l-Muttalib.'"<P>Isra'il and Zuhayr said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, dismounted from his mule."<P>4064. It is related from Marwan ibn al-Hakam and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama thatwhen the delegation of Hawazin came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, as Muslims, he stood up. They asked him torestore to them their property and their people who had been captured. TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to them,'Along with me are those whom you se. The statement I love the most is theone which is most sincere. Choose one of the two - either the captives orthe property. I have delayed distributing them.' The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had waited for them for about tendays after returning from Ta'if. When it was apparent to them that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would only return oneof the two to them, they said, 'We choose the captives.' The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up among the Muslimsand praised Allah as He deserves and then said, 'Following on from that:these brothers of yours have come in repentance and I think that the captivesshould be returned to them. Any of you who are happy with this should dothat. Any of you who want to keep their share until we can pay him from thefirst spoils which Allah brings us may do that. The people said, 'We arehappy to do that in their case for the sake of the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'We do not know which of you have allowedit and which have not. Go back so that your leaders can inform us of yourdecision.' The people went back and their leaders spoke to them and thenthey returned to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, and told him, 'They are happy with that and give their permission.'""This is what reached me about the captives of Hawazin."<P>4065. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar said, "Messenger of Allah..."<P>It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "When we returned from Hunayn, 'Umar askedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about a vow he hadmade during the time of <I>Jahiliyya</I> to do <I>i'tikaf</I> and the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded him to fulfill it."<P>It is related from Ibn 'Umar.<P>It is related from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>4066. It is related that Abu Qatada said, "We went out with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of Hunayn.When we met them, the Muslims were routed. I saw a man of the idolaters overa man of the Muslims, and I struck him from behind and hit with the swordon the shoulder vein and cut his armour. He turned against me and seizedme so fiercely that I felt death approaching. Then death overcame him andhe released me. I caught up to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab and said, 'What is wrongwith the people?' He said, 'The command of Allah, the Mighty and exalted.'Then they returned. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,sat and said, 'Whoever killed someone and has proof of it will have his spoils.'I stood up and said, 'Who will testify for me?' Then I sat down. Then theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said the same thing andI stood up and said, 'Who will testify for me?' Then I sat down. Then theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said the like of it a thirdtime. I stood up and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'What is wrong, Abu Qatada?' I recounted the story to himand a man said, 'He spoke the truth. I have his spoils with me, so compensatehim on my behalf.' Abu Bakr said, 'No, by Allah, he will not go to one ofthe lions of Allah who fought for Allah and His Mesenger to give you hisspoils.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Hespoke the truth. Give it to him,' and he gave them to me and I sold the armourand with it I bought a garden in the Banu Salama, and it was the first propertywhich I gained in Islam.'"<P>4067. It is related that Abu Qatada said, "In the Battle of Hunayn, I sawa man of the Muslims who was fighting a man of the idolaters and anotheridolworshipper was creeping up from behind him to kill him. I hurried tothe one who was trying to trick him and he raiused his hand to strike meand I struck off his hand, Then he grabbed me and squeezed me so fiercelythat I was alarmed. Then he stopped and loosened his hold and I pushed himand then killed him. The Muslims were routed and I was routed with them.Then there was 'Umar ibn al-Khattab among the people and I said to him, 'Whatis wrong with the people?' He said, 'The command of Allah.' Then the peoplereturned to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoeverhas proof of someone he killed will have his spoils.' I stood up lookingfor proof of the one I had killed, but I did not see anyone who would testifyfor me, so I sat down. Then it occurred to me mentioned the business to theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and a man whowas sitting with him said, 'The weapons of this slain man whom he mentionedare with me, so compensate him on my behalf.' Abu Bakr said, 'No, he willnot give to a fledging of Quraysh and leave one of the lions of Allah whofought for Allah and His Messenger.'" He said, "The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, got up and gave it to me and I usedthem to buy a garden, and it was the first property which I gained in Islam."<P><P><B>LII: The expedition of Awtas</B><P>4068. It is related that Abu Musa said, "When the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, finished at Hunayn, he sent Abu 'Amir at the headof an army to Awtas. He met Durayd ibn as-Simma and Durayd was killed andAllah defeated his companions." Abu Musa said, "He sent me with Abu 'Amirand Abu 'Amir was shot in his knee. A man of Jushm shot him with an arrow,I got to him and said, 'Uncle, who has shot you?' He pointed him out to meand said, 'That is my killer who shot me. I made for him and caught him.When he saw him, he retreated and I followed him and started to say to him,'Are you not ashamed? Won't you stand firm?' He stopped and we exchange twoblows with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu 'Amir, 'Allahhas killed your person.' He said, 'Pull this arrow out.' I pulled it outand water gushed from it. He said, 'Nephew, give my greeting to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and ask him to ask for forgivenessfor me,' and he appointed me as his successor. A short time later he died.I returned and went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,in his house. He was on a bed of mats tied together on top of which was somebedding. The marks of the bed were on his back and sides. I gave him thenews and the news about Abu 'Amir and that he said, 'Ask him to ask forforgiveness for me.' He called for water and did wudu' and then raised hishands and said, 'O Allah, forgive 'Ubayd Abu 'Amir!' I saw the whites ofhis armpits. Then he said, 'O Allah, place above many of the people You havecreated on the Day of Rising!' I said, 'And ask forgiveness for me!' He said,'O Allah, fotgive 'Abdullah ibn Qays his wrong actions and admit with a nobleentry on the Day of Rising." Abu Burda said, "One of them was for Abu 'Amirand the other for Abu Musa."<P><P><B>LIII: The expedition of Ta'if</B><P>On Shawwal, 8 A.H. Musa ibn 'Uqba said that.<P>4069. It is related from Umm Salama, "The Prophet , may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, visited me when there was a hermaphropdite with me and heardhim say to 'Abdullah ibn Umayya, 'O 'Abdullah! If you think that Allah willlet you conquer tomorrow, then you must have the daughter of Ghaylan. Shehas four folds facing you and eight with her back to you.' The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not let those people visityou (women).'"<P>Ibn Jurayj said, "The hermaphropdite was called Hit."<P>This is related from Hisham who added, "He was besieging Ta'if on that day."<P>4070. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "When the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, lay siege to Ta'if and didnot obtain anything in regard to them, he said, 'We are returning, Prophetwilling.' That was hard of them and they said, 'We will leave withoutconquering!' Once he said, 'Let us return,' and then he said, 'Fight tomorrow.'So the new day they fought and many were wounded.He said, 'We are returningtomorrow. Allah willing.' That pleased them and the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, laughed." Once Sufyan said, "He smiled."<P>Al-Humaydi said. "Sufyan related the entire report to us."<P>4071. It is related that Abu 'Uthman said, "I heard Sa'd, who was the firstto shoot an arrow in the way of Allah, and Abu Bakra who scaled the wallof the fortress of Ta'if with some people and then went to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'We heard the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, say, "Whoever claims to be the son of otherthan his father, the Garden is unlawful for him."'"<P>4072. It is related by Abu'l-'Aliyya or Abu 'Uthman from Sa'd and Abu Bakra.'Asim said, "I said, 'Two men who are fully reliable testified in your presence.'He said, 'Yes. One of them was the first to shoot an arrow in the way ofAllah and the other came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, with twenty-three people from Ta'if."<P>4073. It is related that Abu Musa said, "I was with the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, when he camped at al-Ji'rana between Makkaand Madina. Bilal was with him. A bedouin came to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Will you not fulfil what you promisedme?' He said to him, 'Rejoice.' He said, 'You have said, "rejoice" to metoo many times.'" [Abu Burda said,] "He turned to Abu Musa and Bilal as ifhe were angry and said, 'He has rejected the good news, so you too acceptit.' They both said, 'We accept.' Then he called for a bowl of water andwashed his hands and face in it and spat in it and then said, 'Drink fromit and pour it on your faces and throats and take the good news.' So theytook the bowl and did that. Umm Salama called from behind the curtain, 'Keepsome of it for your mother,' and so they kept some of it for her."<P>4074. It is related that Safwan ibn Ya'la said, "Ya'la said to 'Umar, 'Showme the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he is receivingrevelation.' While the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was at al-Ji'rana with some of his Companions, a man came to him and said,'Messenger of Allah, what do you think about a man who goes into ihram for'umra while covered with scent?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was silent for a time and then revelation came upon him. 'Umarbeckoned to Ya'la and Ya'la came over and there was a cloth over the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, shading him. He peeredunder it and the face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, was red and he was snoring. Then the state left him andhe said, 'Where is the man who asked about 'umra?' A man was brought andhe said, 'Wash off any perfume on you three times and remove your cloak.Do the same for 'umra as you do for hajj.'"<P>Ibn Jurayj said, "I said to 'Ata', "Did he mean purification when he instructedhim to wash three times?' He said, 'Yes.'" [done]<P>4075. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Zayd ibn 'Asim said, "When Allah gavespoils to His Messenger on the Day of Hunayn, he divided it up among thosewhose hearts were to be reconciled and did not give the Ansar anything. Theyseemed to be aggrieved since they had not received what the people had received.He addressed them and said, 'O company of Ansar! Did I not find you misguidedand then Allah guided you by me? And you were split up and Allah broughtyou together by me? You were poor and Allah enriched you by me?' Wheneverhe said anything, they said, 'Allah and His Messenger are more gracious.'He said, 'What stops you from answering the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace?'" He said, "Whenever he said anything, theysaid, 'Allah and His Messenger are more gracious.' He said, 'If you wish,you could say, "You came us like this and like that." Are you content thatthe people leave with sheep and camels and you leave for your homes withthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace? Were it not for emigration,I would like to be one of the Ansar. If the people were to travel througha valley and ravine, I would travel and valley and ravine of the Ansar. TheAnsar are the garment next to the skin while other people are the outer garment.You will find self-interest after me, so be patient until you meet me atthe Basin.'"<P>4076. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that when Allah gave the booty whichHe gave to His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Hawazin,and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to give ahundred camels to some men of Quraysh, some of the Ansar said about the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "May Allah forgive theMessenger of Allah! He gives to Quraysh and leaves us out even though ourswords are dripping with their blood." Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was informed about what they saidand so he sent to the Ansar and gathered them together in a hide tent. Hedid not invite anyone else with them. When they were together, the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to them and said,'What is this talk which I have heard that you said?' The learned of theAnsar said to him, 'Our leaders did not say anything, Messenger of Allah.However, some of the young people among us said, "May Allah forgive the Messengerof Allah! He gives to Quraysh and leaves us out even though our swords aredripping with their blood."' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'I give to men who were recently unbelievers to reconcile them.Are you not pleased to let people go with property while you return to yourhomes with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?By Allah, You will return with better than what they are returning with.'They said, 'Messenger of Allah, we are pleased!' He said to them, 'You willsee great self-interest after me, so be patient until you meet Allah Almightyand His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at the Basin.'"Anas said, "But they were not patient."<P>4077. It is related that Anas said, "On the day of the Conquest of Makka,the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, dividedup the booty between Quraysh and the Ansar became angry. The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Are you not pleased to let peoplego with this world while you return to your homes with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' They said, 'Yes, indeed.' He said,'If the people were to travel through a valley or ravine, I would traveland valley or ravine of the Ansar.'"<P>4078. It is related that Anas said, "On the day of the Conquest of Makka,the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, dividedup the booty between Quraysh and the Ansar became angry. The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Are you not pleased to let peoplego with this world while you return to your homes with the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' They said, 'Yes, indeed.' He said,'If the people were to travel through a valley or ravine, I would traveland valley or ravine of the Ansar.'"<P>4079. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, gathered together some people of the Ansar and said,'Quraysh are still close to the <I>Jahiliyya</I> and have just had losses.I want to restore them and reconcile them. Are you content to let the peoplereturn with this world while you return to your homes with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?' They said, 'Yes.' Hesaid, 'If people were travel in a valley and the Ansar were to travel a ravine,I would choose the valley of the Ansar - or the ravine of the Ansar.'"<P>4080. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "When the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, divided up the spoils of Hunayn, a man of the Ansarsaid, 'He does not desire the face of Allah by it.' I went to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and informed him and his face changedcolour. Then he said, 'May Allah have mercy on Musa! He was abused more thanthis and he was patient.'"<P>4081. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "On the Day of Hunayn, the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, favoured some people overothers in his division of the spoils. He gave al-Aqra' ibn Habis a hundredcamels and gave 'Uyayna ibn Hisn the same. He also gave to some other people.A man said, 'By Allah, this a division by which the face of Allah is notdesired.' I said, 'I will inform the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace!' He said, 'May Allah have mercy on Musa! He was abused more thanthis and he was patient.'"<P>4082. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "On the Day of Hunayn, Hawazin,Ghatafan and others arrived with their animals and families to fight [theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace], and the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, had ten thousand with him as well as thosewho became Muslim at the Conquest. They turned back until he alone remainedand he made two calls on that day which were distinct. He turned to his rightand said, 'O company of Ansar!' They said, 'At your service, Messenger ofAllah! Rejoice! We are with you.' Then he turned to his left and said, 'Ocompany of Ansar!' They said, 'At your service, Messenger of Allah! Rejoice!We are with you.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, was on a white mule and he dismounted and said, 'I am the slave ofAllah and His Messenger.' Then the idolaters were routed and on that daya lot of booty was taken. He divided it up between the Muhajirun and thosehad had become Muslim at the Conquest, but did not give the Ansar anything.The Ansar said, 'When there is difficulty, we are summoned and then he givesthe booty to someone other than us.' That reached him, so he gathered themtogether in a tent and said, 'O company of Ansar, what is this report whichhas reached me about you?' They were silent. He said, 'O company of Ansar,are you content that the people leave with this world and you leave for yourhomes with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,keeping him for yourselves?' They said, 'Yes, indeed.' The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'If the people were travel one valleyand the Ansar were to travel a ravine, I would take the ravine of the Ansar.'"<P>Hisham said, "O Abu Hamza! Were you present at that?" He said, "And how couldI be absent from it?"<P><P><B>LIV: The raiding party sent towards Najd</B><P>4083. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent out a party towards Najd and I was init. Our shares reached twelve camels, and we were each given an extra cameland so we returned with thirteen camels."<P><P><B>LV: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sends Khalidibn al-Walid to the Banu Jadhima</B><P>4084. It is related that Salim's father said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace,sent Khalid ibn al-Walid to the Banu Jadhima andcalled them to Islam. They did not properly say, 'We have surrendered inIslam (<I>aslamna</I>),' and began to say, '<I>Saba'na, saba'na</I> (we havechanged religion).' So Khalid began to kill some of them and capture some.He gave each of us a captive until one day when Khalid ordered every manof us to kill his captive. I said, 'By Allah, I will not kill my captivenor should any man of my companions kill his captive." When we came to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we mentioned it and theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, raised his hands and said,'O Prophet, I am innocent of what Khalid has done!' twice."<P><P><B>LVI: The raiding party of 'Abdullah ibn Hudhafa as-Sahmi and 'Alqama ibnMujziz al-Mudliji. It is called the Raiding Party of the Ansari</B><P>4085. It is related that 'Ali said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, sent out an expedition and put a man of the Ansar in chargeof it and commanded them to obey him. He became angry and said, 'Did notthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, command you to obeyme?' They said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Gather firewood for me,' and they gatheredit. He said, 'Kindle a fire,' and they kindled it. He said, 'Enter it,' andthey meant to enter it and began to hold on to one another, saying, 'We havefled to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from the Fire.'They continued until the fire died down and his anger was stilled. That reachedthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'If theyhad entered it, they would not have come out of it until the Day of Rising.Obedience is in the correct.'"<P><P><B>LVII: The sending out of Abu Musa and Mu'adh to the Yemen before the FarewellPilgimage</B><P>4086. It is related that Abu Burda said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent Abu Musa and Mu'adh ibn Jabal to Yemen.He sent each of them over a region." He said, "Yemen has two regions. Hesaid, 'Be easy and do not be harsh. Cheer people and do not make them averse.'So each of them went to his post. When either of them travelled in his landand was near to his companion, he would promise to visit his companion andgreet him. Mu'adh travelled in his land close to his companion, Abu Musa,and went to him on his mule until he reached him. He was seated and the peoplehad gathered to him and there was a man who had his hands tied to his neck.Mu'adh said to him, ''Abdullah ibn Qays! What is this?' He said, 'This manhas rejected after being Muslim.' He said, 'I will not dismount until heis killed.' He said, 'He has been brought for that, so dismount.' He said,'I will not dismount until he is killed.' So he gave the command and he waskilled. Then he dismounted and said, 'O 'Abdullah! How do you recite theQur'an?' He said. 'I recite it in parts.' He said, 'And how do you reciteit, Mu'adh?' He said, 'I sleep for the first part of the night and then Iget up having finished my portion for sleep and then I recite what Allahhas written for me. I expect a reward for my sleep as I do for my rising.'"<P>4087. It is related from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent him to Yemen and he asked him about drinkswhich were prepared there. He said, 'What are they?' He said, '<I>Bit</I>'and <I>mizr</I>.'" I asked Abu Burda, "What is <I>bit</I>'?" He replied,'It is <I>nabidh</I> made from honey and <I>mizr</I> is <I>nabidh</I> madefrom barley." He added, "Every intoxicant is unlawful."<P>4088. It is related that Abu Burda said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, sent my grandfather, Abu Musa, and Mu'adh to Yemen,and he said, ''Be easy and do not be harsh. Cheer people and do not makethem averse, and you should obey one another.' Abu Musa said, 'O Prophetof Allah! Our land has drinks in it which are made from barley and honey.The drink made from barley is <I>mizr</I> and the drink made from honey is<I>bit</I>'.' He said, 'Every intoxicant is unlawful.' They went and Mu'adhsaid to Abu Musa, 'How do you recite the Qur'an?' He said, 'Standing, sittingand on my riding animal, and I recite it in parts.' He said, 'As for myself,I sleep and then get up, and I expect a reward for my sleep as I do for myrising.' Then he pitched a tent and they began to visit each out. Mu'adhvisited Abu Musa and there was a man in chains. He said, 'What is this?'Abu Musa said, 'A jew who became Muslim and then apostasised.' Mu'adh said,'I will strike his neck!'"<P>It is corroborated by al-'Aqadi and Qahb from Shu'ba, and it is related fromAbu Musa from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<P>Ash-Shaybani related it from Abu Burda.<P>4089. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "The Messenger Of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent me to the land of my peopleand I came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,while he was camping at al-Batha' and he asked, 'Are you doing hajj, 'Abdullahibn Qays?' I replied, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He asked, 'With what intentiondid you go into <I>ihram</I>?' I answered, 'At your service, my <I>ihram</I>is the same as your <I>ihram</I>.' He said, 'Have you brought any sacrificalanimals with you?' I said, 'I have not.' He said, 'Go and do <I>tawaf</I>of the House and run between Safa and Marwa. Then come out of <I>ihram</I>.'I did that and one of the women of Banu Qays and combed my hair. We continuedto do that until the khalifate of 'Umar."<P>4090. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said to Mu'adh ibn Jabal when he sent himto Yemen, "You are going to a people who have a Book. When you come to them,call on them to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammadis the Messenger of Allah. When they obey you in that, then tell them thatAllah has made the five prayers obligatory for them in a twenty-four day.When they obey you in that, inform them that Allah has made it obligatoryfor <I>zakat</I> to be taken from their property and given to their poor.If they obey you in that, beware of the precious things of people and bewareof the supplication of the wronged. There is no screen between him and Allah."<P>Abu 'Abdullah said that <I>tawwa' </I>i<I>s t&acirc;' </I>and <I>at&acirc;'</I>is a dialect. There is <I>ti'tu, tu'tu a</I>nd <I>ata'tu</I>.<P>4091. It is related from 'Amr ibn Maymun that when Mu'adh came to the Yemen,he led them in the <I>Subh</I> prayer and recited, <I>"Allah took Ibrahimfor a friend," </I>(4:125) A man among the people said, "How delighted isthe mother of Ibrahim!"<P>It is added from 'Amr that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, sent Mu'adh to the Yemen and Mu'adh recited <I>Surat an-Nisa</I>'(4) in the <I>Subh</I> prayer and when he said, <I>"Allah took Ibrahim asa friend,"</I> a man behind him said, "How delighted is the mother of Ibrahim!"<P><P><B>LVIII: The dispatch of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah have mercy on him,and Khalid ibn al-Walid to Yemen before the Farewell Pilgrimage</B><P>4092. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, sent us with Khalid ibn al-Walid to Yemen."He said, "Then he sent 'Ali after that in his place. He said, 'Command thepeople with Khalid that whoever of them wishes to remain with you can remain,and whoever wishes can come back.' I was among those who remained behindwith him.'" He said, "I got several <I>uqiyyas</I> of booty."<P>4093. It is related that Burayda said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, sent 'Ali to Khalid to take the <I>khumus</I>. I hated'Ali and he had just had a <I>ghusl</I> and I said to Khalid, 'Will you lookat this one!' When we came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, I mentioned that to him and he said, 'O Burayda, do you hate 'Ali?'I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Do not hate him. He deserves more than that fromthe <I>khumus</I>.'"<P>4094. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "'Ali ibn Abi Talib sentthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a pieceof gold ore from Yemen which was in a piece of tanned leather and had notbeen extracted from its earth." He said, "He divided it between four people:'Uyayna ibn Badr, Aqra' ibn Habis, Zayd al-Khayl and the fourth was either'Alqama or 'Amir ibn at-Tufayl. A man of the Companions said, 'We are moreentitled to it than those.'" He said, "That reached the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'Do you not trust me when I amthe trustworthy in the heaven and the news of heaven comes to me morningand evening?'" He said, "A man with sunken eyes, prominent cheeks, bulgingforehead, thick beard, shaved head and rolled waist-wrapper, stood up andsaid, 'O Messenger of Allah, be fearful of Allah!' He said, 'Woe to you!Am I not the most entitled of the people of the earth to fear Allah?' Thenthe man turned away. Khalid ibn al-Walid said, 'O Messenger of Allah, shallI strike his neck?' He said, 'No, he may pray.' Khalid said, 'There are manywho pray and say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I was not commandedto pierce into the hearts of people nor to split open their bellies.'" Hesaid, "He looked at him while he was turning away and said, 'From the offspringof this one will emerge a people who recite the <I>Book</I> of Allah easilyand constantly, but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass throughthe deen like the arrow passes through game.' And I think he said, 'If Iwere to meet them, I would kill them like Thamud.'"<P>4095. It is related that Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, commanded 'Ali to remain in <I>ihram</I>."<P>It is related that Jabir said, "'Ali ibn Abi Talib came with his charge andthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, 'On whatbasis have you taken on <I>ihram</I>, 'Ali?' He said, 'On the basis thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has taken on<I>ihram</I>.' He said, 'Then sacrifice and remain in <I>ihram</I> as youare." He said, "'Ali sacrificed an animal for him."<P>4096. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, took on <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra </I>and <I>hajj</I>. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took on <I>ihram</I> for <I>hajj</I>and we took on <I>ihram</I> with him. When we came to Makka, he said, 'Whoeverdoes not have a sacrificial animal with him, should make it <I>'umra.'</I>The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had sacrificial animals.'Ali ibn Abi Talib came to us making hajj from Yemen. The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'On what basis have you taken on<I>ihram</I>? Your wife is with us.' He said, 'I have you taken on<I>ihram</I> on the basis that the Prophet* has taken on <I>ihram</I>.' Hesaid, 'Then stay in <I>ihram</I>. We have sacrificial animals with us."<P><P><B>LIX: The expedition of Dhu'l-Khalasa</B><P>4097. It is related that Jarir said, "In the <I>Jahiliyya</I> there was ahouse called Dhu'l-Khalasa, the Yemeni Ka'ba and the Syrian Ka'ba. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Will you not relieve me fromDhu'l-Khalasa?' I set out with one hundred and fifty horsemen and we smashedit and killed those we found at it. I went to the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and informed him and he prayed for us and Ahmas."<P>4098. It is related that Qays said, "Jarir said to me, 'The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, "Will you notrelieve me from Dhu'l-Khalasa?" which was a house of Khath'am which was calledthe Yamani Ka'ba I set out with one hundred and fifty horsemen from Ahmas.They are good horsemen. I could not sit firm on a horse and he (the Prophet)struck me in my chest so that I saw the marks of his fingers on my chestand said, "O Allah, make him firm and make him a guided guide."' He wentto it and broke it up and burnt it. Then he sent the news to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Jarir's messenger said,'By the One who sent you with the truth, I did not come to you until I leftit as if it was an emaciated - or scabby - camel.' He said, 'May Allah blessthe horses and riders of Ahmas' five times."<P>4099. It is related that Jarir said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said to me, 'Will you not relieve me fromDhu'l-Khalasa?' I said, 'Yes indeed!' and I set out with one hundred andfifty horsemen from Ahmas. They are good horsemen. I could not sit firm ona horse and I mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and he struck me in my chest so that I saw the marks of his fingerson my chest and said, 'O Allah, make him firm and make him a guided guide.'"He said, "I have never fallen from a horse since." He said, "Dhu'l-Khalasawas a house in Yemen which belonged to Khath'am and Bajila which containedsome idols which were worshipped. It was called the 'Ka'ba'." He said, "Hewent to it and burned it and smashed it."<P>Qays said, "When Jarir came to the Yemen, there was a man who used arrowsfor divination. He was told, 'The messenger of the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, is here and if he gets hold of you,he will chop off your head.' While he was using them, Jarir stopped overhim and said, 'Break them and testify that there is no god but Allah or Iwill chop off your head.'" He said, "He broke them and testified. Then Jarirsent a man of Ahmas called Abu Arta'a to the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, to give him the good news of that. When he came to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he said, 'Messenger ofAllah, by the One who sent you with the truth, I did not come to you untilI left it as if it was a scabby camel.'" He said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, blessed the horses and men of Ahmasfive times."<P><P><B>LX: The expedition of Dhat as-Salasil</B><P>It is the expedition of Lakhm and Judham. Isma'il ibn Abi Khalid said that.<P>'Urwa said that it is the land of Bali, 'Udhra and Banu'l-Qayn.<P>4100. It is related from Abu 'Uthman that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, appointed 'Amr ibn al-'As over the army ofDhat as-Salasil. He said, "I went to him and asked, 'Which person is themost beloved to you?' He replied, ''A'isha.' I asked, 'Which of the men?'He answered, 'Her father.' I asked, 'Then who?' He said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab,'and he mentioned a number of men. I was silent fearing that he would makeme the last of them."<P><P><B>LXI: Jarir going to Yemen</B><P>4101. It is related that Jarir said, "I was in Yemen and I met two men ofthe people of Yemen - Dhu Kala' and Dhu 'Amr. I began to tell them aboutthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Dhu'Amr said to me, 'If what you are mentioning about your companion is true,then he died three days ago.' They came with me to Madina and some distanceon the way, there were some riders coming from Madina. We questioned themand they said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, has died and Abu Bakr has been appointed his successor and the peopleare well.' The two said, 'Tell your companion that we came and we will returnagain, Allah willing,' and they returned to Yemen. I told Abu Bakr aboutthem and he said, 'Did you not bring them!' Some time later Dhu 'Amr saidto me, 'O Jarir, you have done a kindness to me and so I will tell you something.You, the nation of Arabs, will remain in good as long as when an amir dies,you give command to another. When it is done by the sword, then they willbecome kings who will be angry as kings are and who will be pleased as kingsare.'"<P><P><B>LXII: The expedition of the sea coast where they were to meet the caravanof Quraysh. Their commander was Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah </B><P>4102. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent an expedition towards the coastand put Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah in command of it. There were three hundredmen and I was one of them. We went out until we were part of the way andthe provisions finished. Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah commanded that the provisionsof that army be gathered up and it was gathered. Our provision consistedof dates. He fed us a little every day until it was finished. Our share wasonly one date each." [Wahb ibn Kisan said,] "I said, 'What use would onedate be to you?' He said, 'We felt its absence when it was finished. Thenwe reached the coast and there was a large fish like a small hill. That armyate from it for eighteen days. Then Abu 'Ubayda ordered that two of its ribsbe set up and then he ordered a camel to be ridden and it passed under themwithout touching them.'"<P>4103. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent us, three hundred riders, whosecommander was Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, to ambush the caravan of Quraysh.We remained on the coast for half a month and we afflicted by terrible hungerso that we ate the leaves of the khabt tree and so that army was called theArmy of al-Khabat. The sea cast up an animal for us which is called a spermwhale and we ate from it for half a month and we oiled ourselves with itsfat until our bodies returned to their former strength, Abu 'Ubayda tookone of its ribs and set it upright and had to the tallest man with him passunder it." Sufyan said once, 'He set up one of its ribs and had a man anda camel pass under it."<P>Jarir said, "One man of the people slaughtered three camels, and then slaughteredanother three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then Abu'Ubayda forbade him."<P>It is related that Qays ibn Sa'd said to his father, "I was in the army andwe became hungry. He said 'Then slaughter.' He said, 'I slaughtered.' Hesaid 'Then they were hungry.' He said, 'Then slaughter.' He said, 'Islaughtered.' He said 'Then they were hungry." He said 'Then slaughter.'He said, 'I slaughtered.' He said 'Then they were hungry." He said, 'Thenslaughter.' He said, 'I slaughtered.' He said 'Then they were hungry.' Hesaid, 'Then slaughter.' He said, 'I was forbidden.'"<P>It is related that Jabir said, "We went out in the army of al-Khabat andAbu 'Ubayda was put in command. We became very hungry and the sea cast upa dead fish whose like we had not seen, called a sperm whale. We ate fromit for half a month. Abu 'Ubayda set up one of its bones and a rider pasedunder it."<P>4104. Abu'z-Zubayr reported that he heard Jabir say, "Abu 'Ubayda said, 'Eat.'When we reached Madina, we mentioned that to the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, and he sad, 'Eat, for it provision which Allah hasbrought out. Feed us if there is any of it with you.' So one of them broughthim part of it and he ate it.'"<P><P><B>LXIII: Abu Bakr makes the hajj with the people on 9 A.H.</B><P>4105. It is related from Abu Hurayra that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq sent him inthe hajj over which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,had put him in charge before the Farewell Pilgimage with a group of peopleto announce among the people on the Day of Sacrifice, "No idolater is tomake the hajj after this year and no one is to do <I>tawaf</I> of the Housenaked."<P>4106. It is related that al-Bara' said, "The last <I>sura</I> to be sentdown complete was <I>Bara'a</I> (9) and the last part of a <I>sura</I> tobe sent down was the end of <I>Surat an-Nisa':</I> <I>'They will ask youfor a definitive ruling. Say: 'Allah gives you a definitive ruling aboutpeople who die without direct heirs...' </I>(4:176)"<P><P><B>LXIV: The delegation of Banu Tamim</B><P>4107. It is related that 'Imran ibn Husayn said, "A group came from the BanuTamim to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said,'Banu Tamim, rejoice!' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, you have given usgood news, so give us something.' That was seen in his face. Then some peopleof Yemen came and he said, 'Accept the good news since Banu Tamim have notaccepted it.' They said, 'We accept, Messenger of Allah.'"<P>Ibn Ishaq said, "The expedition of 'Uyayna ibn Hisan ibn Hudayfa ibn Badragainst the Banu'l-'Anbar of the Banu Tamim. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace,sent him against them and he raided them and killedsome of them and took captive some of their women."<P>4108. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I have loved the Banu Tamim sinceI heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,saythree things about them. I heard him say, 'They will be the strongest communityagainst the Dajjal.' 'A'isha had a slavegirl from them and he said, 'Sether free. She is one of the descendants of Isma'il.' When their <I>sadaqa</I>came, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'This is the <I>sadaqa</I> of a people - or our people.'"<P>4109. It is reported from 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr that some riders of theBanu Tamim came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,andAbu Bakr said, "Appoint al-Qa'qa' ibn Ma'bad ibn Zurara in command." 'Umarsaid, "Rather appoint al-Aqra' ibn Habis." Abu Bakr said, "You just wantedto contradict me." 'Umar said, "I did not want to contradict you," and theybegan to quarrel until they raised their voices, it was sent down about that,<I>"O you who believe! Do not put yourselves forward..."</I> (49:1)<P><P><B>LXV: The delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays</B><P>4110. It is related from Abu Jamra, "I said to Ibn 'Abbas, 'I have a jarin which I make <I>nabidh</I> and I drink it while it is sweet in the jar.If I have too much of it and sit with the people and sit for a long time,I am afraid that I will be be disgraced." Ibn 'Abbas said, "The delegationof 'Abdu'l-Qays came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and he said, 'Welcome to the people! May you not suffer disgracenor regret!' They said, 'Messenger of Allah, there are unbelievers of Mudarbetween us and you. We can only come to you in the sacred months Give ussome clear instructions by which we can act enter Paradise and which we canconvey to those we left behind.' He said, 'I command you to do four thingsand forbid you to do four things. You are to believe in Allah. Do you knowwhat belief in Allah is? To testify that there is no god but Allah and thatMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish the prayers, to pay thezakat, to fast Ramadan and to pay the khums (fifth). I forbid you<I>nabidh</I> which is made in the <I>dubba', naqir, hantam</I>, and<I>muzaffat</I>.'"<P>4111. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qayscame to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,'Messenger of Allah, 'This is the tribe of Rabi'a and there are the unbelieversof Mudar between us and you. We can only get to you in the sacred month,Give us some instructions which we can take and convey to those we left behindus.' He said, 'I command you to do four things and forbid you to do fourthings. You are to believe in Allah: to testify that there is no god butAllah - and he indicated one - to establish the prayers, to pay the zakat,to fast Ramadan and to pay the <I>khums</I> (fifth) on the booty you take.I forbid you the <I>dubba', naqir, hantam</I>, and <I>muzaffat</I>.'"<P>4112. It is related from Bukayr that Kurayb, the client of Ibn 'Abbas, relatedto him that Ibn 'Abbas, al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Azharsent him to 'A'isha saying, "Greet her from all of us and ask her about thetwo rak'ats after the <I>'Asr </I>prayer and say to her, 'We were told thatyou pray them although it has come down to us that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, forbade them.'" Ibn 'Abbas said, "I and 'Umaribn al-Khattab used to beat people for doing them."<P>Kurayb said, "I went to 'A'isha and conveyed my message to her. She said,'Ask Umm Salama.' So I went out to them and told them what she had said andthey sent me to Umm Salama with the same message they had sent me to 'A'ishawith. Umm Salama said, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, forbid them and then I saw him praying them after he had prayed<I>'Asr</I>. Then he came in when I had with me some of the women from the BanuHaram of the Ansar. I sent a slavegirl to him and said, "Stand beside himand say to him, 'Umm Salama says to you, "Messenger of Allah, I heard youforbid these two <I>rak'ats</I> but now I see you praying them."' If he makesa gesture with his hand, then wait for him." The slavegirl did that and hemade a gesture with his hand and she waited for him. When he finished, hesaid, "Daughter of Abi Umayya, you have asked me about the two rak'ats after<I>'Asr.</I> Some people from the 'Abdu'l-Qays came to me and kept me toobusy to pray the two <I>rak'ats </I>after <I>Dhuhr</I> and that is what theseare."'"<P>4113. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The first Jumu'a prayer to beheld after the Jumu'a prayer in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was that held in the mosque of 'Abdu'l-Qaysat Juwati, i.e a town in Bahrayn."<P><P><B>LXVI: The delegation of Banu Hanifa, and the story of Thumama ibn Uthal</B><P>4114. It is related that Abu Hurayra was heard to say, "The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, sent some horsemen in the directionof Najd and they came back with a man from the Banu Hanifa called Thumamaibn Uthal whom they bound to one of the pillars of the mosque. The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out to him and said, 'Whatdo you have, Thumama?' He said, 'I have good, O Muhammad. If you kill me,you will kill someone who has killed, and if you are gracious, you will begracious to one who is thankful. If you deserve money, then ask for whatyou want of it.' He was left until the following day and then said to him,'What do you have, Thumama?' He said, 'What I told you. If you are gracious,you will be gracious to one who is thankful.' He left him until the day afterthat and then asked, 'What do you have, Thumama?' He replied, 'I have whatI told you.' He said, 'Release Thumama,' who then went to some palm-treesnear the mosque and washed himself all over. Then he entered the mosque andsaid, 'I testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is theMessenger of Allah. By Allah, O Muhammad! There was no face on the earthmore hated by me than your face and now your face is the most beloved tome. By Allah, there was no deen on the earth more hated by me than your<I>deen</I> and now your <I>deen</I> is the most beloved to me. By Allah,therewas no town on the earth more hated by me than your town and now your townis the most beloved to me. Your cavalry took me when I was meaning to goon <I>'umra</I>. What do you think?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, gave him the good news and commanded him to go on'umra. When he arrived in Makka, someone said to him, 'You have changedreligion?' He said, 'No, but I have become Muslim with Muhammad, the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. No, by Allah, not onegrain of wheat will come to from Yamama until the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, gives permission for it."<P>4115. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Musaylima the Liar arrived duringthe time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,came and he said, 'If Muhammad delegates authority to me after him, I willfollow him.' He came there with a large number of his people. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went up to him with Thabitibn Qays ibn Shammas. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, had a piece of palm branch in his hand until he stood before Musaylimawith his companions. Hr said, 'Even if you were to ask me for this piece,I would not give it you. You will not escape the command of Allah about you.If you turn back, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are the one aboutwhom I have been shown what I was shown. This is Thabit ibn Qays who willanswer you on my behalf.' Then he left him." Ibn 'Abbas said, "I asked aboutthe words of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,'You are the one about whom I have been shown what I was shown.' and AbuHurayra reported to me that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, "While I was asleep, I saw two gold bracelets on myarm and they worried me. Then it was revealed to me in the dream to blowthem off, and I blew them off and they flew away. I interpreted them as twoliars who could emerge after me.' One of them was al-'Ansi and the otherwas Musaylima."<P>4116. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "While I was asleep, I was giventhe treasures of the earth and two gold barcelets were placed in my handand that was hard for me. Then it was revealed to me to blow them off andI blew them off and they vanished. I interpreted them as two liars betweenwhom I am: the master of San'a' and the master of Yamama."<P>4117. It is related that Abu Raja' al-'Utaridi said, "We used to worshipstones, and when we found a better stone than the first stone, we would throwit away and take the other stone. When we did not find any stones, we wouldmake a pile of earth and then bring a sheep and milk the sheep over it andthen did circumambulate it. When the month of Rajab came, we would say, 'Theremover of spear-heads!' and we would not leave any head on a spear or onan arrow. We would remove it and cast it off in the month of Rajab."<P>I heard Abu Raja' said, "I was a boy on the day when the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was sent, grazing camels for my family. Whenwe heard that he had emerged, we fled to the Fire, to Musaylima the Liar."<P><P><B>LXVII: The story of al-Aswad al-'Ansi</B><P>4118. It is related that 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba said, "It reachedus that Musyalima the Liar had arrived in Madina and was staying in the houseof al-Harith's daughter. He was married to the daughter of al-Harith ibnKurayz and she was the mother of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amir. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went up to him with Thabit ibn Qaysibn Shammas. He was the one called the Orator of the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He had a piece of stick in his hand,and he stood before him and spoke to him. Musaylima said to him, 'If youwish, we will keep ourselves clear of you and this business if you then delegateit to us after you.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said, 'Even if you were to ask me for this stick, I would not give it you.I think that you are the one about whom I have been shown what I was shown.This is Thabit ibn Qays who will answer you on my behalf.' Then the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,left."<P>'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah said, "I asked 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas about the dreamof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whichhe mentioned and Ibn 'Abbas said, 'It was mentioned to me that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "While I was asleep,I saw two gold bracelets on my arm and they appalled me and I disliked them.Then I was given permission to blow them off, and I blew them off and theyflew away. I interpreted them as two liars who could emerge." 'Ubaydullahsaid, "One of them was al-'Ansi who was killed by Fayruz in Yemen and theother was Musaylima the Liar."<P><P><B>LXVIII: The story of the people of Najran</B><P>4119. It is related that Hudhayfa said, "Al-'Aqib and as-Sayyid, the rulersof Najran, came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, with the aim of doing a mutual curse." He said, "One of them saidto his companion, 'Don't do it. By Allah, if he is a Prophet and we do themutual curse, then neither we nor our descendants after us will be successful.'They said, 'We will give you what you ask us. Send a trustworthy man withus and only send a trustworthy man with us.' He said, 'I will send you, i.e.over you, a trusty one who is truly trusty.' The Companions of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, were looking and hopingfor it, and he said, 'Get up, Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah.' When he got up,the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Thisis the trustworthy one of this community.'"<P>4120. It is related that Hudhayfa said, "The people of Najran came to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Send a trustworthyman with us.' He said, 'I will send you, i.e. over you, a trusty one whois truly trusty.' The people were looking and hoping for it, and he sentAbu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah."<P>4121. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, "Every community has a trusty one, and the trusty one ofthis community is Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah."<P><P><B>LXIX: The story of 'Uman and Bahrayn</B><P>4122. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, 'If the money of Bahrayn comes, I willgive you such-and-such.' The money of Bahrayn did not come until the Messengerof Allah* had died. When the money of Bahrayn came, Abu Bakr commanded thatit be announced, 'Whoever has a promise with the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, or a debt should come to us.'" Jabir said, "I cameto Abu Bakr and informed him that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, had said, 'If the money of Bahrayn comes, I will give yousuch-and-such.' three times." He said, "He gave to me."<P>Jabir said, "I met Abu Bakr after that and asked him, but he did not giveto me. Then I came to him again and he did ot give to me. Then I came tohim a third time and he did not give to me. I said to you, 'I came to youand you did not gice to me, and then I came to you and you did not give tome, and then I came to you again and you did not give to me. Either giveto me or you are miserly towards me.' He said, 'Did you say, "You are miserlytowards me"? What disease is worse than miserliness!' He said it three times.He said, 'Any time I refused you, I was still meaning to give to you.'"<P>Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was heard to say, "I went to him and Abu Bakr said tome, 'Count it.' I counted it and found that it was five hundred. He said,'Take the same amount twice again.'"<P><P><B>LXX: The arrival of the Ash'arites and the people of Yemen</B><P>Abu Musa said from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"They are from me and I am from them."<P>4123. It is related that Abu Musa said, "I and my brother came from Yemenand we remained for some time thinking that 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud was oneof the men of the family of the house of the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, because they visited and kept to him so often."<P>4124. It is related that Zahdam said, "When Abu Musa arrived, he honouredthis clan of Jarm. I was sitting with him and he was having chicken for lunch.There was a man sitting among the people and he invited him to have lunch,and he said, 'I saw them [the chickens] eating something filthy.' He said,'Come, I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, eat it.'He said, 'I have taken an oath not to eat it.' He said, 'Come and I willinform you about that. We came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, among the group of the Ash'arites, asking him to give us mounts.He refused to give us mounts. Then we asked him again to give us mounts andhe swore that he would not give us mounts. A short time later the the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought some camels as booty.He commanded for us five camels with white humps. When we took them, we said,'We have made the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forgethis oath and we will never be successful after that.' I went to him and said,'Messenger of Allah, you swore that you would not give us mounts and thenyou gave us mounts?' He said, 'Yes, but I will never make an oath and thensee something better than it without doing the thing that is better and doingexpiation for it.'"<P>4125. It is related that 'Imran ibn Husayn said, "The Banu Tamim came tothe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'BanuTamim, rejoice!' They said, 'You have given us good news, so give us something.'The face of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,changed colour. Then some people of Yemen came and he said, 'Accept the goodnews since Banu Tamim have not accepted it.' They said, 'We accept, Messengerof Allah.'"<P>4126. It was related from Abu Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Belief is there," and he pointed towards Yemen."But cruelty and hard-heartedness are in those with loud voices who are followingthe tails of camels where the horns of Shaytan appear - Rabi' and Mudar."<P>4127. It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, &nbsp;may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, "The people of Yemen have come to you. They arethe most kind-hearted and tender-hearted of people. Belief is Yemeni andwisdom is Yemeni. Pride and arrogance are &nbsp;found in the people of camels.Tranquillity is foundwith the people of sheep."<P>It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace.<P>4128. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "Belief is Yemeni and the sedition is over there,over there where the horn of Shaytan appears."<P>["Over there" is to the east.]<P>4129. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "The people of Yemen have come to you, whose heartsare tender [lit. weak] and are kind-hearted. Understanding is Yemeni andwisdom is Yemeni."<P>4130. It is related that 'Alqama said, "We were sitting with Ibn Mas'ud whenKhabbab came and said, 'Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman! Can these lads recite as yourecite?' He said, 'If you like, I will order one of them to recite to you.'He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Recite, 'Alqama!' Zayd ibn Hudayr, the brotherof Ziyad ibn Hudayr, said, 'Have you ordered 'Alqama to recite when he isnot the best reciter of us?' He said, 'If you wish, I will report to youwhat the Prophet. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said about yourpeople and his people.' So I recited fifty ayats of <I>Surat Maryam</I>.'Abdullah asked, 'What do you think?' He answered, 'He did well.' 'Abdullahsaid, 'He recites whatever I recite.' Then he turned to Khabbab who was wearinga gold ring and remarked, 'Is it not time that this ring was discarded?'He said, 'You will not see it on me after today,' and he threw it away."<P>Ghandar related it from Shu'ba.<P><P><B>LXXI: The story of Daws and at-Tufayl ibn 'Amr ad-Dawsi</B><P>4131. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Tufayl ibn 'Amr ad-Dawsi cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Dawsis destroyed. Daws have rebelled and refused, so ask Allah to curse them.'He said, 'O Allah, guide Daws and bring them!'"<P>4132. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When I came to the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, I said on the way:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  'O what a long and tiring night!  <P>  Although it has saved me from the abode of disbelief.'</BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>"A slave of mine had fled on the way. When I came to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, I gave him my allegiance. While I was withhim, the slave appeared. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,said to me, 'O Abu Hurayra, this is your slave.' I said, 'He is free forthe sake of Allah,' and I set him free."<P><P><B>LXXII: The story of the delegation of Tayy, and the hadith of 'Adi ibnHatim</B><P>4133. It is related that Adi ibn Hatim said, "We came to 'Umar in a delegation,and he began to call out man by man by name. I asked, 'Do you not recogniseme, Amir al-Mu'minin?' He said, 'Yes indeed. You became Muslim when theyrejected and you advanced when they retreated and you fulfilled when theybetrayed and you acknowledged when they denied.'" 'Adi said, "Then I do notcare."<P><P><B>LXXIII: The Farewell Pilgrimage</B><P>4134. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We went out with the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for the Farewell Hajj andwe went into <I>ihram</I> for <I>'umra</I>. Then the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Anyone who has a sacrificalanimal with him should go into <I>ihram</I> for <I>hajj</I> and <I>'umra</I>and then should not come out of <I>ihram</I> until completing both.'I reached Makka while I was menstruating and could not do <I>tawaf</I> ofthe House nor run between Safwa and Marwa. I complained about this to theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'Undo yourhair and comb it and go into <I>ihram</I> for hajj and leave <I>'umra</I>.I did that and when we had finished <I>hajj</I>, the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, sent me with 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr to at-Tan'im.'So I did<I> 'umra </I>and he said, 'This is to compensate for the<I> 'umra</I>you missed.'"<P>She said, "Those who had gone into <I>ihram</I> for 'umra of the House didtawaf and went between Safa and Marwa and then came out of ihram. Then theydid another tawaf after they returned from Mina. Those who had combined thehajj and 'umra did only one tawaf."<P>4135. It is related from 'Ata' that Ibn 'Abbas, "If he does <I>tawaf</I>of the House, he comes out of <I>ihram</I>." [Ibn Jurayj] said, "I said,'On what basis does Ibn 'Abbas say this?' He said, 'From the words of AllahAlmighty, <I>"their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House," </I>(22:33)and from the command of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,to his Companions to come out of ihram in the Farewell Pilgrimage.' I said,'That was only after going to 'Arafat.' He said, 'Ibn 'Abbas thought thatit could be both before and after.'"<P>4136. It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said, "I came to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at al-Batha'. He said, 'Are youmaking hajj?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'With what intention did you go into<I>ihram</I>?' I said, 'At your service for the same <I>ihram</I> as thatof the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said,'Do <I>tawaf</I> of the House and go between Safa and Marwa. Then come outof <I>ihram</I>.' I did <I>tawaf</I> of the House and went between Safa andMarwa and went to a woman of Qays who deloused my head."<P>4137. It is related that Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet, reported that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded hiswives to come out of <I>ihram</I> in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage.Hafsa asked, "What prevents you?' He replied, 'I have gummed my hair andgarlanded my sacrificial camels so I will not come out of <I>ihram</I> untilI have sacrificed.'"<P>4138. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas that a woman of Khath'am askingthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for a decisionduring the Farewell Hajj. Al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas was riding behind the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. She said, 'Messenger ofAllah, Allah has imposed an obligation [hajj] on His slaves which appliesto my father who is a very old man and cannot remain firm in his seat whenriding. Can I go on hajj for him?' He said, 'Yes.'"<P>4139. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, came in the year of the Conquest, and Usama was ridingbehind him on al-Qaswa'. Bilal and 'Uthman ibn Talha were with him. He madehis camel kneel near the House and then he said to 'Uthman, 'Bring the key.'He brought the key and opened the door for him. The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, entered with Usama, Bilal and 'Uthman, and thenthey closed the door behind them. He stayed for a long time and then cameout and the people rushed to enter. I was the first of them and I found Bilalstanding behing the door. I asked him, 'Where did the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray?' He said, 'He prayed betweenthese two front columns.' The House was built on six columns in two rows,and he prayed between the two columns of the first row with the door of theHouse behind him, facing the wall which faces one when one enters the House,between him and the wall was three cubits]." He said, "I forgot to ask himhow many rak'ats he prayed. There was a piece of red marble at the placewhere he had prayed."<P>4140. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, reported that Safiyya bint Huyayy, the wife of theProphet, started menstruating in the Farewell Pilgrimage. The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, asked, "Will she delay us?" I replied,"She has come to Makka and has done <I>tawaf</I>." The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "So she can leave."<P>4141. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "We were discussing the FarewellPilgrimage while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wasamong us. We did not know what the Farewell Pilgrimage was. He praised andglorified Allah and then mentioned the Dajjal and described him at length.He said, 'There is no Prophet whom Allah has sent who has not warned hiscommunity of him. Nuh and the Prophets after him warned about him. He willemerge among you. If some of his affair is hidden from you, it is not hiddenfrom you that your Lord is not what is hidden from you,' three times. 'YourLord is not one-eyed, but he is blind in his right eye and his eye is likea swollen grape. Allah has made your blood and property sacred for you likethe sacredness of this day in this land in this month. Have I not conveyedit?' They said, 'Yes.' He said, 'O Allah, I testify,' three times. 'Woe toyou (or 'bother you')! See that you do not revert to being unbelievers afterI have gone, cutting each other's throats.'"<P>4142. It is related from Zayd ibn Arqam that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, went on nineteen expeditions and that he made onepilgrimage after he emigrated and made no pilgrimage after it. That was theFarewell Pilgrimage. Abu Ishaq said that he made another while he was inMakka.<P>4143. It is related from Jarir that the Prophet said to Jarir in the FarewellPilgrimage, 'Tell the people to listen." He said, Do not revert to beingunbelievers after I have gone, cutting each other's throats."<P>4144. It is related that Abu Bakra said that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "Time has continued cyclically in the sameway since the day Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is twelvemonths, four of which are sacred. Three are consecutive: Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l-Hijjaand al-Muharram, and there is Rajab of Mudar which is between Jumada andSha'ban. What month is this?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best."He was silent so that we thought that he might call it something different.He said, "Is this not Dhu'l-Hijja?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "What placeis this?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He was silent sothat we thought that he might call it something different. He said, "Is thisnot the sacred place?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "What day is this?" Wesaid, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He was silent so that we thoughtthat he might call it something different. He said, "Is this not the Dayof Sacrifice?" We said, "Indeed." He said, "Your blood and your property[Muhammad said, "And I think that he also said, 'your honour"] are sacredto you, like the sacredness of this day in this month in this place. Youwill meet your Lord and He will ask you about your actions. So do not revertto misguidance after I have gone, cutting each other's throats. Let thosewho are present convey to those who are absent. Perhaps the one to whom itis conveyed will retain it better than those who heard it." [When Muhammadmentioned it, he used to say, "Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, spoke the truth."] Then he said, "Have I not conveyed it?" twice.<P>4145. It is related from Tariq ibn Shihab that some of the Jews said, "Ifthis <I>ayat</I> had been sent down about us, we would have appointed thatday a festival" 'Umar asked, "What is this <I>ayat</I>?" They said, "Amiral-Mu'minin! There is an ayat you recite in your book which, to us Jews,<I>"Today I have perfected your deen for you and completed My blessing uponyou and am pleased with Islam as a deen for you." </I>(5:3) 'Umar said, "Iknow the place where it was revealed. It was sent down while the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing at 'Arafa."<P>4146. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We set out with the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and some of us went into<I>ihram</I> for 'umra and some of us went into <I>ihram</I> for hajj andsome of us went into <I>ihram</I> for 'umra and hajj. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went into <I>ihram</I> for hajjalone. Those who went into <I>ihram</I> for hajj or combined 'umra and hajjdid not come out of <I>ihram</I> until the Day of Sacrifice."<P>It is related from Malik who said, "With the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, on the Farewell Pilgrimage."<P>Malik related the like of it.<P>4147. It is related that Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, visited me during the Farewell Pilgrimageon account of an illness I had which I feared would prove fatal. I said,'Messenger of Allah, this illness has affected me as you see and I have propertyand no heirs except a single daughter. Shall I give two-thirds of my propertyaway as <I>sadaqa</I>?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Shall I give a half awayas <I>sadaqa</I>?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'A third then?' He said, 'A thirdis a lot. It is better to leave your heirs rich than to leave them poor,begging from other people. There is nothing you spend, desiring by it theface of Allah, but that you will be rewarded, even for a morsel you put inyour wife's mouth.' I said, 'Messenger of Allah, will I be left behind aftermy companions leave?' He said, 'You will not be left behind, for any virtuousactions you do desiring by them the face of Allah will raise you in degreeand elevation. And then you might be left behind so that some people willbenefit from you and others harmed by you. O Allah, let My Companions' completetheir emigration and do not let them turn back on their heels, but poor Sa'dibn Khawla.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,grieved over his death in Makka."<P>4148. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, shaved his head shaved in the Farewell Pilgrimage.<P>4149. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, shaved his head in the Farewell Pilgimageas did some of his Companions while others cut their hair short.<P>4150. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas reported that he came on a donkey whilethe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing,leading the people in prayer at Mina in the Farewell Pilgrimage. The donkeywentin front of one of the rows and then he dismounted from it and joined theprayer line.<P>4151. It is related that 'Urwa said, "Once while I was present, Usama wasasked about the pace of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, in his hajj. He said, 'He travelled at a medium pace and whenhe found a gap, he would go faster.'"<P>4152. It is related from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari that he prayed <I>Maghrib</I>and<I> 'Isha'</I> combined with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, at Muzdalifa during the Farewell Pilgrimage.<P><P><B>LXXIV: The expedition of Tabuk, which is the Expedition of Hardship('Usra)</B><P>4153. It is related that Abu Musa said, "My companions sent me to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to ask him for some mountsfor us since they were with him on the Expedition of Hardship, which wasthe expedition of Tabuk. I said, 'O Prophet of Allah! My companions havesent me to you to ask for mounts.' He said, 'By Allah, I will not give youany mounts!' It happened that when I came to him, he was angry but I wasnot aware of it. I refused sad because of the refusal of the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, and afraid that the Prophet might feelsomething bad towards me. I returned to my companions and told them whatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said. It was buta short time when I heard Bilal calling, 'O 'Abdullah ibn Qays!' and so Ianswered him. Bilal said, 'Respond to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, who is calling you.' When I came to him, he said,'Take these two camels which are tied together and those two camels whichare tied together,' referring to six camels he had bought at that momentfrom Sa'd. He said, 'Take them to your companions. Say: "Allah (or he said,'the Messenger of Allah') provides you with these animals to ride, so ridethem."' I took them to them and said, 'The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, has provided these for you to ride, but, by Allah, I willnot leave you until one of you goes with me to hear what the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, says. Do not suppose thatI relate to you something which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, did not say.' They said, 'By Allah, we consider youto be truthful. We will do what you want.'" So Abu Musa went with a groupof them until they came to those who had heard what the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said refusing them and then hislater giving them. These people related the like of what Abu Musa had related.<P>4154. It is related from Sa'd that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, set out for Tabuk and appointed 'Ali as his deputy.He said, "Are you leaving me behind among the children and women?" He said,"Are you not pleased to be with me in the position that Harun was to Musa,although there will be no Prophet after me?"<P>It is related that it was heard from Mus'ab.<P>4155. It is related that Ya'la ibn Umayya said, "I went on the expeditionof the Army of Hardship (Tabuk) with the Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace." He said, "I think that was one my best deeds." Ya'la said,"An employee of mine fought with a man and one of them closed his teeth onthe other's finger," ('Ata' said, "Safwan informed which of the two bit theother, but I forgot.") He said, "and when he pulled out his finger the other'stooth fell out. They both went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, who denied his claim for compensation for the tooth." 'Ata' said,"I think that he said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, 'Would you rather he had left his finger in your mouth so thatyou could gnaw on it as a stallion gnaws?'"<P><P><B>LXXV: The hadith of Ka'b ibn Malik, and the words of Allah, the Mightyand Exalted <I>"towards the three who were left behind"</I> (9:118)</B><P>4156. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik, who was the one ofKa'b's sons who guided him when he went blind, who said, "I heard Ka'b ibnMalik relate his account of when he stayed behind the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the expedition to Tabuk. Ka'bsaid, 'I did not stay behind the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, on any another expedition he made at all, except forthe Tabuk expedition, although I did not go on the expedition to Badr. Noone censured anyone for staying behind that, because the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set out heading for the caravanof Quraysh until Allah Almighty brought them together with their enemyunexpectedly. I was present with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, on the night of 'Aqaba when we made a compact onIslam and I would not want to exchange that for having been present at Badr.even though Badr is more renowned than it among the people.<P>"'Part of my account of when I stayed behind the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, on the expedition to Tabuk was thatI had never been either stronger or wealthier than when I stayed behind himon this expedition. By Allah, before it I had never had two riding animalsas I did have when that expedition took place. When the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, intended to go on an expedition,he would always indicate another destination until the expedition actuallyleft. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, madethis one at a time of intense heat and there was a long journey in prospectand a waterless desert, and a great enemy to face. Therefore he made thewhole thing quite clear to the Muslims so that they could make the necessarypreparations for the expedition. He told them the direction in which he wasintending to go. The Muslims with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, were numerous and a recording book (meaning a register)was incapable of including all of them.'<P>"Ka'b said, 'Anyone wanting to absent himself thought that his absence wouldgo unnoticed as long as no revelation was sent down about him from Allah.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made thatexpedition when the fruit was ripe and there was plentiful shade and I inclinedtowards it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and the Muslims with him made preparations, and I would go out to makepreparations with him as well, but then I would return without havingaccomplished anything, saying to myself, "I can do it any time I wish." Iwent on like this until the people were fully prepared, and the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set out with the Muslimsbut I had still not completed any of my preparations. Then I began and againreturned without accomplishing anything. I continued like this until theyhad gone on ahead and the expedition had left. I intended to set off andcatch up with them, and I wish that I had done so, but that was not decreedfor me. When I went out among the people after the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, had left, it saddened me that the onlypeople like me were either men suspected of hypocrisy or men whom Allah Almightyhad excused on account of their being among the weak.<P>"'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did notmention me until he reached Tabuk. While he was sitting among the peopleat Tabuk, he said, "What has Ka'b ibn Malik done?" A man of the Banu Salimasaid, "O Messenger of Allah, he has been held back by his two cloaks andself-conceit.' Mu'adh ibn Jabal said to him, "What an evil thing to say!By Allah, Messenger of Allah, we only know good of him!" The Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was silent.'<P>"Ka'b ibn Malik said, 'When I heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, was on his return journey from Tabuk, I becamevery upset and began to think up lies and to say, "How can I escape his angertomorrow!" and I consulted everyone among my family capable of giving soundadvice for help in respect of that. When it was said that the Messenger ofAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was arriving, all falsehoodleft me as I knew that nothing which contained any falsehood would ever saveme from him. I resolved to stick to the truth. The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, arrived in the morning. Whenever hecame back from a journey, he would first go to the mosque and pray two<I>rak'ats </I>in it and then he would sit to receive the people. When hedid that, those who had stayed behind went to him making their excuses andswearing to them. There were about eighty men. He accepted what they declaredand took their allegiance and asked forgiveness for them and entrusted theirsecrets to Allah. Then I came. When I greeted him, he smiled the smile ofsomeone who is angry and then he said, "Come here." I walked up and thensat down in front of him. He said to me, "What kept you back? Had you notbought a mount?" I said, 'Yes. Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I were sittingwith anyone else in the world apart from you, I would think that I couldescape his anger by making some excuse. I am gifted in argumentation, but,by Allah, I know that if I were to tell you a false story today which mightsatisfy you with regard to me, Allah would soon make you angry with me. IfI tell you the truth, you will be angry with me, but I hope for a good outcomefrom Allah, the Mighty and Exalted. By Allah, I do not have any excuse. ByAllah, I have never been stronger nor wealthier than when I remained behindyou."'<P>"'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"This one has spoken the truth. Get up until Allah decides about you." Somemen of the Banu Salima followed me and said to me, "By Allah, we have notknown you to commit a sin before this! Were you unable to offer an excuseto the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, likethe others who stayed behind made excuses? The Messenger of Allah's prayerfor forgiveness would have compensated for your sin. By Allah, they continuedto reproach me until I wanted to return to the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and deny what I had said. Then I said to them,"Has anyone else met with the same as me?" They said, "Yes, two men havemet with it. They said the same as you said and the same thing that was saidto you was said to them."' He said, 'I said, "Who are they?" They said, "Muraraibn ar-Rabi' al-'Amiri and Hilal ibn Umayya al-Waqifi." They mentioned tome two righteous men who had been present at Badr and had good character.When they mentioned them to me, I was determined.'<P>"'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbadepeople to speak to the three of us out of all those who had remained behindhim. So the people avoided us and changed towards us until the earth seemedstrange to me and it was not the same earth I used to know. We remained thatway for fifty days. My two companions were miserable and stayed in theirhomes, weeping. I was the youngest of them, and I was the toughest of them.I used to go out and attend the prayer with the Muslims and I would walkin the markets but no one would speak to me. I went to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and greeted him while he was inhis assembly after the prayer and would say to myself, "Did he move his lipsto return the greeting or not?" Then I would pray near him and sneak a lookat him and he would look at me while I attended to my prayer, but when Iturned towards him, he would turn away from me. When that harshness of theMuslims went on too long a time for me, I climbed over the wall of Abu Qatada'sgarden. He was my cousin and the dearest of people to me. I greeted him,and, by Allah, he did not return the greeting to me. I said to him, "AbuQatada, I ask you by Allah, do you not know that I love Allah and His Messenger?"He was silent, and I repeated my adjuration and he was still silent. I againrepeated my adjuration and he said, "Allah and His Messenger know best."My eyes overflowed with tears and I turned and climbed back over the wall.<P>"He said, 'While I was walking in the market of Madina, a farmer from thepeople of Syria, who had brought some food to sell in Madina, said, "Whowill direct me to Ka'b ibn Malik?" The people began to point me out to himuntil he came up to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan. Iwas a scribe and so I read it. It said, "Following on from that: it has reachedus that your companion has been harsh to you. Allah has not put you in aplace to be humiliated and deprived. Join us and we will console you." WhenI had read it, I said, "This is also part of the test," and I took it tothe oven and burned it in it.<P>"'When forty of the fifty days had passed and revelation was still delayed,a messenger from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, came to me and said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, commands you to withdraw from your wife." I said, "AmI to divorce her or what am I to do?" He said, "No, just withdraw from herand do not go near her." He sent the same message to my two companions. Isaid to my wife, "Join your family and stay with them until Allah decidesabout this business."'<P>"Ka'b said, 'The wife of Hilal ibn Umayya went to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said to him, "Messenger of Allah,Hilal ibn Umayya is an old man unable to look after himself and he has noservant. Would you dislike me serving him?" He said, "No, but do not lethim come near you." She said, "By Allah, he has no impulse for anything.By Allah, he has remained weeping since the day of this business starteduntil today." Some of my family said to me, "You should ask permission fromthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for yourwife. He gave permission to the wife of Hilal ibn Umayya to serve him." Isaid, "I will not ask the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, for permission for her. How do I know what the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would say if I asked his permissionbeing a young man!" I remained like that for ten days, and fifty days werecompleted from the time when speaking to us was first prohibited.<P>"'Then on the morning after the fiftieth night, I prayed <I>Fajr</I> on topof one of our houses. While I was sitting in the grip of the state whichAllah Almighty mentioned about us, my self being constricted and the earthseeming narrow for me after it had been wide, I heard someone shouting atthe top of his voice from the top of Sal': "Ka'b ibn Malik, good news foryou!" I fell down in prostration and knew that relief had come. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, announced to the peoplethe turning of Allah towards us after he had prayed the Fajr prayer. Thepeople came to bring us the good news. They went to my two companions tobring them the good news. One man spurred on his horse to reach me and oneof Aslam ran towards me and climbed the mountain. The voice reached me quickerthan the horse. When the one whose voice I had heard came to me to give methe good news, I removed my garments and put them on him because of the goodnews he had brought. By Allah, that day I had no other garments than those.I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to go before the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Crowds of people met meto congratulate me on Allah's turning towards me. They were saying to me,"Enjoy the turning of Allah towards you!"' Ka'b said, 'Until I entered themosque. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was sitting surrounded by people. Talha ibn 'Ubaydullah got up, hurryingto shake my hand and congratulate me. By Allah, not one of the Muhajriungot up except him. I will never forget what Talha did.'<P>"Ka'b said, 'When I greeted the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, his face was shining with joy and he said, "Rejoice in thebest day that has come to you since your mother bore you!"' He said, 'I said,"Is it from you, Messenger of Allah, or from Allah?" He said, "No, indeedit is from Allah!" When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, was happy, his face used to shine as if it were a part of themoon. We used to recognise that in him. When I sat down in front of him,I said, 'Messenger of Allah, part of my repentance is that I divest myselfof my property as sadaqa for Allah and His Messenger." The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Keep part of your propertyfor yourself. That will be better for you." So I said, "I will keep my shareat Khaybar." I said, "Messenger of Allah, Allah has saved me on account ofbeing truthful, and part of my repentance is that I will speak nothing butthe truth for as long as I live." By Allah, I do not know of anyone amongthe Muslims whom Allah has tried in truthfulness more. I have not inclinedto a lie from the time I said that to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, until this very day, and I hope that Allah Almightywill protect me during what remains of my life.'<P>"He said, 'Allah then sent down, <I>"Allah has turned towards the Prophet,and the Muhajirun and the Ansar, </I>- to - <I>Fear Allah and be with thetruthful."</I> (9:117-119) 'By Allah, after Allah guided me to Islam, Allahdid not bestow on me any blessing greater than my truthfulness to the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the fact that I didnot lie to him and get destroyed as those who lied were destroyed. When therevelation was sent down, Allah Almighty said about those who lied, the worstthing He said about anyone. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, said, <I>"Theywill swear to you by Allah when you return to them, so that you leave themalone </I>- to - <I>Allah is certainly not pleased with degenerate people."</I>(9:95-96)'<P>"Ka'b said, "We three were left apart from those whose excuses had been acceptedby the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whenthey swore to them and whose allegiance he took and for whom he askedforgiveness. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,deferred the matter of us until Allah decided about it and Allah said, "tothe three who were left behind" and what He mentioned was not our stayingback from the expedition but his leaving us and deferring our matter beyondthat of the others who stayed behind and made excuses to him which he accepted.'"<P><P><B>LXXVI: The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, alightingat al-Hijr</B><P>4157. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that when the Prophet passed by al-Hijr,he said, "Do not enter places of people who wronged themselves unless youare weeping lest what befell them befalls you." Then he covered his headand hastened his pace until he crossed the valley.<P>4158. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace,said to to his companions at al-Hijr,"Do not enter places of people who wronged themselves unless you are weepinglest what befell them befalls you."<P>4159. It is related that al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said, "The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, went out to relieve himself. I went to pourthe water for him." 'Urwa said, "I only remember that he said it was in theTabuk expedition." "So he washed his face and began to wash his forearms,but the sleeves of the jubbah were tight and he brought his arms out fromunder his jubbah and washed them. Then he wiped over his leather socks."<P>4160.

It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, returned from the Tabuk expedition andapproached Madina and said, "In Madina there are people who have been withyou whatever distance you have travelled and whatever valley you crossed.'They said, "Messenger of Allah, even though they are in Madina?"

He commanded him to give it to the governorof Bahrayn and the governor of Bahrayn should give it to Chosroes. When Chosroesread it, he tore it up. Ibn Shihab reckoned that Ibn al-Musayyab said, "TheMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, invoked on themthat they would be torn to pieces."<P>4163. It is related that Abu Bakra said, "During the days of the Battle ofthe Camel, Allah benefited me with a word which I heard from the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

It is related from Sa'id ibn Jubayr about Ibn 'Abbas , "'Umar ibnal-Khattab used to bring Ibn 'Abbas close to him and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awfsaid to him, 'We have sons like him.' He answered, 'He is from where youknow.' So 'Umar asked Ibn 'Abbas about this <I>ayat, 'When Allah's help andvictory have arrived.' </I>(110:1) and he said, 'It is the term of the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about which he is beinginformed.' He said, 'I only know what you know of it.'"<P>4168. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Thursday! What was Thursday! Thepain of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,became intense and he said, 'Bring me some sheets so that I may write a documentfor you after which you will never go astray.' They quarrelled, and thereshould be no quarrelling in the presence of a Prophet, and they said, 'Whatis wrong with him? He is delirious. Question him!' They returned to him andhe said, 'Leave me, for that which I am in is better than that to which youcall me.' He gave them three instructions: 'Expel the idolaters from theArabian peninsula, give presents to the delegations as you have seen me givingthem presents.'" He was silent about the third, or he said, "I forgot it."<P>4169. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was near death and there were some menin the house, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,'Come! I will write for you something after which you will never go astray.'Some of them said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, is overcome with pain. We have the Qur'an and the Book of Allahis enough for us.' So the people in the house disagreed and argued. Someof them said, 'Bring him what he needs to write something for you after whichyou will never go astray,' and some of them said the reverse. When the hubbuband disagreement increased, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, said, 'Get up.'"<P>'Ubaydullah said that Ibn 'Abbas used to say, "A complete disaster. Onlytheir disagreement and hubbub came between the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, and writing that document for them."<P>4170. It is related that 'A&Otilde;isha said, &Ograve;The Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, summoned Fatima, peace be upon her, in hisfinal illness. He confided something to her and she wept. Then he calledher and confided something to her and she laughed. We asked her about thatand she said, 'She confided him that he would die in the illness in whichhe died and so I wept. Then he confided to me and informed me that I wouldbe the first of his family to follow him and I laughed.'"<P>4171. It is related that 'A'isha said, "I used to hear him say, 'No Prophetdies until he is given a choice between this world and the Next.' I heardthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say in the illnessin which he died, while his voice was becoming hoarse, <I>'"With those whomAllah has blessed:.." (4:69)' So I thought that he had been given achoice."</I><P><I> </I>4172. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, became ill in the illness from which he died,he began to say, 'With the Highest Companion.'"<P><A HREF="muw5.html#47">4173</A>. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in good health, heused to say, 'No Prophet dies until he sees his seat in the Garden, and thenis made to live or is given a choice.' When he was ill and near death andhis head was on the thigh of 'A'isha, he fainted and when he recovered, hiseyes were fixed on the roof of the house and then he said, "O Allah, withthe Highest Companion.' I said, 'Then he is not going to be near us!' andI recognised that it was what he had said when he was healthy."<P>4174. It is related that 'A'isha said, "'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr cameto the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while I was supportinghim on my chest. 'Abdu'r-Rahman had a fresh siwak with which he was cleaninghis teeth. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,looked at it, so I took the siwak and chewed it, cut it, and cleaned it andthen gave it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andhe cleaned his teeth with it. I have never seen the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, clean his teeth in a better manner thanit. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,finished, he lifted his hand or finger and then said, 'With the HighestCompanion,' three times. Then he died." She used to say, "He died betweenmy throat and chest."<P>4175. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, was ill, he would spit his breath onhimself after reciting the two <I>suras</I> of refuge and then rub himselfwith his hand. When he was ill with the illness from which he died, I beganto blow on him after the two <I>suras</I> of refuge and then rub the handof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, over him."<P><A HREF="muw5.html#46">4176</A>. It is related that 'A'isha reported thatshe heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and listenedto him say before he died, while he was leaning his back against her, "OAllah, forgive me, and have mercy on me, and join&nbsp;me to the HighestCompanion."<P>4177. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said in his illness from which he did not recover, "Allahcursed the Jews and the Christians. They took the graves of their Prophetsas mosques." 'A'isha said, "If it had not been for that, his grave wouldhave been given prominence, but he feared that it might be made into a mosque."<P>4178. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "When the illness of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, became severe and his pain was intense, heasked his wives for permission to be nursed in my room and they gave himtheir permission. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, came out between two men, his feet dragging on the ground - between'Abbas and another man.<P>'Ubaydullah said, "I told 'Abdullah was 'A'isha had said and 'Abdullah ibn'Abbas said to me, 'Do you know who the other man was whom 'A'isha did notname?' I said, 'No.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'It was 'Ali ibn Abi Talib.'"<P>'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, used to relate, "After the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, entered my house, and his pain became more intense,he said : 'Pour over me seven unopened water skins so I can counsel the people.'We seated him in a tub belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace. Then we started pouring those water skinsover him until he indicated to stop as we had done enough. Then he went outto the people, led them in the prayer and addressed them."<P>4179. It is reported that 'A'isha and 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said, "When theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was dying, hebegan pulling his <I>khamisa</I> (blanket) over his face but when he feltsuffocated by it, he removed it from his face and at that point he said,'May the curse of Allah be upon the Jews and the Christians who took thegraves of their Prophets as places of worship.' He was warning against whatthey had done."<P>4180. It is reported that 'A'isha said, "I spoke repeatedly with the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about that and my repeatingwas only caused by the fact that it did not occur to my heart that the peoplewould ever love a man after him who stood in his place. I thought that anyonewho stood in his place would be taken by the people as a bad omen and thereforeI wanted to divert the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, from Abu Bakr.<P>Ibn 'Umar, Abu Musa and Ibn 'Abbas related it from the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace.<P>4181. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, died when he was between my chest and my chin, so Ido not dislike the intensity of death for anyone after the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace."<P>4182. It is related from Ka'b ibn Malik, who was one of the three to whomAllah turned that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas informed him that 'Ali ibn Abi Talibemerged from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,in his illness from which he died and the people said, "O Abu'l-Hasan! Howis the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, thismorning?" He replied, "Praise be to Allah, he is well this morning." 'Abbasibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib took him by the hand and said to him, "By Allah, inthree days time you will be a subject. By Allah, I think that the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, will die of this illnessof him. I recognise the faces of the Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib when they aredying. Let us go to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, and ask him who will have this authority. If it is in us, thenwe will know that, and if it is for other than us, we will know it and hecan advise him to look after us." 'Ali said, "By Allah, if we asked the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for it and he refusedus, then the people would never give it to us afterwards. By Allah, I willnot ask it from the Messenger of Allah."<P>4183. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "While the Muslims were inthe <I>Fajr</I> prayer on Monday and Abu Bakr was leading them in the prayer,the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, suddenlylifted the curtain of 'A'isha's room and looked at them while they were intheir prayer lines and then he smiled. Abu Bakr retreated backwards to jointhe row, thinking that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, wanted to come out for the prayer." Anas said, "The were aboutto be tested in their prayer out of joy at the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, indicated to them with his hand, 'Complete your prayer,'and let the curtain drop."<P>4184. It is related that 'A'isha used to say, "One of the facours of Allahto me was that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, died in my room and on my day and between my lungs and throat, andAllah joined my saliva with his when he died. 'A'isha came to me with a siwakin his hand while I was supporting the Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. I saw him looking at it and I knew that he likedthe siwak, so I said, 'Shall I take it for you?' He nodded his head in assent.So I took it and it was too hard for him and I said, 'Shall I soften it foryou?' He nodded his head in assent. So I softened and cleaned his teeth withit, In front of him was a vessel or a container ('Umar was unsure.) containingsome water. He began to put his hands in the water and wipe his face withthem, saying, 'There is no god but Allah. Death has agonies.' Then he raisedhis hand and began to say, 'O Prophet, with the Highest Companion,' untilhe died and his hand dropped."<P>4185. It is related from 'A'isha that in his fatal illness, the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to ask, "Where willI be tomorrow? Where will I be tomorrow?" wanting the day of 'A'isha. Hiswives gave him permission to be where he wished, so he was in the room of'A'isha until he died with her. 'A'isha said, "He died in the day which wasmy turn in my room. Allah took him while his head was between my throat andlungs, and his saliva was mixed with my saliva." Then she said, "'Abdu'r-Rahmanibn Abi Bakr entered with a siwak which he was using to clean his teeth.The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked atit and I said to him, 'Give me this siwak, 'Abdu'r-Rahman.' He gave it tome and I cut it, and then chewed it and gave it to the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,and he cleaned his teeth with itwhile he was leaning against my chest."<P>4186. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, died in my room and on my day and between my lungs andthroat, and one of us used to seek refuge for him with a supplication whenhe was ill, so I began I seek refuge for him. He raised his head to the skyand said, 'With the Highest Companion, with the Highest Companion.''Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr passed by with amoist date-palm in his hand andthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked at it and Ithought that he had need of it, so I took it and chewed the tip of it andshook it and gave it to him. He cleaned his teeth with it in the best wayhe had ever cleaned his teeth. Then he gave it to me and then his hand fell,or it dropped from his hand. So Allah joined my saliva and his saliva onhis last day in this world and the first day of the Next world."<P>4187. It is related that 'A'isha reported that Abu Bakr arrived on his horsefrom his house in Sunh. He dismounted and entered the mosque and did notspeak to anyone before coming to 'A'isha. He went to the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, who was covered with a a Yemeni cloth.anduncovered his face. He bent over him and kissed him and then wept, saying,'May my father and mother be your ransom, O Prophet of Allah! Allah willnot make you die two deaths. You have died the death which was written foryou."<P>It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas that Abu Bakr and 'Umar ibn al-Khattabwent out and spoke to the people. He said, "Sit down, 'Umar," but 'Umar refusedto sit down. The people came to him and left 'Umar. Abu Bakr said, "Followingon from that: Any among you who worship Muhammad, should know that Muhammadhas died. Any who worship Allah, should know that Allah is alive and cannever die. Allah says, <I>'Muhammad is only a Messenger a nd he has beenpreceded by other Messengers. If he was to die or be killed, would you turnon your heels? Those who turn on their heels do not harm Allah in any way.Allah will recompense the thankful.'</I> (3:144)" He said, "By Allah, Itwas as if the people had not known that Allah had revealed this until AbuBakr recited it. All the people took it from him and there was no one whowas not heard reciting it."<P>Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab reported that 'Umar said, "By Allah, when I heard AbuBakr reciting it, I was floored so that my legs could not hold me and untilI fell down to the ground when I heard him recite it. I knew that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had died."<P>4188. It is related from 'A'isha and Ibn 'Abbas that Abu Bakr kissed theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after his death.<P>4189. It is related that 'A'isha said, "We poured medicine in a corner ofhis mouth while he was ill and he began to indicate to us, 'Do not pour medicinein my mouth.' We said, 'It is the dislike of the sick person for medicine.'When he came around, he said, 'Did I not forbid you to pour medicine in mymouth?' We said, 'It is the dislike of the sick person for medicine.' Hesaid, 'Let everyone in the house have medicine poured in his mouth whileI am looking, except for Al-'Abbas, who was not present with you.'"<P>It is related from 'A'isha from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace....<P>4190. It is related from al-Aswad that it was mentioned in the presence of'A'isha that 'Ali was appointed by will. She demanded, "Who said that? TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was leaning against mychest and he called for a basin and then he went limp and died while I wasnot aware of it, so when did he appoint 'Ali?"<P>4191. It is related that Talha said, "I asked 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa whetherthe Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made a will. He said,'No.' I asked, 'So how was the will prescribed for people (or were theyprescribed to make the will)?' He said, 'He bequeathed the Book of Allah.'"<P>4192. It is related that 'Amr ibn al-Harith said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left neither dinar nor dirham norslave nor slavegirl nor anything other than his white mule which he usedto ride, his weapons, and some land that he made <I>sadaqa</I> for travellers."<P>4193. It is related that Anas said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, was very ill, the pain began to make him faint. Fatima,peace be upon her, said,.'Have you more pain, father?' He said to her, 'Aftertoday your father will suffer no more pain.' When he died, she said, 'Father,your Lord has answered your prayer. Father, the Garden of Firdaws is yourshelter. Father, shall we announce your death to Jibril?' When he was buried,Fatima, peace be upon her, said, 'Anas, are you happy to put dust on theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?'"<P><P><B>LXXIX: The last words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace</B><P>4194.
