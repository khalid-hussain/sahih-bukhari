The Book of Dress</BIG></B><P><P>The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Say: 'Who has forbidden the fine clothingof Allah and the good kinds of provision He has produced for His slaves?'"(</I>7:32)<P>The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Eat and drink,dress and give <I>sadaqa</I> without extravagance and without arrogance."<P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "Eat what you like. Wear what you like as long as that isfree of two: extravagance or arrogance."<P>5446. Nafi', 'Abdullah ibn Dinar and Zayd ibn Aslam reported from Ibn 'Umarthat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"Allah will not look at someone who trails his garment out of arrogance."<P><P><B>I. The one who trailed his wrapper without arrogance</B><P>5447. Salim ibn 'Abdullah related from his father ('Abdullah ibn 'Umar) thatthe Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone trailshis garment out of arrogance, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Rising."Abu Bakr said, "Messenger of Allah, one side of my waist wrapper hangs downif I do not attend to that." The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, said, "You are not one of those who do it out of arrogance."<P>5448. Al-Hasan related that Abu Bakra said, "There was a solar eclipse whilewe were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He gotup trailing his garment in haste and went to the mosque. The people returnedand he prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> and then the eclipse cleared. Then he facedus and said, "The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. If yousee something from them, you should pray and make supplication to Allah untilit clears."<P><P><B>II. Rolling or tucking up the garment</B><P>5449. Abu Juhayfa said, "I saw Bilal bring an short staff and set it upright.Then he said the <I>iqama</I> for he prayer. I saw the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, come out in a cloak which was rolledup. He prayed two <I>rak'ats</I> facing the staff. I saw the people and animalspassing in front of him beyond the staff."<P><P><B>III. What is lower than the ankles is in the Fire</B><P>5450. Sa'id ibn Abi Sa'id al-Maqburi related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "That part of the waist wrapperwhich is lower than the ankles is in the Fire."<P><P><B>IV. The one who trailed his garment out of arrogance</B><P>5451. Al-A'raj transmitted from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of Rising Allah will not lookat someone who trails his wrapper out of arrogance."<P>5452. Muhammad ibn Ziyad related, "I heard Abu Hurayra say, "The Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said (or Abu'l-Qasim, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said), 'While a man was walking in a robe,proud of himself, with his hair well-groomed, Allah caused the earth to swallowhim up and he will go on sinking into it until the Day of Rising.'"<P>5453. Salim ibn 'Abdullah related from his father, 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, thatthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whilea man was trailing his waist wrapper, the earth swallowed him up and he goon sinking into the earth until the Day of Rising."<P>It is corroborated by Yunus from az-Zuhri. Shu'ayb does not have it<I> marfu'</I>from az-Zuhri.<P>5454. Jarir ibn Zayd said, "I was with Salim ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar at thedoor of his house and he said, "Abu Hurayra say that he heard the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say the like."<P>5455. Shu'ba said, "I met Muharib ibn Dithar* on a horse while he was goingto the place where he sat to give judgement, I asked him about this hadithand he related it to me and said, 'I heard 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar say that theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "If anyonetrails his garment out of arrogance, Allah will not look at him on the Dayof Rising."' I asked Muharib, 'Did he mention his waist wrapper?' He answered,'He did not specify the waist wrapper or the shirt.'"<P>[*He was a qadi who used to sit in a corner of the mosque in Kufa to givejudgement.]<P>Jabala ibn Suhaym, Zayd ibn Aslam, and Zayd ibn 'Abdullah corroborated itfrom Salim from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace.<P>Al-Layth transmitted the like from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar.<P>Musa ibn 'Uqba, 'Umar ibn Muhammad and Qudama ibn Musa corroborated it fromSalim from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, as, "Whoever trails his garment out of pride."<P><P><B>V. The fringed waist-wrapper</B><P>It is mentioned that az-Zuhri, Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad, Hamza ibn Abi Usaydand Mu'awiya ibn 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far wore fringed garments.<P>5456. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr related that 'A'isha said, "The wife of Rifa'aal-Qurazi came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant himpeace, while I was sitting there and Abu Bakr was with him. She said, "Iwas married to Rifa'a and he divorced me and it was a final divorce. I thenmarried 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn az-Zubayr, but he is like this fringe, and shetook hold of the fringe of her outer wrapper (<I>jilbab</I>). Khalid ibnSa'id, who was at the door and had not been given permission to enter, heardwhat she said and said, 'Abu Bakr, will you not stop this woman from sayingthat openly in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace?' By Allah, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, did not do more than smile. The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, 'Do you want to returnto Rifa'a? No, not until you have enjoyed his sweetness and he ('Abdu'r-Rahman)has enjoyed your sweetness.' That has become the sunna ever since.*"<P>[*The <I>sunna</I> is that she cannot return to her first husband who divorcedher with a final divorce until she has consummated a marriage with anotherhusband.]<P><P><B>VI. Cloaks <I>(rida'</I>)</B><P>Anas said, "A bedouin pulled the cloak of the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace."<P>5457. Husayn ibn 'Ali related that 'Ali said, "The Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, called for his cloak and put it it on and set outwalking wearing it. Zayd ibn Haritha and I followed him until he reachedthe house where Hamza was. They asked for permission to enter and were givenpermission."<P><P><B>VII. Wearing long shirts</B><P>The words of Allah Almighty reporting from Yusuf, <I>"Go with this shirtof mine and cast it on my father's face and he will see again."</I> (12:93)<P>5458. Nafi' related from Ibn 'Umar that a man said, "Messenger of Allah,what find of clothes should someone in <I>ihram</I> wear?" The Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Someone in <I>ihram</I> shouldnot wear a shirt, trousers, burnoose or leather socks. If he does not havesandals, then he should cut them (the socks) and wear what comes below theankles."<P>5459. 'Amr heard Jabir ibn 'Abdullah say, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, came after 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy had been put into hisgrave. He commanded that he be brought out and placed on his knees. He blewsome of his spit on him (<I>nafth</I>) and clothed him in his shirt, andAllah knows best."<P>5460. Nafi' related from 'Abdullah said, "When 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy died,his son came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andsaid, 'Messenger of Allah, give me your shirt so I can shroud him in it.Pray over him and ask forgiveness for him.' So the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, gave him his shirt and said, 'Inform me when youfinish so that I can pray over him.' When he finished, he told him and hecame to pray over him. 'Umar pulled him away and said, 'Has not Allah forbiddenyou to pray over the hypocrites?' He said, <I>'"You can ask forgiveness forthem, or not ask forgiveness for them. Even if you asked forgiveness forthem seventy times, Allah still would not forgive them.</I>" (9:80)' Thenit was revealed, <I>"Do not ever pray over any of them who die or stand attheir graves.' </I>(9:84) Then he stopped praying over them."<P><P><B>VIII. The <I>jayb</I> (opening) of the shirt on the chest and elsewhere</B><P>5461. Tawus related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, made an example, saying, "The likeness ofthe miser and the one who gives is like two men wearing shirts of chain-mailand their hands are tied to their breasts to their collar bones. When thegiver of sadaqa spends, his shirt expands over his body until it covers hisfingertips and obliterates his footsteps. When the miser wants to spend anything,it shrinks and every link is fixed in its place." Abu Hurayra said, "I sawthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, illustratingthat with his finger like this in the neck of the shirt. If only you couldsee him trying to make it looser but it will not get looser."<P>Ibn Tawus corroborated it from his father and Abu'z-Zinad from al-A'raj aboutthe two shirts (definite).<P>Hanzala said, "I heard Abu Hurayra mention the two coats in the indefiniteform."<P>Ja'far related the indefinite form from al-A'raj.<P><P><B>IX. The one who wore a coat (jubbah) with narrow sleeves while on ajourney</B><P>5462. Masruq related that al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to relieve himself. Thenhe faced qibla and I brought the water and he did wudu'. He was wearing aSyrian coat. He washed his mouth and snuffed water up his nose and washedhis face. He tried to put his hand through his sleeves, but they were tootight and so he brought them out from underneath and washed them and wipedhis head and over his leather socks."<P><P><B>X. Wearing a woollen coat (jubbah) during expeditions</B><P>5463. It is related from 'Urwa ibn al-Mughira that his father said, "I waswith the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey onenight and he asked, 'Do you have any water with you?' 'Yes,' I answered.He got off his camel and went off until he disappeared in the darkness ofthe night. Then he came back and I poured water for him from the <I>wudu'</I>vessel. He washed his face and hands. He was wearing a woollen coat andcould not get his fore-arms out of it and so he brought them out from underneaththe cloak. He washed his forearms and then wiped his head. Then I went toremove his leather socks then he said, 'Leave them. I was in a state of puritywhen I put them on.' Then he wiped over them."<P><P><B>XI. The coat <I>(qaba'</I>) and the silk <I>farruj</I></B><P>The <I>farruj</I> is a type of <I>qaba'</I> and it is said that it is onewhich which has a slit at the back.<P>[A sleeved, close-fitting coat like a qaftan, divided down the fruit.]<P>5464. Ibn Abi Mulayka related that al-Miswar ibn Makhrama said, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, divided up some coats,but did not give any of them to Makhrama. Makhrama said, 'My son, come withme to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' Iwent with him and he said, 'Go in and call him to me.'" He said, 'I calledhim to him and he came out to him wearing one of the cloaks. He said, 'Wekept this for you.'" He said, "He looked at it and said, 'Makhrama is pleased.'*"<P>[Ibn Hajar said that Makhrama said this. It is also said that the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said it.]<P>5465. Abu'l-Khayr related that 'Uqba ibn 'Amir said, "The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was given a silk <I>farruj</I> whichhe put on and then he prayed wearing it. When he finished, he wrenched itoff violently as if he disliked it and then said, 'This is not proper forthose who have fear of Allah!'"<P>'Abdullah ibn Yusuf corroborated it from al-Layth. Another said that it isa silk <I>farruj</I>.<P><P><B>XII. Burnooses (hooded cloaks)</B><P>Mu'tamir said, "I heard my father say, 'I saw Anas wearing a yellow burnoosemade of khazz*."<P>5466. Nafi' related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that a man said, "Messengerof Allah, what does someone in <I>ihram</I> wear?" The Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not wear a shirt, turban,trousers, burnoose or leather socks. If someone cannot find sandals, thenhe can wear leather socks which should cut below the ankles. Do not wearclothing which has been touched by saffron or wars."<P>[*Khazz is either a mixture of silk and wool or it is also said to entirelymade of silk. Wars is a type of yellow dye and saffron is yellowish red.They also have a scent.]<P><P><B>XIII. Trousers</B><P>5467. Jabir ibn Zayd related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone does not have a waist-wrapper,he should wear trousers. If someone cannot find sandals he should wear leathersocks."<P>5468. Nafi' related that 'Abdullah said. "A man said, Messenger of Allah,what do you command us to wear when we are in <I>ihram</I>?' He answered,'Do not wear shirts, trousers, uncles, burnooses, or leather locks. If aman has no sandals, he should wear leather socks cut below the ankles, andshould not wear any garments which have been touched with any saffron orwars.'"<P><P><B>XIV. Turbans</B><P>5469. Salim reported from his father that the Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, said, "The one in <I>ihram</I> should not wear a shirt,turban, trousers, burnoose, nor a garment touched by saffron or wars, norleather socks except in the case of someone who does not have sandals. Ifhe does not have them, then he cuts off the leather socks below the ankles."<P><P><B>XV. Covering the face</B><P>Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cameout with a oily cloth around his head."<P>Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with hishead bandaged with the end of a cloak."<P>5470. 'Urwa related that 'A'isha said, "Some people emigrated to Madina andAbu Bakr prepared to emigrate. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, said, 'Take your time. I hope to be given permission.' Abu Bakrsaid, 'My father be your ransom, do you hope for that?' He said, 'Yes.' ThereforeAbu Bakr kept himself back in order to accompany the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. He fed two riding-camels he had on acacia leaveswhich had been knocked off with a stick for four months."<P>'Urwa said that 'A'isha said, "While we were sitting in our house aroundmidday, someone said to Abu Bakr, 'This is the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, coming with his head covered at a time atwhich he did not used to come to us. Abu Bakr said, 'May my father and motherbe his ransom, by Allah, he has only come at this hour because somethinghas happened.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cameand asked for permission to enter and was given permission and he entered.When he entered, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saidto Abu Bakr, 'Send out those who are with you.' He said, 'They are my family,Messenger of Allah, may my father be your ransom!'. He said, 'I have beengiven permission to leave.' He asked, 'In company, may my father and motherbe your ransom, Messenger of Allah?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace, said, 'Yes.' Abu Bakr said, 'Take one of these twoshe-camels, Messenger of Allah, may my father be your ransom.' The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'I will take itfor a price.'"<P>She said, "We prepared what they needed for the journey as quickly as possibleand we put food for the journey in a bag. Asma' bint Abi Bakr cut a piecefrom her belt and used it to tie the mouth of the bag, and that is why sheis called, 'She of the two belts.'"<P>She said, "Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andAbu Bakr reached a cave in a mountain called Thawr and remained in it forthree nights. 'Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, who was a young boy who was cleverand quick-witted, would spend the night with them and he would leave thembefore dawn and would be in Makka with Quraysh in the morning as if he hadspent the night there. He did not hear of anything which they were planningabout them but that he would remember it and bring them the news of thatwhen it became dark. 'Amir ibn Fuhayra, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, wouldgraze some milk sheep and bring them to them a hour after nightfall. Theywould spend the night in ease until 'Amir ibn Fuhayra called out when itwas dark. He did that each of the three nights."<P><P><B>XVI. Helmets</B><P>5471. Az-Zuhri reported from Anas that in the year of the Conquest, the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, entered Makka wearing a helmet.<P><P><B>XVII. The <I>burda</I> (mantle), <I>hibra</I> (green Yemeni mantle) and<I>shamla</I> (a robe with which one wraps oneself)</B><P>Khabbab said, "We complained to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, while he was using his mantle as a cushion."<P>5472. Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha related that Anas ibn Malik said,"I was walking with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, who was wearing a Najrani mantle with a thick hem when a desertArab caught up to him and pulled it fiercely so that I saw the side of theneck of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was marked by the hem of the mantle due to the intensity of the tugging.Then he said, 'O Muhammad, order for me some of the property of Allah whichyou have with you!' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, turned to him and laughed, and ordered that he be given a gift."<P>5473. Abu Hazim related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "A woman brought the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,a woven mantle (<I>burda</I>)." Sahlsaid, "Do you know what a <I>burda</I> is?" Someone said, "Yes, a<I>shamla</I> (robe) with a woven border." He said, "She said, 'I wove thiswith my own hands so that you could wear it.' The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, took it as he was in need of it. Hecame out to us using it as a waist-wrapper. A man of the people touched itwith his hand and said, 'Messenger of Allah, let me have it to wear.' 'Yes,'he answered. The man sat there for as long as Allah wished. Then the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, returned having folded it and thensent it to him. The people said to him, 'You have not acted rightly. Youasked him for it knowing that he never refuses someone who asks for something.'The man said, 'By Allah, I have only asked for it only so that it can bemy shroud when I die.'" Sahl said, "It was his shroud."<P>5474. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "A group of 70,000of my community will enter the Garden with their faces shining like the moon."'Ukasha ibn Mihsan al-Asadi stood up, lifting his striped wrapper and said,"Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to make me one of them." He said, "O Allah,make him one of them." Then another man of the Ansar stood up and said,"Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to make me one of them." He said, "'Ukashahas beaten you to it."<P>5475. Qatada said, "I asked Anas, 'What garments did the Prophet, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, most like to wear?' He replied, 'The hibra.'"<P>5476. Qatada reported that Anas ibn Malik said, "The garment which the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, most liked to wear was the hibra."<P>5477. Abu Salama ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf reported that 'A'isha, the wifeof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said that when theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, he waswrapped in hibra mantle.<P><P><B>XVIII. Wraps (<I>kisa'</I>) and black-bordered cloaks(<I>khamisa</I>)</B><P>5478. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba reported that 'A'isha and Ibn 'Abbassaid, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,was dying, he began to cover his face with a cloak (<I>khamisa</I>). Whenhe felt suffocated, he removed it from his face. At that point he said, 'Maythe curse of Allah be upon the Jews and Christians, They took the gravesof their Prophets as places of worship.' He was warning them against whatthey had done."<P>5479. Humayd ibn Hilal related that Abu Burda said, "'A'isha brought outto us a wrap (<I>kisa</I>'), and thick waist-wrapper. She said, 'The soulof the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was taken whilehe was wearing these two.'"<P>5480. 'Urwa reported that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless himand grant him peace, prayed in a cloak (<I>khamisa</I>) with a design. Heglanced at the design, and when he said the salam, he said, 'Take this<I>khamisa</I> to Abu Jahm. It has distracted me from my prayer. Bring methe <I>Anbijaniyya</I> (a plain garment) of Abu Jahm (ibn Hudhayfa ibn Ghanimof the Banu 'Adi ibn Ka'b)."<P><P><B>XIX. Dressing in the fashion called <I>samma'</I></B><P>5481. Hafs ibn 'Asim related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade [the sales called]<I>munabadha</I> and <I>mulamasa</I>, and he forbade praying after Fajr untilthe sun had risen and after 'Asr until the sun had set, and sitting wrappedin a single garment in a way that exposes the private parts to the sky and<I>samma'</I>, which is to leave one shoulder bare."<P>5482. 'Amir ibn Sa'd reported that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade two ways of dressingand two types of sales. He forbade the sales called <I>mulamasa</I> and<I>munabadha</I>."<P>The <I>mulamasa</I> sale occurs when a man touches the garment he wants tobuy with his hand at night or in the day without any further examinationthan that.<P>The <I>munabadha</I> sale is that a man throws his garment to a man whilethe other man throws his to him and that is their transaction, without lookingat the goods or mutual satisfaction.<P>The two forms of dress were the<I> samma'</I>, in which the garment is puton one shoulder leaving the other bare. The other is that someone is wrappedup in a garment while sitting so that there is nothing covering his privateparts.<P><P><B>XX. Wrapping oneself in one garment</B><P>5483. Al-A'raj related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace, forbade two ways of dressing: that aman sit wrapped in a single garment in a way that nothing covers his privateparts, and to be wrapped in a single garment which leaves the other sidebare, and he also forbade the <I>mulamasa</I> and the <I>munabadha</I> sales."<P>5484. 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that theProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade wrapping oneselfin the samma manner and that a man wrap himself up in a single garment withnothing covering his private parts.<P><P><B>XXI. The black khamisa (cloak)</B><P>5485. 'Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As related from Umm Khalid bint Khalid, "TheProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought some clotheswhich includes a small black <I>khamisa</I>. He said, 'To whom do you thinkthat we should give this to wear?' The people were silent. He said, 'Bringme Umm Khalid.' I was carried to him. He took the <I>khamisa</I> with hisown hand and put it on me. He said, 'May it wear out and have to be replaced.'On it were some green or yellow markings. He said, 'Umm Khalid! This is<I>sanah</I>!' <I>Sanah</I> means 'beautiful' in Abyssinian."<P>5486. Muhammad related that Anas said, "When Umm Sulaym gave birth, she saidto me, 'See to this boy and do not give him anything to eat until you havetaken him to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to do<I>tahnik</I> (rub his gums with date).' I took him to him and found himin a garden wearing a Huraythi cloak (<I>khamisa</I>) branding the camelswhich had come to him the conquest (of Makka)."<P><P><B>XXII. Green clothes</B><P>5487. 'Ikrima related that Rifa'a divorced his wife and then 'Abdu'r-Rahmanibn az-Zubayr al-Qurazi married her. 'A'isha said that she [came] wearinga green veil (khimar) and complained to her and showed her some greenness[from bruising] on her skin. The women then used to help one another. Whenthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came, 'A'ishasaid, "I have never seen any woman endure what the believing women endure!Her skin is greener than her clothes!" 'Abdu'r-Rahman heard that she hadgone to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,so he came with two of his sons by another woman. She said, "By Allah, Ihave no wrong action in respect to him, but he is of no more use to me thanthis," and she took hold of the fringe of her garment. 'Abdu'r-Rahman said,"By Allah, she lies, Messenger of Allah! I am completely strong and potentenough, but she is disobedient and wants to go to Rifa'a!" The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If that is thecase, you are not lawful to him (or proper for him, i.e. Rifa'a) until'Abdu'r-Rahman has experienced your sweetness." He saw the two boys withhim and asked, "Are these your sons? "Yes," he answered. He said, "This issomeone about whom you claim what you claim, but, by Allah, they resemblehim as a crow resembles another crow!"<P><P><B>XXIII. White clothes</B><P>5488. It is related that Sa'd said, "In the Battle of Uhud, I saw two menwearing white clothes to the left and right of the Prophet, may Allah blesshim and grant him peace. I had not seen them before and did not see themafterwards."<P>5489. Abu'l-Aswad ad-Dili related that Abu Dharr said, "I went to the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was wearing white clothesand was asleep. Then I came back to him when he had woken up. He said, 'Thereis no one who says, 'There is no god but Allah' and then dies holding tothat, but that he will enter the Garden.' I said, 'Even if he fornicatedand stole?' 'Even if he fornicated and stole,' he answered. I repeated, Isaid, 'Even if he fornicated and stole?' 'Even if he fornicated and stole,'he answered. I said again, ''Even if he fornicated and stole?' He said, 'Evenif he fornicated and stole despite Abu Dharr!'"<P>When Abu Dharr related this, he said, "Despite Abu Dharr!"<P>Abu 'Abdullah said, "This is at the time of death or before it.

'Abdullah retorted that 'Umar saw a striped silk robe being sold andhe said, "Messenger of Allah, if you were to buy this you could wear it onthe day of Jumu'a and to receive delegations when they come to you." He said,"This will only be worn by someone who has no share [of the Next World]."<P>Afterwards the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent a stripedsilk robe which could be worn to 'Umar.

One dayhe dismounted and went into some Arak trees, When he came out, I asked himand he said, ''A'isha and Hafsa.' Then he said, In the Jahiliyya, we didnot give any importance to women. When Islam came and Allah mentioned them,we saw by that they had rights which we owed them without involving themin any of our affairs. There was some words of a dispute between my wifeand I and she was harsh with me. I said to her, "Do you dare do this?" Sheretorted, "You say this to me when your daughter annoys the Prophet, mayAllah bless him and grant him peace?" I went to Hafsa and said to her, "Iwarn you not to disobey Allah and His Messenger." I went first to speak toher and then I went to Umm Salama and said to her, "I warn you not to disobeyAllah and His Messenger." She said, "You are extraordinary, son of al-Khattab!You interfere in our affairs even to the point where you come between theMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his wives!"So she rejected that.<P>"'There was a man of the Ansar and when he was absent from the Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I was present, I toldhim what had happened, and when I was absent from the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was present, he conveyedto me what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,had said or done. At that time all of those around the Messenger of Allah,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had submitted to him with the soleexception of the king of Ghassan in Syria and we feared that he might attackus. I was suddenly aware of the Ansari saying, "Something has happened!"I said to him, "What is it? Has the Ghassani come?" "It is far worse thanthat," he answered. "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and granthim peace, has divorced his wives." I went and found them all weeping intheir rooms. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,had climbed up into an upper room of his. There was a servant at the doorof the room. I went to him and said, "Ask for permission for me to enter."I was given permission and went in. The Prophet, may Allah bless him andgrant him peace, was on a mat which marked his side. Under his head was aleather pillow stuffed with palm fibre. There were some skins hanging upand some mimosa leaves. I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Umm Salamaand what Umm Salama had replied to me, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allahbless him and grant him peace, laughed. He remained there for 29 days beforehe came down.'"<P>5506. From az-Zuhri: Hind bint al-Harith reported that Umm Salama said, "Onenight the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, woke up and said,'Glory be to Allah!

Iwas brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, andhe clothed me in it with his own hand. He said, 'May it wear out and haveto be replaced' twice. He began to look at the design on the cloak and pointedat me with his hand and said, 'Umm Khalid! This is sana!'
