<P>
<B>I. The obligation of <I>zakat</I></B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty,<I> "Establish the prayer and pay the zakat."
</I>(2:43)
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "Abu Sufyan related to me mentioning the hadith of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'He instructed us to pray,
pay <I>zakat</I>, maintain ties of kinship and to be chaste.'"
<P>
1331. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, sent Mu'adh to Yemen and said, 'Call on them to testify
that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. If they
comply with that, then let them know that Allah has made the five prayers
obligatory on them every day and night. If they comply with that, then let
them know that Allah has made the payment of <I>zakat</I> from their property
obligatory on them, to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to
the poor.'"
<P>
1332. It is related from Abu Ayyub that a man said to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, 'Tell me an action which will ensure my entrance
into the Garden. Someone said, 'What does he want? What is wrong with him?'
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'What he wants
is to know something. Worship Allah and do not associate anything else with
him. Establish the prayer and pay the <I>zakat</I> and maintain ties of
kinship.'"
<P>
This is related from Abu Ayyub. Abu 'Abdullah said, "I fear that Muhammad
is unprotected. It is 'Amr."
<P>
1333. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "A bedouin came to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Tell me an action by which,
if I do it, I will enter the Garden.' He said, 'Worship Allah and do not
associate anything else with him. Perform the prescribed prayer and pay the
obligatory zakat, and fast Ramadan.' He said, 'By the One who has my soul
in His hand, I will do no more than this.' When he turned to go, the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Anyone who wants to see one
of the people of the Garden should look at this man.'"
<P>
This is related from Abu Zur'a from the Prophet.
<P>
1334. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays
came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,
'Messenger of Allah, this is the tribe of Rabi'a. We can only come to you
in the sacred month since the unbelievers of Mudar are between us and you.
Give us some clear instructions which we can take from you and invite those
we left behind.' He said, 'I instruct you to do four things and forbid them
to do four things.' He commanded them to believe in Allah and to testify
that there is no god but Allah (and he made a fist of his hand like that),
to establish the prayers, to pay the zakat, and to pay the <I>khums</I> (fifth)
from booty you take.' I forbide you four things:<I> dubba', hantam</I>,
<I>naqir</I> and <I>muzaffat</I>. [different kinds of wine vessels] '" Hammad
said, "Belief in Allah is to testify that there is no god but Allah."
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z31">1335</A>. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "When
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died and
Abu Bakr became the khalif, some of the Arabs rejected Islam. 'Umar said,
'How can you fight these people when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "I am commanded to fight people until they
say: 'There is no god but Allah.' Whoever says that, his property and life
are safe from me, except if there is a legal right, and his reckoning is
up to Allah."' He said, 'I will fight anyone who makes any distinction between
the prayer and <I>zakat</I>. <I>Zakat</I> is what is due from property. By
Allah, if they refuse me as much as a she-goat which they used to pay to
the Messenger of Allah, I will fight them for it.' 'Umar said, 'By Allah,
the fact was that Allah had given Abu Bakr true insight and I recognised
that he was right.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>II: Allegiance accepted on the basis of payment of zakat.</B>
<P>
<I>"If they repent, and establish the prayer and pay the zakat, they are
your brothers in religion." </I>(9:5)
<P>
1336. It is related that Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I gave allegiance to
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the basis of performing
the prayer, paying the <I>zakat</I> and giving good counsel to every Muslim."
<P>
<P>
<B>III: The wrong action of someone who refuses to pay <I>zakat</I></B>
<P>
The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"As for those who hoard up gold and silver
and do not spend it in the way of Allah, give them the news of a painful
punishment, on the Day it is heated up in the fire of Hell and their foreheads,
sides and backs are branded with it: 'This is what you hoarded for yourselves!
So taste what you were hoarding!'"</I> (9:34-35)
<P>
1337. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Camels will come to their master in their
prime and if he did not pay what was due on them, they will trample him with
their hooves. Sheep will come to their master in their prime and if he did
not pay what was due on them, they will trample him with their hooves and
gore him with their horns. One of their rights is that they should be milked
with water in front of them. May none of you come on the Day of Rising with
a bleating sheep round his neck saying, 'O Muhammad!' For I will say, 'I
can do nothing for you now. I conveyed the message. And may none of you come
with a complaining camel round his neck saying, 'O Muhammad!' For I will
say, 'I can do nothing for you now. I conveyed the message.'"
<P>
1338. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone is given wealth by
Allah and does not pay the <I>zakat</I> due on it, then on the Day of Rising
it will appear to him in the form of a smooth-headed male viper with two
black spots over its eyes. It will coil around his neck and strike at his
cheeks saying, 'I am your wealth. I am your treasure."' Then he recited,
<I>'Those who are tight-fisted with the bounty Allah has given them should
not suppose...'</I>" (3:180)
<P>
<P>
<B>IV: That on which <I>zakat</I> is paid is not considered treasure </B>
<P>
according to the words of the Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"Zakat is not due on anything less than five uqiyas."
<P>
1339. Khalid ibn Aslam said, "We once went out with 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar and
a bedouin asked, 'Tell me about the words of Allah, <I>"Those who hoard up
gold and silver, and do not spend it in the way of Allah."</I> (9:34)' Ibn
'Umar said, 'Woe to all who hoard them up and do not pay the zakat due on
them. This was before the obligation of <I>zakat</I> was revealed. Then when
it was revealed, Allah made it something which purifies wealth.'"
<P>
1340. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "No <I>zakat</I> is due on anything
less than five <I>uqiyas</I>. No zakat is due on less than five camels. No
<I>zakat</I> is due on less than five <I>wasqs</I>."
<P>
1341. It is related that Zayd ibn Wahb said, "I passed by ar-Rabadha and
came upon Abu Dharr there. I said to him, 'What has brought you here?' He
said, 'I was in Syria and Mu'awiya and I disagreed about the
<I>ayat</I>,<I> "Those who hoard up gold and silver, and do not spend it
in the way of Allah." </I>Mu'awiya said, "It was sent down about the People
of the Book." I said, "It was sent down about us and them." We argued about
that and and he wrote to 'Uthman to complain about me. 'Uthman wrote to me
asking me to come to Madina so I went. A lot of people gathered round me
as if they had never seen me before. I mentioned that to 'Uthman and he said
to me, "If you wish, you can retire and live near here." That is why I am
here in this place and even if an Abyssinian had commanded me, I would have
heard and obeyed.'"
<P>
[ar-Rabadha is three stages from Madina.]
<P>
1342. It is related that al-Ahnaf ibn Qays said, "I was sitting with a group
of Quraysh when a man with coarse hair, clothes and appearance came and stood
over them, gave the greeting, and then said, 'Give good news to those who
hoard up wealth of a stone which will be heated in Hellfire and then placed
on their chests till it comes out through their shoulder blades and is then
placed on their shoulder blades till it comes out through their chests, going
backwards and forwards,' Then he turned and sat down by a column. I followed
him and sat beside him, not knowing who he was. I said to him, 'I think the
people disliked what you said.' He said, 'They do not understand anything
that my friend has told me.' I asked, 'Who is your friend?' He said, 'The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "O Abu Dharr! Can
you see Uhud?" So I looked at the sun to see how much of the day was left
thinking that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was going to send me to do something for him. I said, "Yes." He said, "I
would not like to have the weight of Uhud in gold. I would give away all
of it except for three dinars." Those people do not understand and amass
the goods of this world. No, by Allah, I will not ask them for anything of
this world nor will I seek any advice from them regarding the <I>deen</I>
until I meet Allah the Mighty, the Glorious.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>V: Spending wealth in the way it should be spent</B>
<P>
1343. It is related that Ibn Mas'ud said, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, 'There can be no envy except in respect
of two people: a man to whom Allah gives wealth and also the ability to spend
it in the way it should be spent, and a man to whom Allah gives wisdom and
who then makes decisions according to it and teaches it other people.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>VI: Ostentation in giving sadaqa </B>
<P>
With respect to His words, <I>"You who believe! Do not nullify your sadaqa
by demands for gratitude or insulting words" </I>to <I>"Allah does not guide
the people of the unbelievers."</I> (2:264) Ibn 'Abbas said, "'<I>Saldan</I>'
refers to something that has nothing on it." 'Ikrima said, "<I>Wabil</I>
means heavy rain and tall means dew."
<P>
<P>
<B>VII: Allah does not accept sadaqa from dishonestly acquired property,
only accepting it from honest earnings </B>
<P>
According to His words<I>, "Those who believe and do right actions and establish
the prayer and pay zakat, will have their reward with their Lord. They will
feel no fear and know no sorrow." </I>(2:276-277)
<P>
1344. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever gives in <I>sadaqa</I>
as much as a date from honest earnings - and Allah only accepts what is good
- Allah will accept it in His right hand and will then increase it in size
for the giver, just like one of you might rear a foal, until it is the size
of a mountain."
<P>
It is corroborated from Ibn Dinar.
<P>
Two different <I>isnads</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>VIII: Giving <I>sadaqa</I> before it is rejected</B>
<P>
1345. It is related that Haritha ibn Wahb was heard to say, "I heard the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Give <I>sadaqa</I>.
For a time will come when a man will go about with his <I>sadaqa</I> and
not find anyone to accept it. People will say, 'If you had brought it yesterday,
I would have accepted it. Today I have no need of it.'"
<P>
1346 It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The Hour will not come until there is so much
wealth circulating among you that someone with wealth will be concerned about
who will accept his <I>sadaqa</I> and until, when he offers it, the person
to whom he offers it says, 'I do not need it.'"
<P>
1347. It is related that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I was with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when two men came to him.
One of them complained of poverty and the other complained about highway
robbery. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "As for highway robbery, soon there will come to you a time when a
caravan will be able to set out for Makka without a guard. As for poverty,
the Hour will not come until one of you goes about with his <I>sadaqa</I>
unable to find anyone to accept it from him. Then he will stand before Allah
and there will no veil, nor any interpreter to interpret for him, between
him and Allah and He will say to him, "Did I not give you wealth?" He will
say, "Yes." Then Allah will say, "Did I not send a Messenger to you?" and
he will say, "Yes." Then he will look to his right and see nothing but the
Fire and then to his left and see nothing but the Fire. Each of you should
protect himself from the Fire, even if only with half a date, or, if he cannot
manage even that, then with a good word.'"
<P>
1348. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "A time will come upon people when a man will go about
with his <I>sadaqa</I> of gold and not find anyone to take it from him. A
man will be seen being followed by forty women who seek his protection because
of the lack of men and great superfluity of women."
<P>
<P>
<B>IX: "Protect yourselves from the Fire, even with half a date" or a small
amount of sadaqa</B>
<P>
<I>"The likeness of those who expend their wealth, seeking Allah's good pleasure,
and to confirm themselves .</I>..(to)...<I>all manner of fruit."</I> (2:265-266)
<P>
1349. It is related that Ibn Mas'ud said, "When the ayat of sadaqa was revealed,
we were working as porters. A man came and gave a lot of <I>sadaqa</I> and
they said, 'A show-off.' Another man came and gave only a<I> sa' </I>in
<I>sadaqa</I> and they said, 'Allah does not need this <I>sa'</I>.' Then
it was revealed:<I> 'As for the people who find fault with the believers
who spontaneously give sadaqa , and with those who can find nothing to give
but their own effort, and deride them.' </I>(9:79)"
<P>
1350. It is related that Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari said, "When the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to instruct us to give
<I>sadaqa</I>, we would go to the market and get work as porters to earn
a mudd. Today some of us have a hundred thousand."
<P>
1351. It is related that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Protect yourselves from the
Fire, even if with only half a date.'"
<P>
1352. It is related that 'A'isha said, "A woman came with her two daughters
to beg and I had nothing but a date which I gave to her. She divided it between
her two daughters, not eating any of it herself. Then she got up and left.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came in to us and I
told him about this and he said, 'Anyone who is put to the test by these
daughters in anything,they will be shield him from the Fire.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>X: What is the best kind of <I>sadaqa</I>? <I>Sadaqa</I> given by a
tight-fisted healthy person</B>
<P>
According to Allah's words,<I> "Spend of what We have provided you before
that death comes upon one of you..." </I>(63:10) and <I>"You who believe!
Give away some of what We have provided for you before a Day arrives on which
there is no trading.." </I>(2:254)
<P>
1353. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "A man came to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, which
<I>sadaqa</I> has the greatest reward?' He said, 'That you give <I>sadaqa</I>
while you are healthy yet tight-fisted, in fear of poverty and desiring wealth.
Do not put it off until death is near and you say, "So-and-so should have
this much and so-and-so this much,"' when it already belongs to someone else."
<P>
1354. It is related from 'A'isha, "The wives of the Prophet said to the
Prophet,may Allah bless him and grant him peace, 'Which of us will be the
first to join you?' He said, 'The one with the longest hand.' They began
to measure their hands and Sawda had the longest hand. Later we understood
that the one with the longest hand referred to giving <I>sadaqa</I>. She
(Zaynab) was the first of us to meet him and she used to love to give
<I>sadaqa</I>.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XI: Giving <I>sadaqa</I> openly with regard to Allah's words, <I>"Those
who expend their wealth night and day, secretly and in
public"</I>..to..<I>"neither shall they sorrow."</I> (2:274)</B>
<P>
<P>
<B>XII: Giving <I>sadaqa</I> in secret</B>
<P>
Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "A man who gives <I>sadaqa</I>, concealing it so that his left hand
does not know what his right hand does..." Allah Almighty says, <I>"If you
conceal it, and give to the poor, that is better for you."</I> (2:271)
<P>
<P>
<B>XIII: When someone unknowingly gives sadaqa to a rich person </B>
<P>
1355. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "A man said, 'I must give some
<I>sadaqa</I>,' and went out with his <I>sadaqa</I>, putting it in the hand
of a thief. The next day people said he had given <I>sadaqa</I> to a thief.
He said, 'O Allah, praise is Yours. I will again give <I>sadaqa</I>.' He
went out with his <I>sadaqa</I> and this time put it in the hand of an
adulteress. The next day people said that he had given <I>sadaqa</I> in the
night to an adulteress. He said, 'O Allah, praise is Yours. I gave it to
an adulteress. I will give more <I>sadaqa</I>.' He went out with his sadaqa
and put it in the hand of a rich man. The next day people said he had given
<I>sadaqa</I> to a rich man. He said, 'O Allah, praise is Yours. I have given
<I>sadaqa</I> to a thief, an adulteress, and a rich man.' Then someone came
and said to him, 'Your <I>sadaqa</I> to a thief might make him abstain from
stealing. What you gave to the adulteress might make her abstain from her
fornication. And what you gave to the rich man might make him reflect so
that he will spend out from what Allah has given him.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XIV: When someone, without realising it, gives <I>sadaqa</I> to his son
</B>
<P>
1356. It is related that Ma'n ibn Yazid said, "I, my father and grandfather
gave our allegiance to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and he arranged and concluded my marriage. I once went to him
with a complaint. My father Yazid had put aside some dinars to give as
<I>sadaqa</I> and placed them in the care of a man in the mosque and then
I came and took them and brought them to him. He said, 'By Allah, I did not
mean you!' I took the case to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and he said, 'Yazid, for you what you intended, and
for you, Ma'n, what you took.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XV: Giving <I>sadaqa</I> with the right hand</B>
<P>
1357. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There are seven whom Allah will shade with His
shade on the day when there is no shade but His shade: a just Imam, a youth
who grows up worshipping Allah, a man whose heart is attached to the mosque,
two men who love each other for the sake of Allah alone, meeting for that
reason and parting for that reason, a man who refuses the advances of a noble
and beautiful woman, saying, 'I fear Allah', a man who gives sadaqa and conceals
it so that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives, and a man
who remembers Allah when he is alone and his eyes overflow with tears."
<P>
1358. It is related that Haritha ibn Wahb was heard to say, "I heard the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Give <I>sadaqa</I>.
For a time will come when a man will go about with his <I>sadaqa</I> and
not find anyone to accept it. People will say, 'If you had brought it yesterday,
I would have accepted it. Today I have no need of it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XVI: Someone commanding his servant to give sadaqa and not distributing
it himself</B>
<P>
Abu Musa said from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
"He is one of those who give <I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
1359. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When a woman gives some of the food
in her house which is not spoiled, she gets a reward for what she gives out,
her husband for what he earned and the custodian the same. The reward of
one in no way diminishes that of the others."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVII: <I>Sadaqa</I> should only be given by the wealthy</B>
<P>
Anyone who gives <I>sadaqa</I> when he or his family are in need or when
he is in debt should know that debts take precedence over <I>sadaqa</I>,
setting free slaves and giving presents. Such <I>sadaqa</I> should be returned
to him. He has no right to ruin other people's property. The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who take's people's property
intending to ruin it will be ruined by Allah," unless he is known for his
fortitude and prefers others to himself, even when in extreme need, as Abu
Bakr did when he gave all his wealth as <I>sadaqa</I> and as the Ansar gave
preference to the Muhajirun. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, forbade wastage of wealth so a person has no right to ruin the property
of other people by giving <I>sadaqa</I>.
<P>
Ka'b mentioned: "I said, 'Messenger of Allah, as part of my repentance I
want to give away all my property as <I>sadaqa</I> for Allah and His Messenger.'
He said, 'It would be better for you to keep some of your property.' I replied,
'In that case I will keep my share from Khaybar.'"
<P>
1360. It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, that he said, "The best <I>sadaqa</I> is that given
by the wealthy. Begin with your dependents."
<P>
1361. It is related from Hakim ibn Hizam that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The upper hand is better than the lower hand.
Begin with your dependents. The best <I>sadaqa</I> is that given by the wealthy.
Anyone who refrains [from asking], Allah will spare him the need to and anyone
who seeks to be independent, Allah will give him independence."
<P>
Another isnad from Abu Hurayra.
<P>
1362. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said while he was on the minbar and talking
about <I>sadaqa</I> and refraining from asking and begging, "The upper hand
is better than the lower hand. The upper hand is the one which spends and
the lower is the beggar's."
<P>
<P>
<B>XVIII: Someone who makes others feel indebted to him by what he gives</B>
<P>
with reference to the words of Allah, <I>"Those who spend their wealth in
the way of Allah and then do follow up what they have spent..." </I>(2:262)
<P>
<P>
<B>XIX: Someone wanting to give <I>sadaqa</I> the same day [he gets it]</B>
<P>
1363. It is related that 'Uqba ibn al-Harith said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, led us in<I> 'Asr </I>prayer. He got up hurriedly
and entered the room. He came out immediately and I asked (or he was asked)
about that. He said, 'I left a piece of gold of <I>sadaqa</I> in the room
and I did not want it to be with me in the night so I distributed it.' "
<P>
<P>
<B>XX: Encouraging people to give <I>sadaqa</I> and interceding for others
to get it</B>
<P>
1364. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went out on the Day of <I>'Id </I>and prayed two
<I>rak'ats</I> and did not pray before or after it. Then he went to the women
with Bilal and warned them and commanded them to give <I>sadaqa</I>. So a
woman began to give her ear-rings and rings."
<P>
1365. It is related that the father of Abu Burda ibn Abi Musa said, "When
a beggar came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, or something was requested from him, he said, 'Intercede on behalf
of others and you will get the reward. Allah achieves what He will on the
tongue of His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
1366. It is related that Asma' said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to me, 'Do not withhold or it will be withheld from
you.'"
<P>
It is related from 'Abda, "And he said, 'Do not count up what you have or
Allah will count up what you owe Him!'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXI: Giving as much <I>sadaqa</I> as possible </B>
<P>
1367. It is related from Asma' bint Abi Bakr that she went to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, "Do not be retentive
or Allah will be retentive in respect of you. Spend as much as you can."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXII: <I>Sadaqa</I> wipes out wrong action</B>
<P>
1368.It is related that Hudhayfa said, "'Umar said, 'Who among you remembers
the <I>hadith</I> of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, about the trials (<I>fitna</I>)?'" He said, "I said, 'I remember
it as he said it.' He said, 'You are bold enough for it. How was it?'" He
said, "I said, 'A man's trial regarding his wife, children and neighbours
is wiped out by the prayer, sadaqa and doing what is right.' (Sulayman said
that he used to say, 'prayer, <I>sadaqa</I> and commanding the right and
forbidding the wrong.') 'Umar said, 'That is not what I meant. Rather I meant
that which will spread like the waves of the sea.'" He said, "I said, 'You
need not worry about it, Amir al-Mu'minin. There is a locked door between
you and it.' He said, 'Will the door be broken down or opened?'" He said,
"I said, 'No, it will be broken.' He said, 'When it is broken, it will never
be closed again?'" He said, "I said, 'Yes.'" Abu Wa'il said, "We were afraid
to ask him about the door and we said to Masruq, 'Ask him.'" He said, "He
said, 'I asked him and he said, "'Umar."'" He said, "We said, 'Did 'Umar
know who was meant?' He said, ''Yes, as there will be night before tomorrow.'"
That is a <I>hadith</I> which he related to me without errors.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIII: Someone giving <I>sadaqa</I> while still an idolater and then becoming
Muslim</B>
<P>
1369. It is related that Hakim ibn Hizam said, "I said, 'Messenger of Allah,
what do you say about the things such as <I>sadaqa</I>, freeing slaves and
maintaining kinship which I used to do to purify myself in the time of Jahiliyya?
Will there be any reward for them?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, replied, 'You became Muslim with all the good you did in
the past.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIV: The reward of a servant when he gives <I>sadaqa</I> on the orders
of his master which is not spoiled</B>
<P>
1370. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When a woman gives some of her husband's
food in her house which is not spoiled, she gets a reward for what she gives
out, her husband for what he earned and the custodian the same."
<P>
1371. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "The trustworthy Muslim custodian who carries out
(and he may have said, "gives") what he is ordered to do fully, generously
and cheerfully, and pays it to the person to whom he was ordered to pay it,
is one of those who give <I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXV: The reward of a woman when she gives <I>sadaqa</I> or feeds people
from her husband's house without spoiling it</B>
<P>
1372. It is related from 'A'isha from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, that he was referring to a woman giving <I>sadaqa</I> from
her husband's house.
<P>
It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "When a woman gives someone something to eat from the house
of her husband which is not spoiled, she gets her reward and he gets the
same and the custodian has the same again. Her husband gets it for what he
earned and she for what she spent."
<P>
1373. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "When a woman spends something some food from her
house which is not spoiled, she gets her reward and the husband gets what
he earned and the custodian has the same again."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVI: The words of Allah Almighty<I>, "As for him who gives out and is
godfearing and confirms the Good, We will pave his way to Ease. But as for
him who is stingy and self-satisfied, and denies the Good, We will pave his
way to Difficulty." </I>(92:5-10) "O Allah, refund the one who gives
money."</B>
<P>
1374. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "There is no day which dawns on the slaves
Of Allah without two angels descending and one of them saying, 'O Allah,
refund those who give money' and the other saying, 'O Allah, ruin those who
withhold it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVII: The likeness of someone who gives <I>sadaqa</I> and a miser</B>
<P>
1375. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The likeness of the miser and someone who
gives <I>sadaqa</I> is like two men wearing shirts of chain-mail."
<P>
It is related that Abu Hurayra heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, "The likeness of the miser and the one who
gives is like two men wearing shirts of chain-mail from their breasts to
their collar bones. When the giver of <I>sadaqa</I> spends, his shirt expands
over his body until it covers his fingertips and obliterates his footsteps.
When the miser wants to spend anything, every link remains in its place.
He tries to make it looser but it will not get looser."
<P>
Tawus corroborates "the two shirts of chain-mail."
<P>
Tawus said, "two shirts of chain-mail".
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra, "I heard Abu Hurayra the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, "Two shirts of chain-mail."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXVIII: <I>Sadaqa</I> from earnings and trade </B>
<P>
with reference to the words of Allah Almighty<I>, "O you who believe, spend
of the good things you have earned..</I>.(to)..<I>."Allah is Rich Beyond
Need, Praiseworthy." </I>(2:267)
<P>
<P>
<B>XXIX: Every Muslim should give <I>sadaqa</I>. Anyone who has nothing to
give should do what is right</B>
<P>
1376. It is related from the grandfather of Abu Burda that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Every Muslim should give
<I>sadaqa</I>." They said, "O Prophet of Allah, what about if someone has
nothing to give?" He said, "He should get work and earn something and give
<I>sadaqa</I>." They said, "And if he cannot get any?" He said, "He should
help someone troubled by a need." They said, "If he cannot not find anyone?"
He said, "He should do what is right and refrain from evil. That is
<I>sadaqa</I> for him."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXX: How much should be given in <I>zakat</I> and <I>sadaqa</I>. Someone
who gives a sheep</B>
<P>
1377. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said, "A sheep was sent to Nusayba
al-Ansariyya and she sent some of it to 'A'isha. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, asked, 'Have you got anything?' I said, 'No, except
what Nusayba sent from that sheep.' He said, 'Bring it. It has reached its
place.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXI: The <I>zakat</I> on silver</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z1">1378</A>. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "No
<I>zakat</I> is due on anything less than five <I>uqiyas</I>. No <I>zakat</I>
is due on less than five camels. No <I>zakat</I> is due on less than five
<I>wasqs</I>.".
<P>
1379. This is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri from the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXII: Paying zakat in other goods. </B>
<P>
Tawus said that Mu'adh said to the people of Yemen, "Bring me small or
second-hand garments for zakat instead of barley and millet. It will be easy
for you and good for the Companions of the Prophet in Madina."
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Khalid has kept
his chain-mail and weapons for fighting the way of Allah." The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Give <I>sadaqa</I>, even from
your jewelry.' He did not distinguish the obligatory <I>zakat</I> from other
<I>sadaqa</I>. A woman would begin to give her ear-rings and necklace. He
did not make "goods" specific to gold and silver.
<P>
1380. It is related from Anas that Abu Bakr wrote to him concerning what
Allah had instucted his Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
to do in the case of someone whose sadaqa payment should have been a one
year old she-camel, which he did not have, while he did have a two year old
she-camel. It should be accepted from him and the <I>zakat</I>-collector
would give him twenty dirhams or two sheep in compensation. If he had no
one year old she-camel but did have a two year old male camel, it should
be accepted from him and he would not receive anything in compensation."
<P>
1381. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "I am a witness to the fact that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did the prayer
before giving the <I>khutba</I>. He thought that the women could not hear,
so he went to them with Bilal, who was holding out his garment, and admonished
them and commanded them to give <I>sadaqa</I>. A woman began to give." (Ayyub
indicated his ears and neck.)
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIII: The wealth of individuals should not be combined nor shared wealth
split up, </B>
<P>
as is mentioned from Salim from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace.
<P>
1382. It is related from Anas that Abu Bakr wrote to him about what had been
made obligatory by the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace: that the wealth of individuals should not be combined, nor shared
wealth split up, merely because of the fear of having to pay (more)
<I>zakat</I>.
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIV: If there are two equal partners, they pay in equal parts between
them</B>
<P>
Tawus and 'Ata' said, "If the two partners know their individual shares,
their property is not combined." Sufyan said, "It does not become obligatory
until each of them has forty sheep."
<P>
1383. It is related from Anas that Abu Bakr wrote to him about what the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had made obligatory, "If
there are two equal partners, they pay in equal parts between them."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXV: The zakat of camels</B>
<P>
Abu Bakr, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayra mentioned it from the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace/
<P>
1384. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, "A bedouin asked the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about <I>hijra</I> and
he said, 'Woe to you! It is a hard business. Do you have any camels on which
you pay <I>zakat</I>?" He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Even though you work beyond
the seas, Allah will not neglect any action you do.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVI: Someone whose <I>zakat</I> is a two year old she-camel which he
does not have</B>
<P>
1385. It is related from Anas that Abu Bakr wrote to them about the obligatory
<I>zakat</I> which Allah commanded His Messenger, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, to collect: "Anyone whose <I>zakat</I> is a four year old
she-camel and who does not have one but does have a three year old she-camel,
the three year old is accepted from him and he adds two sheep to it, if they
are easily available to him, or alternatively twenty dirhams. Anyone whose
<I>zakat</I> is a three year old she-camel and who does not have one, but
does have a four year old she-camel, the four year old is accepted from him
and the <I>zakat</I>-collector gives him twenty dirhams or two sheep. Anyone
whose <I>zakat</I> is a three year old she-camel and who only has a two year
old she-camel, the two year old is accepted from him and he adds two sheep
or twenty dirhams. Anyone whose <I>zakat</I> is a two year old she-camel
who has a three year old she-camel, it is accepted from him and the
<I>zakat</I>-collector gives him twenty dirhams or two sheep. Anyone whose
<I>zakat</I> is a two year old she-camel and who does not have one, but who
does have a one year old she-camel, the one year old is accepted from him
and he adds twenty dirhams or two sheep."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVII: The zakat of sheep</B>
<P>
1386. It is related from Anas that Abu Bakr wrote him this letter when he
sent him to Bahrayn: "In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate.
This concerns the obligation of <I>zakat</I> which the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made obligatory for the Muslims
and to which Allah commanded His Messenger. Any Muslim who is asked to pay
the correct amount should pay it and anyone who is asked is asked for more
than that should not pay it. For twenty-four camels or less it is paid in
sheep, one sheep for every five camels. From twenty-five to thirty-five,
it is a one year old she-camel. From thirty-six to forty-five, it is a two
year old she-camel. From forty-six to sixty, it is a three-year old female
fit for breeding. From sixty-one to seventy-five, it is a four year old
she-camel. From seventy-six to ninety, it is two two year old she-camels.
From ninety-one to one hundred and twenty, it is two three year old she-camels
fit for breeding. If there are more than one hundred and twenty, it is a
two-year old female for every forty and a three-year old for every fifty.
If someone has only four camels, he does not have to pay any <I>zakat</I>
unless he wishes to. When the camels reach five in number a sheep is owed
for them.
<P>
"As for the <I>zakat</I> of grazing sheep, from forty to one hundred it is
one sheep. If there are between one hundred and twenty and two hundred, it
is two sheep. If there are between two hundred and three hundred it is three.
If there are more than three hundred, it is one sheep for every hundred.
If the man's flock is less than forty sheep, there is no <I>zakat</I> on
them unless their owner wishes.
<P>
"For silver it is one-fortieth. If the amount is only one hundred and ninety
dirhams, nothing is owed unless its owner wishes."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXVIII: Neither old animals, ones with defects nor rams should be taken
as <I>zakat</I> unless the <I>zakat</I>-collector wishes to do so</B>
<P>
1387. It is related from Anas that Abu Bakr wrote to him what Allah had commanded
His Messenger , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Neither an old
animal, one with a defect nor a ram is taken as <I>zakat</I> unless the
<I>zakat</I>-collector wishes to do so."
<P>
<P>
<B>XXXIX: Taking a young she-goat as <I>zakat</I></B>
<P>
1388. It is related from Abu Hurayra that Abu Bakr said, "If Allah, if they
refuse a she-goat which they used to pay to the Messenger of Allah, I will
fight them for it.' 'Umar said, 'By Allah, the fact was that Allah had given
Abu Bakr true insight and I recognised that he was right.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XL: Not taking <I>zakat</I> from people's most prized property </B>
<P>
1389. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sent Mu'adh to Yemen and said, "You are going
to a people who have a Book. The first thing you call them to should be the
worship of Allah. When they acknowledge Allah, then tell them that Allah
has made the five prayers obligatory for them in a twenty-four day. When
they do the prayer, inform them that Allah has made it obligatory for
<I>zakat</I> to be taken from their property and given to their poor. If
they obey you in that, take it from them but avoid people's most prized
property."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLI: There is no <I>zakat</I> on less than five camels</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z2">1390</A>. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
"No <I>zakat</I> is due on anything less than five <I>wasqs</I> of dates.
No <I>zakat</I> is due on less than five <I>uqiyas</I> of silver. No
<I>zakat</I> is due on less than five camels."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLII: The <I>zakat</I> of cattle</B>
<P>
Abu Humayd said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "I would not wish to see a man coming before Allah with a mooing cow."
It is said that <I>khuwwar</I> means lowing with their voices raised as cows
low.
<P>
1391. It is related that Abu Dharr said, "I went to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and he said, 'By the One in whose hand my
self is (or "By the One, there is no god but Him" or as he swore), every
man who has camels, cattle or sheep whose due is not paid will be presented
with them on the Day of Rising larger and fatter than they were and they
will trample him with their hooves and gore him with their horns. Every time
the last one leaves him the first comes back again, until all the judgements
between people are decided."
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIII: Paying zakat to relative</B>
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "He will have
two rewards: that of kinship and that of <I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
1392. It is related from Ishaq ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha that he heard
Anas ibn Malik say, "Abu Talha had more property in palm trees than any of
the Ansar in Madina. His favourite property was Bayruha' which was opposite
the mosque. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to enter it and drink its sweet water." Anas said, "When this
<I>ayat</I> was sent down: <I>'You will not attain true goodness until you
give of what you love,'</I> (3:92) Abu Talha went to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, Allah,
may He be blessed and exalted! says, "<I>You will not attain true goodness
until you give of what you love</I>." The property I love the best is Bayruha'.
It is <I>sadaqa</I> for Allah whose goodness I hope for and I hope that it
will be stored up for me with Allah. Messenger of Allah, dispose of it in
whatever way Allah shows you is best.' The Messenger of Allah , may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Excellent! That is a profitable property.
That is is a profitable property. I have heard what you have said and I think
that you should give it to your relatives.' Abu Talha said, 'I will do that,
Messenger of Allah!' So Abu Talha divided it among his relatives and cousins."
<P>
Rawh corroborated it. Malik said "<I>ra'ih</I>" (rather than <I>rabih</I>)
<P>
1393. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, set out to the place of prayer on
the day of <I>Ad-ha</I> or <I>Fitr</I> and admonished the people and commanded
them to give alms, saying, 'O people! Give alms!' Then he passed by the women.
He said, 'O congregation of women! Give alms for I have seen that you will
make up the majority of the inhabitants of the Fire!' They said, 'Why, Messenger
of Allah?' He said, 'You call down too many curses and show ingratitude to
your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intellect or
<I>deen</I>. Yet the mind of even a resolute man might be swept away by one
of you. O company of women!' Then he left. When he reached his house, Zaynab,
the wife of Ibn Mas'ud, came and asked permission to enter. It was said,
'Messenger of Allah, Zaynab is here.' He said, 'Which Zaynab?' He was told,
'The wife of Ibn Mas'ud.' He said, 'Yes, let her enter.' She said, 'Prophet
of Allah. Today you instructed us to give <I>sadaqa</I> and I have some jewellery
which I wanted to give as <I>sadaqa</I> but Ibn Mas'ud claimed that he and
his children have more right to be given it as <I>sadaqa</I>.' The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, Ibn Mas'ud spoke the truth.
Your husband and children are more entitled for it to be given as
<I>sadaqa</I> to them.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIV: A Muslim not having to pay <I>zakat</I> on his horses</B>
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z38">1394</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A Muslim does not
have to pay <I>zakat</I> on his horse or slave."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLV: A Muslim does not have to pay <I>zakat</I> on his slaves</B>
<P>
1395. It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace.
<P>
It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "A Muslim does not have to pay <I>zakat</I> on his
horse or slave."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLVI: Giving <I>sadaqa</I> to orphans</B>
<P>
1396. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, "One day the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sat on the minbar and we sat around him. He
said, 'Part of what I fear for you after I have gone is the beauty and attraction
of this world which will be opened up to you.' A man said, 'Messenger of
Allah, can evil come from good?' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was silent. Then (the man) was told, 'What is wrong with you!
You speak to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he
is not speaking to you!' Then we saw that something was being revealed to
him." He continued, "He wiped the sweat off and said, 'Where is the man who
asked,' and it seemed as if he was praising him. He said, 'Evil does not
come from good. New Spring verdure can cause illness or even death if the
animals that eat the greenery do not, after eating their fill, then face
towards the sun and defecate and urinate and then graze again. This wealth
is verdant and sweet. Blessed is that wealth from which a Muslim gives to
the poor, the orphan and the traveller.' Or as the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said. 'Anyone who takes it without having any right
to it is like someone who eats and is not satisfied. It will be a witness
against him on the Day of Rising."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLVII: Giving <I>zakat</I> to a spouse and orphans in one's care</B>
<P>
Abu Sa'id reported that from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace.
<P>
1397. It is related that Zaynab, the wife of 'Abdullah, said, "I was in the
mosque and heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say,
'Give <I>sadaqa</I>, even from your jewellery.'" Zaynab used to maintain
'Abdullah and some orphans in her care. 'Amr said, "She said to 'Abdullah,
'Ask the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whether
it will be enough <I>sadaqa</I> for me to maintain you and the orphans in
my care.' He said, 'You ask the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace.' She said, 'So I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and found one of the women of the Ansar at the door
whose situation was similar to mine. Bilal passed by us and we said, "Ask
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, if it is enough for
me to maintain my husband and the orphans I have in my care." We said, "Do
not say who we are." He went in and asked him and he said, "Who are they?"
He said, "Zaynab." He said, "Which Zaynab?" He said, "The wife of 'Abdullah."
He said, "Yes, she will have two rewards: the reward of kinship and the reward
of <I>sadaqa</I>."'"
<P>
1398. It is related that Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salama, said, "I said,
'Messenger of Allah, will I have a reward if I maintain the sons of Abu Salama
when they are my sons?' He said, 'Maintain them. You will have a reward for
everything you spend on them.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>XLVIII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"for the ransoming of slaves,
debtors and in the way of Allah."</I> (9:60)</B>
<P>
It is mentioned from Ibn 'Abbas that someone can free slaves with the
<I>zakat</I> on his property and pay for someone to go on hajj. Al-Hasan
said, "It is allowed for someone to free his father out of the <I>zakat</I>
and to give it to people doing <I>jihad</I> and people who have not yet done
hajj." Then he recited, <I>"Zakat is for the poor..." </I>"Anyone who gives
to them, will be rewarded."
<P>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Khalid has kept
his armour for fighting in the way of Allah." It is mentioned from Abu Las,
"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, mounted us on
<I>zakat</I> camels when we went on hajj."
<P>
1399. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, ordered the collection of <I>zakat</I> and
was told that Ibn Jamil, Khalid ibn al-Walid and 'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib
refused to pay. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Why does Ibn Jamil not want to pay when he was poor and Allah and His Messenger
made him rich. As for Khalid, you wrong him. He has kept his armour and weapons
for fighting in the way of Allah. As for al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-Muttalib,
he is the uncle of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and must pay his <I>zakat</I> and the same again with it."
<P>
Ibn Abi'z-Zinad corroborated it from his father.
<P>
It is related from Ibn Abi'z-Zinad, "It is due from him and its like with
it."
<P>
<P>
<B>XLIX: Refraining from begging</B>
<P>
1400. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, "Some of the people of the
Ansar asked something from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and he gave it to them. Then they asked him again and he
gave to them until he had used up everything he had. He said, 'If I had anything
more, I would not withhold it from you. Whoever refrains, Allah will spare
him from needing to ask. Whoever wants to be independent, Allah will make
him so. Whoever shows fortitude, Allah will increase him in it. No one can
be given any better and greater gift than fortitude.'"
<P>
1401. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "By the One in whose hand my self is,
it is better for one of you to take a rope and carry firewood on his back
than for him to go to a man to beg from him who then gives to him or refuses
to."
<P>
1402. It is related from az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "It is better for one of you to take
a rope and bring a faggot of firewood on his back and sell it so that Allah
gives him what he needs than for him to ask people who then give to him or
refuse."
<P>
1403. It is related that Hakim ibn Hizam said, "I asked the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he gave to me and then
I asked him and he gave to me and then I asked him again and he gave to me.
Then he said, 'Hakim, wealth is verdant and sweet. Anyone who takes it in
a generous spirit will be blessed in it but anyone who takes it in an avaricious
way will not be blessed in it, like someone who eats and is not satisfied.
The upper hand is better than the lower hand.'" Hakim said, "I said, 'Messenger
of Allah, by the One who sent you with the Truth, I will never again ask
anyone for anything until I leave this world.'" Abu Bakr called Hakim to
take his share and he refused to take it from him. Then 'Umar called him
to give to him and he refused to accept anything from him either. 'Umar said,
"I call on you to testify, company of Muslims, that I offered Hakim his share
of this booty and he refused to take it. Hakim did not take anything from
any person after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, until he died.
<P>
<P>
<B>L: The one to whom Allah gives something without his asking or being
greedy</B>
<P>
1404. It is related that 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to give me a gift and I would say, 'Give it
to someone who is poorer and more in need of it than I am.' He said, 'Take
it. When some property comes to you without your being greedy for it nor
asking for it, then take it. But if you are not given anything, do not run
after it.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LI: Someone asking from people in order to increase his wealth</B>
<P>
1405. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "A man will continue to ask from other
people until on the Day of Rising he does not have a single piece of flesh
on his face." He said, "The sun will draw near on the Day of Rising until
people's sweat reaches half way up their ears. When they are in that state,
they will seek help first from Adam, then from Musa and then from Muhammad,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
<P>
Ibn Abi Ja'far added, "He will intercede for Allah to judge between His
creatures. He will go on until he takes hold of the ring of the door and
then Allah will raise him to a praiseworthy station and all the people of
the Gathering will praise him."
<P>
Ibn 'Umar related it about asking from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>LII: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"they do not beg of men importunately."
</I>(2:273) How much constitutes wealth</B>
<P>
The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "He does
not have enough wealth to fulfill his needs" about <I>"The poor who are
restrained in the way of Allah </I>...(to)...<I>Allah has knowledge of it.</I>"
(2:273)
<P>
1406. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The very poor man is not the one who asks for
a bite or two to eat, but the one who does not have enough for himself but
is too shy to ask - or does not beg from people importunately."
<P>
1407. It is related from ash-Sha'bi, "The scribe of al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba
related, 'Mu'awiya wrote to al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, "Write for me something
which you heard from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
He wrote to me, "I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
say, 'Allah hates three things for you: Idle chitchat, wastage of wealth
and too much questioning."'"
<P>
1408. It is related that Sa'd said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was distributing things to a group of people while
I was sitting among them." He said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, left out a man whom I admired and did not give to
him. I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and spoke privately to him, 'Messenger of Allah, what about that person?
By Allah, I see him to be a believer <I>(mu'min</I>).' He said, 'Or just
a Muslim?' I was silent for a while and then what I knew about him became
too much for me and I said,. 'Messenger of Allah, What about that person?
By Allah, I see him to be a believer." He said, "I was silent for a while
and then what I knew about him became too much for me and I said, 'What about
that person? By Allah, I see him to be a believer.' He said, 'Or just a Muslim?'
He said, 'I give to one man [and leave out] another I love more than him
out of fear that Allah might throw him on his face into the Fire.'"
<P>
It is related from Isma'il ibn Muhammad that he heard his father relate this.
In his <I>hadith</I>, he said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, struck his hand, grasped me between the shoulder and
neck and said, 'Advance, Sa'd, I will give to the man.'"
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "<I>Kabukbu</I> (17:94) is to fall headfirst. As for
<I>mukibb</I> (grovelling) (67:22), a&nbsp;man grovels &nbsp;"<I>akabba</I>"
when his action does not affect anyone else. When the action occurred, you
say, 'Allah threw him on his face (<I>kabba</I>)' and you say &nbsp;'I threw
him (<I>kababtuhu</I>).'
<P>
1409. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The very poor man is not the one who
who goes around to people for a bite or two to eat or a date or two, but
the one who does not have enough for himself whose condition is not known
so as to ensure his being given sadaqa and does not go and ask people.".
<P>
1410. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "It is better for one of you to take a rope and
and go in the morning (I think he said "to the mountains") and get firewood
and sell it and eat and give <I>sadaqa</I> than for him to go to a man to
beg from him."
<P>
From az-Zuhri who met Ibn 'Umar.
<P>
<P>
<B>LIII: Estimating a quantity of dates</B>
<P>
1411. It is related that Abu Humayd as-Sa'idi said, "We went on the expedition
of Tabuk with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When
he came to Wadi'l-Qura, there was a woman in a walled garden she owned. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,&nbsp;said to his Companions,
'Make an estimation.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, estimated that there were ten <I>wasqs</I>. He said to her, 'Calculate
what it yields.' When we came to Tabuk, he said, 'There will be a strong
gale tonight, so no one should stand up and everyone who has a camel should
hobble it.' We hobbled them and a strong gale blew up and a man stood up
and was blown down the mountain of Tayy'. The King of Ayla gave the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a white mule and clothed him in
a cloak. He wrote to him about their land. When he returned to Wadi'l-Qura,
he said to the woman, 'How much did your garden produce?' She said, 'Ten
<I>wasqs</I>,' which was as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, had estimated. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'I am hurrying back to Madina so anyone who wants to come
with me should make haste.'"
<P>
Then Ibn Bakkar said something which means, "He looked down on Madina and
said, 'This is Taba.' When he saw Uhud, he said, 'This is a mountain which
loves us and which we love. Shall I tell you which are the best households
of the Ansar?' They said, 'Yes.' He said, 'The households of the Banu'n-Najjr,
then the those of the Banu 'Abdu'l-Ashhal, then of the Banu Sa'ida or of
the Banu'l-Harith ibn al-Khazraj, but it (i.e. good) is in all the households
of the Ansar.'"
<P>
[Taba is one of the names of Madina. It means "good, wholesome".]
<P>
'Amr related, "Then the house of the Banu'l-Harith, then the Banu Sa'ida."
<P>
It is related from Ibn 'Abbas from his father that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Uhud is a mountain which loves us and
which we love."
<P>
2688. Abu 'Abdullah said, "Every garden (<I>bustan</I>) which has a wall
is called a <I>hadiqa</I> and one which does not have a wall is not a
<I>hadiqa</I>."
<P>
<P>
<B>LIV: <I>'Ushr </I>(a tenth) is taken from land which is irrigated by rain
water or running water.</B>
<P>
'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz did not think that there was any (<I>zakat</I>) to
pay on honey.
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z34">1412</A>. It is related from Salim ibn 'Abdullah
&#163; that the Prophet * said, "There is <I>'ushr</I> on land watered by
the sky or springs or running springs. There is half of an '<I>ushr </I>(a
twentieth) on land watered by wells."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "This explains the first because in the first there is
no time element involved," i.e. the <I>hadith</I> of Ibn 'Umar: "There is
a tenth on what is irrigated by rain water." It is made clear in this and
the time element indicated. However, more is accepted. That for which there
is clear explanation has more authority than what is unclear, when reliable
people relate it, like in the case of al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas relating that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not pray in the Ka'ba
when Bilal said that he did. What Bilal said is taken and what al-Fadl said
is left.
<P>
<P>
<B>LV: There is no <I>zakat</I> on less than five <I>wasqs</I></B>
<P>
1413. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "No <I>zakat</I> is due
on less than five wasqs. No <I>zakat</I> is due on less than five camels.
No <I>zakat</I> is due on anything less than five <I>uqiyas</I> of silver."
<P>
Abu 'Abdullah said, "This explains the first instance when he said, 'There
is no <I>zakat</I> on less than five <I>wasqs</I>'. In knowledge, one always
takes what firm people add or make clear.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LVI: Taking the <I>zakat</I> of dates when the date-palms are harvested.
Is a child allowed to touch the dates of <I>zakat</I>?</B>
<P>
1414. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was brought the dates when the palm-trees
were harvested. This one would bring his dates and that one would bring his
dates until there was a heap of dates in front of him. Al-Hasan and al-Husayn
began to play with those dates. One of them took a date and put it in his
mouth. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, looked
at him and took it out of his mouth, saying, 'Did you not you know that the
family of Muhammad do not eat the <I>zakat</I>?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LVII. CHAPTER: Someone selling his fruit, palm trees, land or crops when
the<I> 'ushr</I> or <I>zakat</I> is due on them and then paying the
<I>zakat</I> he owes from something else, or selling his fruit before
<I>zakat</I> is due on it. </B>
<P>
The words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Do not
sell dates until it is clear that they are good."
<P>
He did not forbid anyone to sell after this, and did not specify who should
or should not pay the <I>zakat</I>.
<P>
1415. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, forbade selling dates until it was clear that they were
good. When he was asked about when this was, he said, "When the danger of
blight has passed."
<P>
1416. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade selling dates until it was clear that
they were good."
<P>
1417. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade selling dates until they were
fully grown. He said, "Until they are red."
<P>
<P>
<B>LVIII: Can someone buy back his own <I>sadaqa</I>? </B>
<P>
There is nothing wrong in buying what was given by someone else as
<I>sadaqa</I> because the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
only forbade the one giving <I>sadaqa</I> from buying it but did not forbid
anyone else.
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z51">1418</A>. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar
that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab gave a horse as <I>sadaqa</I> in the way of Allah
and then found it being sold and wanted to buy it back. He went to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and consulted him about it. He said,
'Do not take back your <I>sadaqa</I>.' Therefore whenever Ibn 'Umar bought
something he had given as <I>sadaqa</I> he would always give it away again
as <I>sadaqa</I>."
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z50">1419</A>. It is related that 'Umar said, "I gave
away (a mount) a horse in the way of Allah and the person who had it did
not look after it properly. I wanted to buy it back and thought that he would
sell it cheaply. I asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said, 'Do not buy it nor take back your <I>sadaqa</I> even if he were
to give it to you for a dirham. The one who takes back his <I>sadaqa</I>
is like the one who swallows his own vomit.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LIX: What is mentioned about sadaqa given to the Prophet</B>
<P>
1420. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "Al-Husayn ibn 'Ali took a date
from the sadaqa dates and put it in his mouth. The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'No, no!' so that he would spit it out. He
said, 'Are you not aware that we do not eat <I>sadaqa</I>?'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LX: Sadaqa to the clients of the wives of the Prophet</B>
<P>
1421. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, found a dead sheep which had been given as <I>sadaqa</I>
to a client of Maymuna. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'Why don't you use its skin?' They said, 'It is carrion.' He said,
'It is only unlawful to eat it.'"
<P>
1422. It is related from al-Aswad that 'A'isha wanted to buy Barira to set
her free and her masters wanted to stipulate keeping her <I>wala</I>' as
a precondition. 'A'isha mentioned it to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said to her, "Buy her. The <I>wala' </I>belongs to the one who sets free."
She said, "Some meat was brought to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, &nbsp;and I said, 'This was given as <I>sadaqa</I> to Barira.'
He said, 'It is <I>sadaqa</I> for her and a gift for us.'"
<P>
[Keeping the <I>wala' </I>would make them her heirs.]
<P>
<P>
<B>LXI: When <I>sadaqa</I> is transferred</B>
<P>
1423. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya al-Ansariyya said, "The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to 'A'isha and asked, 'Do you have
anything?' She said, 'No, except what Nusayba sent to me from the sheep which
was sent to her as <I>sadaqa</I>. He said, 'It has reached its place.'"
<P>
1424. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, was brought some meat which had been given as <I>sadaqa</I> to
Barira and said, 'It is <I>sadaqa</I> for her and a gift for us.'"
<P>
Qatada heard it from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXII: Taking <I>sadaqa</I> from the rich and giving it to the poor wherever
they are</B>
<P>
1425. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said to Mu'adh ibn Jabal when he sent him
to Yemen, "You are going to a people who have a Book. When you come to them,
call on them to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah. When they obey you in that, then tell them that
Allah has made the five prayers obligatory for them in a twenty-four day.
When they obey you in that, inform them that Allah has made it obligatory
for <I>zakat</I> to be taken from their property and given to their poor.
If they obey you in that, beware of the precious things of people and beware
of the supplication of the wronged. There is no screen between him and Allah."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIII: The prayer of the Imam and his supplication for someone who gives
<I>sadaqa</I></B>
<P>
His words,<I> "Take sadaqa from their wealth to purify and cleanse them and
pray for them. Your prayers bring relief to them." </I>(9:103)
<P>
1426. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa said, "When people brought
their <I>sadaqa</I> to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
he would say, 'O Allah, bless the family of so-and-so.' My father took his
<I>sadaqa</I> to him and said, 'O Allah, bless the family of Abu Awfa.'"
<P>
<P>
<B>LXIV: Things taken out of the sea</B>
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, 'Ambergris is not buried wealth, but something cast out
by the sea." Al-Hasan said, "There is a fifth on ambergris and pearls." The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, appointed a fifth on buried
treasure, but not on things is taken out of the water.
<P>
1427. It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, that a man of the Banu Isra'il asked someone of the
Banu Isra'il to lend him a thousand dinars and he gave it to him. He set
out to the sea but could not find a boat. He took a piece of wood and bored
a hole in it, put the thousand dinars in it and threw it into the sea. The
man who had lent it to him went out and found the piece of wood. He took
it as a firewood for his family." And he mentioned in the <I>hadith</I> that
when he sawed it up he found the money."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXV: There is a fifth (<I>khums</I>) on buried treasure</B>
<P>
Malik and Ibn Idris said, "Treasure (<I>rikaz</I>) was buried in the time
of <I>Jahiliyya</I>, and there is a fifth on it, be it small or great. Mines
are not buried treasure. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Nothing is taken on mines and there is a fifth on buried treasure."
<P>
'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz took fifth from every two hundred in minerals."
<P>
Al-Hasan said, "There is <I>khums</I> on buried treasure in enemy territory,
and there is only <I>zakat</I> if it is in the land of peace. If something
lost is found in enemy territory, it is made known. If it belongs to an enemy,
there is a fifth on it."
<P>
Some people said that mines are the same as what was buried in the time of
<I>Jahiliyya</I> because one uses the verb "<I>arkaza</I>" for the mine
producing, meaning when something is brought out of it. It is said to the
one who is given something who has a lot of profit or a lot of fruitt, "You
have found a treasure (<I>arkazat</I>.") Then he said, "There is no harm
if he conceals it and does not pay the fifth."
<P>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z9">1428</A>. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There
is no payment on dumb animals, no payment on wells and there is a fifth on
buried treasure."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVI: The words of Allah Almighty, <I>"those who work to collect it."</I>
(9:60) It is up to the Imam to supervise the <I>zakat</I>-collectors</B>
<P>
1429. It is related that Abu Humayd as-Sa'idi said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, appointed a man of al-Asad called
Ibn al-Lutbiya to collect the <I>zakat</I> of the Banu Sulaym. When he came,
he checked it."
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVII: Using the <I>zakat</I> camels and their milk for travellers</B>
<P>
1430. It is related that Anas said, "Some people came from [the tribe of]
'Urayna and became ill. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, allowed them to go to the <I>zakat</I>-camels and to drink their
urine and milk [for their treatment]. They killed the herdsman of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and drove the camels away. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent and they were brought
to him and he had their hands and feet cut off and nails were driven in their
eyes and they were left in al-Harra' biting stones (due to thirst)."
<P>
Abu Qilaba, Humayd and Thabit corroborated it from Anas.
<P>
<P>
<B>LXVIII: The ruler branding the <I>zakat</I>-camels with his own hand</B>
<P>
1431. It is related that Anas ibn Malik &nbsp;said, "I took 'Abdullah ibn
Abi Talha to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
so he could do <I>tahnik</I> for him. I found him with a branding-iron in
his hand with which he was branding the <I>zakat</I> camels."
<P>
[Tahnik is to chew a date and rub the child's gums with it.]

obligatory.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z52">1432</A>. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made <I>zakat
al-Fitr</I> obligatory for the Muslims - slave and free, male and female,
young and old, being a<I> sa' </I>of dates or a<I> sa' </I>of barley. He
commanded that it be paid before people went out to the prayer."

1434. It is related that Abu Sa'id said, "The food we gave as <I>sadaqa</I>
was <I>a sa' </I>of barley."
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<B>IV: The <I>Sadaqat al-Fitr </I>is a sa' of food</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<A HREF="muw5.html#z54">1435</A>. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri
said, "We used to pay out the <I>zakat al-Fitr </I>with <I>a sa' </I>of food
[grain], a<I> sa'</I> of barley, a<I> sa' </I>of dates, a<I> sa' </I>of cottage

<B>V: <I>Sadaqat al-Fitr</I> is a <I>sa'</I> of dates</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
1436. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, commanded the <I>zakat al-Fitr</I> to be a<I> sa' </I>of
dates or a <I>sa' </I>of barley." 'Abdullah said, "People equate it with

al-Fitr </I>with a <I>sa' </I>of food [grain], a <I>sa' </I>of dates, a<I>

al-Fitr</I> (or he said Ramadan) obligatory for the Muslims - male and female,
slave and free, being a<I> sa' </I>of dates or a<I> sa' </I>of barley. The
people made it equal to half a<I> sa' </I>of wheat.

Ibn 'Umar used to give dates. The people of Madina had a shortage of dates
and gave barley. Ibn 'Umar used to pay for the young and old. He even used
